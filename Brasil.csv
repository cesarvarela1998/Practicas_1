"Cherry, plum and earth aromas form a sound bouquet. This Merlot is full, round and well balanced. Flavors of black fruits are helped along by integrated spice and earth tones, while the finish shows ripeness and a smooth texture.",Brazil,Merlot
"Taut, dense and ripe, this 50/50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot opens with aromas of chocolate-covered cherries and cherry cordial. The palate is dry and concentrated with medium acidity and a tannin structure that calls for a knife and fork. Give it a few years.",Brazil,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Overly earthy, but ripe and concentrated with flavors of vanilla and plum pudding. The long, tannic finish is redolent of well-used leather.",Brazil,Red Blend
"A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot, the Miolo Cuvée Giuseppe has a slightly sherried nose along with flavors of baked cherries, humus and apple pie. Sinewy tannins and black raspberries characterize the medium finish.",Brazil,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"An earthy blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with flavors of raspberry cordial and rhubarb couched in burly, slightly drying tannins. Medium, char-inflected finish.",Brazil,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Simple but pleasing, with high-toned strawberry, tree bark and cedar scents that wind down to a woodsy palate with plush tannins and a short, mixed-berry finish. Drink up.",Brazil,Merlot
"There's some density here but also rustic scents on the nose and a liquor-like character to the palate. Drying tannins overwhelm the thin midpalate, resulting in an imbalanced impression.",Brazil,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pretty nice for a Brazilian sparkler, with a sweet, frosted-cake nose that's a bit gassy. Plump and candied on the palate, with apple and melon flavors. Loud and full, but clumsy. Shows good base qualities; needs refinement.",Brazil,Sparkling Blend
"This is mentholated and spicy, with a brandied cherry note as the dominant aroma. Tight but not too severe, it would pair well with meat. Its flavors of raspberry and dry plum are tasty, and the finish hits hard with tightness featuring dry raspberry and cherry skin. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc, Merlot and Malbec.",Brazil,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
This opens with dusty dried-apple aromas. High acidity preserves its composure even though the fruit is marginal and vacillates between flavors of apple and lemony citrus.,Brazil,Sparkling Blend
"This is jumpy and aggressive on the nose, with lemon-lime aromas akin to Sprite. Grabby almost to the point of being cloying, it is driven by classic Moscato flavors of lime and sweet lychee. It's chalky without a good follow through.",Brazil,Moscato
"This wine's cola, forest floor, cherry and cassis aromas are promising, but on the palate it's a tannic crusher, with mouth-blasting acids. It feels abrasive and tastes of rubbery black fruits.",Brazil,Merlot
"Notes of cherry and wet-animal fur define the nose. The palate is lean and juicy, with acidity and tannic grip. It tastes tart and shallow, with foxy red-fruit flavors.",Brazil,Tannat
"Applesauce and wheat aromas immediately make this wine slightly unappealing. In the mouth, it feels bubbly and fruity, with candied apple and orange flavors, followed by a finish that's a mix of sweet corn and dry citrus.",Brazil,Sparkling Blend
