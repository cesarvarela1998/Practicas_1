"Dark violet-red in color, this wine has a bouquet of blueberry, brambles and flint. It is soft on entry, with a web of tannins that spreads across the palate. Flavors of cherry preserves, bacon and juniper berry are at play in the mouth, and bright fruit notes and tactile tannins come in waves through the lingering finish.",India,Shiraz
"Aromas of blackberry, cherry preserves, white chocolate and a hint of green pepper prepare the taste buds for flavors of forest-fruit, smoked pork, black pepper, violet and almond blossom. A trio of fruit, savory tones and spice travels across the palate on a layer of smooth tannins, leading to a smoky finish.",India,Shiraz
"A nose of cut herbs and just-mown grass backed by notes of white peach barely prepares the taste buds for full-on citrus flavors of lemon, grapefruit and orange peel. It is bright and zesty on the palate, and the finish offers an unexpected but pleasant jolt of eucalyptus.",India,Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of pink grapefruit, grass and coriander seed open the palate of this wine. Passion fruit, apricot, green apple and freshly chopped parsley mark the palate, with a touch of iodine on the finish.",India,Sauvignon Blanc
"Pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot show brightly on the nose and palate. Simultaneously refreshing and sophisticated on the palate, this wine has a crisp, lingering finish laced with flavors of almond blossom.",India,Chenin Blanc
"This wine features a fresh nose of grapefruit and lemon peel. It is bright on the palate, offering flavors of grapefruit, pear and green apple. It remains crisp and clean across the entire tongue right into the orange zest finish.",India,Chenin Blanc
"Charred wood and smoke dominate the nose and palate of this Indian Cab, smoldering over a core of plush black fruit that hides within. It's a pleasantly textured wine with soft, fine-grained tannins, but overwhelmed by smoke and a stalky, green finish.",India,Cabernet Sauvignon
