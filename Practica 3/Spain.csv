"Ripe aromas of fig, blackberry and cassis are softened and sweetened by a slathering of oaky chocolate and vanilla. This is full, layered, intense and cushioned on the palate, with rich flavors of chocolaty black fruits and baking spices. A toasty, everlasting finish is heady but ideally balanced. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Tinta de Toro

"Slightly gritty black-fruit aromas include a sweet note of pastry along with a hint of prune. Wall-to-wall saturation ensures that all corners of one's mouth are covered. Flavors of blackberry, mocha and chocolate are highly impressive and expressive, while this settles nicely on a long finish. Drink now through 2024.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Lush cedary black-fruit aromas are luxe and offer notes of marzipan and vanilla. This bruiser is massive and tannic on the palate, but still lush and friendly. Chocolate is a key flavor, while baked berry and cassis flavors are hardly wallflowers. On the finish, this is tannic and deep as a sea trench. Drink this saturated black-colored Toro through 2023.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Nicely oaked blackberry, licorice, vanilla and charred aromas are smooth and sultry. This is an outstanding wine from an excellent year. Forward barrel-spice and mocha flavors adorn core blackberry and raspberry fruit, while this runs long and tastes vaguely chocolaty on the velvety finish. Enjoy this top-notch Tempranillo through 2030.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Alluring, complex and powerful aromas of grilled meat, berries, tea, smoke, vanilla and spice cover every base. An intense palate is concentrated but still elegant. Blackberry, molasses and mocha flavors finish with chocolaty oak notes, fine tannins and overall cohesion. Drink this special Rioja from 2020 through 2035.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Tarry blackberry and cheesy oak aromas are appropriate for a wine of this size and magnitude. In the mouth, this Tinta de Toro is expansive and grabby, with bullish tannins. Slightly salty earthy accents come with core blackberry flavors and notes of baking spices and chocolate, while on the finish this is long, chocolaty, delicious and not too hard or tannic. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Earthy plum and cherry aromas score points for being clear and direct. The palate on this varietal Mencía is round, smooth and just right. Lightly briny, earthy plum and cherry flavors hold steady on the finish, with a dash of saltiness.",Spain,Mencía
"This comes across wide and expansive as it lazily exudes oily aromas of hazelnut and toffee. A plump palate is not overly cutting or demanding, while flavors of lightly salted nuts and buttered toast end with toffee and peanut flavors.",Spain,Palomino
"Aromas of brandied cherry and crème de cassis include a horsey sidenote and some heat. This sweet Monastrell smacks the palate with hard tannins. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and baked plum finish blocky.",Spain,Monastrell

"Dusty, leesy aromas of apple and vanilla are sturdy. This brut Cava is fresh and modestly elegant on the palate, with lime, apple and tarragon flavors. A dry, confident finish offers apple and citrus flavors and a sense of ease.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of leather, roast plum and compost are challenging and not immediately inviting. In the mouth, this shows rubbery tannins and juicy acidity. Saucy, herbal plum and currant flavors ride on a beam of acidity toward an earthy, tomatoey finish with a lightly leafy aftertaste.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dense, tarry aromas of asphalt and rubbery boysenberry are hefty but also a bit flat. This has a tannic mouthfeel to go with blackberry, prune and raisin flavors. Toast, bitter chocolate and full-bodied weight push the finish on this oaky, ripe Rioja. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Pleasant red-fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry are low in octane for Toro. A fresh but not overly dense palate is lively and vital, with wild berry, plum and brown sugar flavors. A warm, heady, generous finish is fruity and bright. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Apple, nectarine, lees and briny aromas steer this Godello toward a round, full palate. Slightly bitter flavors of melon and peach finish much like the wine starts—briny and leesy. This is also pithy tasting, like the inside of a grapefruit peel.",Spain,Godello
"Coffee grinds, raisin and baked aromas suggest overripeness. This is heavy, broad and a bit clumsy on the palate. Berry and prune flavors are solid but not overly fresh, while the finish is full and raisiny as it improves over time.",Spain,Red Blend
"A mix of smoke and toast blends with fresh, crisp citrus aromas on the nose. That's followed by a foamy, reactive palate with flavors of pink grapefruit, orange, pepper and caramel. This remains foamy on the finish, which is peppery and slightly bitter in flavor.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is brilliantly purple in color, with jumpy, untamed black-fruit aromas. In the mouth, it is tannic and clawing, with a cheek-drilling mouthfeel. Syrupy blackberry flavors offer baking spice and clove accents, while the finish is showing unabsorbed oak and monster tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty black cherry and dark plum aromas are ripe and friendly. This is a plump, modern-style red with a clean mouthfeel and weight.

"Spicy yet sweet aromas of sarsaparilla root, saddle leather and earthy berry fruits precede a rich dense palate. This tastes of dark cherry and berry fruit, with an herbal shading adding complexity. Chocolaty oak takes hold on a solid long finish. Drink through 2024.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ripe pure black-fruit aromas are touched up by notes of malty chocolate and mocha. This is proportionally big, with cheek-grabbing tannins, but it's not overly hard or unbalanced— just the opposite. Flavors of mocha, coffee, hazelnut and ripe berry fruits finish flush, dense and firm, with toasty notes and powerful but controlled residual tannins. Drink through 2030.",Spain,Red Blend

"Aromas of mulled black fruits, vanilla, tobacco, orange peel and earth are a touch jumbled, but compartmentalized—this smells nice. Wiry and fresh in feel, but with a slightly hollow midsection, this tastes peppery, oaky and like cherry and black plum. A toasty finish with snappy acidity solidifies this medium-weight La Mancha Tempranillo. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Apple, lime and mineral aromas lend freshness to a mature nose. This feels round and plump, but well balanced due to fine acidity. Peach and citrus flavors are stony and finish with tropical notes of lychee and mango. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"The first thing that leaps at you on this oddball blend of Albillo, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier is toasty oak, which overrides spice and apple aromas. In the mouth, this is full, resiny and grabby. Oak-driven flavors of vanilla, lees, peach and white pepper finish long, with elegance and a woody aftertaste.",Spain,White Blend
"A mix of smoke and toast blends with fresh, crisp citrus aromas on the nose. That's followed by a foamy, reactive palate with flavors of pink grapefruit, orange, pepper and caramel. This remains foamy on the finish, which is peppery and slightly bitter in flavor.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Raspberry, red currant and a pinch of oaky maple make up the nose on this Tinto Fino that sports a medium-weight body with medium-level intensity. Red-berry flavors follow the nose, while a crisp finish with red plum and raspberry flavors wraps things up.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Initial aromas of aged cheese, gym shoes and overall funk are more complicated than easy. This is lacks a center point on the palate, while flavors of briny stone fruits are drawn, buttery and oxidized. A briny apricot note rises up on the finish.",Spain,Sherry
"Wiry aromas of berry and spice are tempered by a touch of oaky vanilla. On the palate, there's a blend of creamy oak and sharp acidity, while flavors of plum and boysenberry are tart overall but again softened by barrel-driven vanilla notes. Snappy acidity makes for a moderately sharp, pointed finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smooth, nutty aromas include vanilla and flor scents. This has a dry palate with flavors of orange, lemon, salt and peanuts. It's crisp but metallic in feel, with angular acidity and a finish that's salty in flavor and slightly oily in texture.",Spain,Sherry
"Crisp, minty, herbal aromas of berry and plum lead to a bright, rumbling, tannic palate with energy. Blackberry and chocolate flavors are good and earthy, while the finish is plump but braced by lively acidity. This is well made and satisfying for a basic roble wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Berry and cherry aromas are fruity and clean. This blend of Carignan, Grenache and Syrah is big on the palate but also tannic, acidic and fierce. Black plum, blackberry and tomato flavors finish crisp and firm.",Spain,Red Blend
"Earthy berry and licorice aromas are composed, lightly oaked and attractive. This standard Priorato blend of Grenache, Carignan and Syrah is fresh feeling, with a bolt of bracing acidity. Juicy plum and raspberry flavors finish loamy, earthy and balanced. For a wine that's no heavyweight, this is strong throughout. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Red Blend
"Look for the blue bottle and you'll get a solid Albariño. This is typically light and fresh, with aromas of stream water, wild flowers, fresh herbs and leesy stone fruits.

"Briary, dry, lightly oaked aromas of plum and berry lead to a bright, forward, juicy palate with fresh acidity and racy flavors of cherry and plum. This is short but clean on the finish, and overall it's the type of simple, drinkable, affordable Ribera del Duero that fans of the region don't come across often enough.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mineral, citrus and dusty aromas are textbook for brut Cava. A round, full palate shows good grip and acidity, while flavors of lemon-lime and nectarine finish with notes of lime and green banana. Nothing about this is overwhelming, but the sum of its parts add up.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Baked, rooty aromas of sandalwood, exotic spices and berry fruits are attractive. Though slightly grabby on the palate, this shows the right structure and build. Flavors of up-front oak, herbal plum and raspberry finish dry, with firm, pinching tannins. Drink through 2021.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Berry and cinnamon aromas are lightly woody and spicy. This is tannic but not mean or fierce. Flavors of oaky plum and berry fruits turn savory in front of a finish with a dry, snappy, slightly raw feel. Given that 2013 was a cold vintage, this Crianza deserves praise.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Deep dark berry aromas come with notes of vanilla, gritty spice and tobacco. Hard tannins require cushion and this has just enough to handle things. Blackberry, cassis, barrel spice and molasses flavors finish with savory oak notes, chocolate and lingering blackberry fruit. Drink through 2030.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Like it's bigger sibling El Anejón, this Reserva from a warm vintage is almost one-quarter Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in addition to Tinto Fino (Tempranillo). The opening of burnt earth, brandied cherry, rubber and herbal aromas is distinct. This feels a bit tough and chewy, with boysenberry, cassis, vanilla-cream and herbal spice flavors. A fairly smooth finish is young and vital. This should improve with aging. Best from 2019–2026.",Spain,Red Blend

Finishing notes of brown sugar and berry syrup are chocolaty and ensure that this finishes better than it begins.",Spain,Red Blend
"Concentrated aromas of blackened oak, blackberry, cassis, licorice and hickory smoke are clarion calls that this is a fully oaked, modern wine. In the mouth, it's heavy and tannic but doesn't trip over itself. Blackberry, cassis, burnt toast and campfire flavors finish equally toasted, peppery, charred and lemony, with chewy tannins. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Red Blend
"Smoky, oaky, charred flavors of savory plum and berry lead to a full, layered palate with slightly abrasive tannins. This tastes of grilled beef, lemon peel, toast, cassis and chocolate. A toasted character remains on a solid finish. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend

An elegant finish with stone-fruit and green-herb notes is sophisticated.",Spain,Sparkling Blend

"Flawless on the nose, this amontillado purchased from the solera of Señor González Obregón is full of lift, power and toffee on the nose. There's zero excess weight to the palate, which features flavors of nuts, salt, caramel and dried apricot. On the finish, a hint of buttered toast offers an umami offset to acid-driven raciness.",Spain,Sherry
"This modern-style Tempranillo is registering at max ripeness. Aromas of black fruits, raisin, tire rubber and toasty French oak project a dark outlook. In the mouth, this is tight and gripping. Flavors of blackened oak, cassis and blackberry finish firm and closed, with manageable tannins. Drink through 2025.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rosy cherry and plum aromas turn more rubbery and raisiny as this airs out. Solid, lifted and deep on the palate, this varietal Garnacha deals lightly herbal, floral flavors of plum and cherry cough drop, while the finish is oaky, resiny, raw, scouring and tough. Nothing about this is subtle or elegant, but it is dynamic. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Garnacha

"While 2010 was a great vintage in most of Spain, parts of Bierzo had a mildew problem and thus some wines are less than fully ripe. This seems to be a case in point; it's scratchy on the nose, with a sinewy, drawing mouthfeel that's only partly covered up by oak. Prickly berry and black cherry flavors finish tight, with scraping tannins. Drink now with meat or cheese.",Spain,Mencía

"Aromas of roasted earth, leather and fine oak are more out-front than berry fruit, and that's the way it should be for a Gran Reserva. This feels bold, lively and still a touch bumpy. Chocolaty oak and vanilla notes rest comfortably on top of ripe berry and black-plum flavors, while the finish is persistently earthy and chocolaty. Drink through 2028.",Spain,Tempranillo
A ripe fruity set of berry and cassis aromas shows a slight hint of raisin. This is a stacked saturated wine with raw tannins and plenty of power. Blackberry and earthy notes finish stout and compact: this doesn't vary or waver on the back end. Best from 2019–2026.,Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A more intense version of Carraovejas's Reserva from 2012, this also includes more than 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Thus it's spicy and prickly on the nose, with road tar and peppery notes in addition to potent berry fruit. A rich saturated rumbling palate deals coffee, toast, blackberry and herbal flavors that are much like the Reserva but more amplified. A charred finish has a lemony ring to it. Drink from 2020 through 2030.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pine notes and an aroma akin to floor polish make for an iffy start. This carries a slight chemical flavor as it moves along, while honey and brown-sugar notes sweeten things up. A chunky, obtuse finish feels sticky due to mild acidity.",Spain,Moscatel

Flavors of ripe blackberry and cherry share the stage with toasty, charred oak and spice flavors in front of an aggressive but tasty finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"On the nose, this is challenging: gaseous, oaky aromas of wet cement also contain notes of bitter lettuce, baking spices and general grit. Raw, tannic and abrasive on the palate, this unfolds to offer herbal flavors of berry and plum. Tannic, scratchy, rugged and mildly green on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Muscular, leathery aromas of dark-berry fruits come with a can't-miss animal element. This Grenache-Carignan blend features a powerful grip and grabby texture. Earthy, jammy flavors of raspberry and plum end with herbal accents, dry spice and the taste of bitter black cherry.",Spain,Red Blend
"Raw, lightly leafy red-berry aromas properly announce what amounts to a juicy, snappy Tempranillo with berry, spice and dry oak flavors. A dry feeling, peppery tasting finish is traditional for good, basic Spanish table wine.",Spain,Tempranillo

"Varietally specific aromas of wild flowers, honey and lemon verbena set up an unctuous, creamy palate with modest acidity and lots of weight. Honey, mango, vanilla and other sweet, tropical flavors finish thick but not quite cloying. This is a unique wine for Navarra that deserves to be judged on its own.",Spain,Moscatel
"Typical for this winery, this smells a bit herbal, with tomato and earthy plum aromas leading the way. Scratchy, grabby tannins support savory, herbal berry flavors. Hard tannins struggle to resolve themselves on a firm, muscular finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is a ripe, earthy, modern-leaning Rioja with aromas of blackberry, raisin and rubber. Soft and fleshy on the palate, what this easygoing number lacks in structure is made up for in charm.

"Earthy berry and raisin aromas announce a warm, ripe wine. This feels plump, grapy and chunky, with moderate acidity. Grapy, bold flavors of raspberry, prune and cherry are earthy and loamy, while ripeness and a raisiny element carry onto the finish. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Garnacha
"Aromas of earthy, nutty, mature berry fruits come with a hint of raisin and a touch of compost. This saturated Vino de Cádiz is composed of 80% Syrah, with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a heavy wine with flavors of vanilla, burnt wood, blackened spices and stewed berries. The finish tastes peppery, dark and outright woody. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Red Blend
"This blend from Cádiz features Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's big, ripe and minty on the nose, with hints of animal fur and leather. A blocky, full palate weighs in at 15.5%, while flavors of oak and vanilla blend well with spiced berry fruit. A drying finish tastes mostly of oak. Drink through 2025.",Spain,Red Blend

"Off the bat, this smells a bit like fruit punch, although with time it stiffens. A chunky heavy somewhat flat palate tastes of clove, chocolate and berry and plum.",Spain,Red Blend

"Earthy, ripe, slightly flat aromas of black fruits define the nose on this dense Toro. Soft, mellow, quiet flavors of blackberry and raisin finish rich, loamy and with a note of prune. Drink this ripe, fairly sweet-tasting wine now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Oak, density and medicinal berry aromas are the three most prominent characteristics on the nose of this carbonic macerated Tempranillo. In the mouth, it's full and a bit grabby. Flavors of smoky oak and hickory vie with black-fruit tastes, while the finish is firm and dry, with residual woodiness.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Floral, stony red-fruit aromas are the right set up for a tight, almost citric feeling palate. Flavors of cherry and red plum are narrow and quick-hitting, while the finish is bright, juicy and runs on acidity. This demands food; it's raw by itself.",Spain,Red Blend
"This modern Rioja opens with sweet, jammy, raisiny aromas and spice. The palate is cumbersome, with tomatoey acidity providing spine.

"Earth, leather and strong but quality oak notes accent berry-fruit aromas. Cheek-sucking tannins make for a rugged mouthfeel.

Drink through 2025.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty toffee and dried stone-fruit aromas are pure and inviting. This is ultra crisp and fresh, with ripping acidity. Flavors of toffee, salted peanuts and sharp-leaning dry white fruits finish racy and with precision. This is a classic complex amontillado purchased from the cellar of Manuel Cuevas Jurado.",Spain,Sherry
"Raspberry, plum and cherry aromas are light, pure and fully inviting, with nothing off-putting. This tastes bright and balanced, with cherry and berry flavors that are impossible not to like. A dash of oaky cocoa blends with leftover red fruit flavors on a nice finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend

"Cidery aromas vie with bready notes to give the bouquet complexity. This feels zesty, juicy and citric, with a lean, racy body. Apple cider, green herb, lime and scallion flavors finish with a lasting taste of lime.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Stripped-back cherry and raspberry flavors take on a jammy character with airing. This is tight, bright and mildly acidic on the palate, with raspberry, red plum and brown sugar flavors. Toast and a molasses-like sweetness carry an otherwise juicy finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Blackberry, cherry and earthy aromas are backed by a secondary wave of oaky char. This is 80% Garnacha and 20% Carignan with raw clamp to the palate created by grabby tannins and tomatoey acidity. Briny raspberry and plum flavors finish with rubbery tannins and related grab. This is a tough wine but one with lots of life and power. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Red Blend

Holding this for another couple of years may or may not soften this fierce but tasty RDD.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is one of the most inky, concentrated, fiercely tannic vintages of Alion to date. Aromas of granite, boysenberry and grilled meat feed into a biting, full-bodied palate that can only benefit from more time. Blackberry, vanilla and chocolate flavors finish with mocha notes and stocky, rugged tannins. This is fierce and unrefined now; drink from 2018 through 2027.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's no denying that this is a heavily oaked Rioja with toast, resin, vanilla and cheesy aromas alongside fully ripe blackberry and prune notes. There's energy to the palate, while previously mentioned heavy oak spawns flavors of vanilla and spice to go with berry fruit. A mouth-coating, woody finish stands out on this compartmentalized Tempranillo-led blend. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Pine resin and a light, oily brine character define the nose on this lithe, fresh fino. Crisp acidity and healthy weight mesh into balance on an easy-to-navigate palate. Flavors of almond, sea brine and toffee finish crisp.",Spain,Sherry
"Aromas of freshly baked bread, toast and melon are soft and welcoming. This Pinot Noir-led Cava feels plump, with moderate acidity. Flavors of melon, quince and pear finish mild, with only a bit of kick.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Light plum and raspberry aromas include notes of animal and latex. This lightweight Garnacha has a monotone mouthfeel, while hollow simple berry flavors finish with acidic tang.",Spain,Garnacha
"Herbal tomato and red-berry aromas are jumbled and fail to state much of a case for this multigrape blend. Herbal spicy tea and raspberry flavors finish jagged, with mild heat.",Spain,Red Blend
"This blend is so oaky and sticky on the nose that it smells like a Hershey's Kiss. The palate is out of balance, with chunky weight and unintegrated acidity. Like the nose, this tastes like a drugstore chocolate bar, while the finish is hot.",Spain,Red Blend
"Reduced jammy black-fruit aromas announce a scratchy palate with spritz. This multigrape blend tastes saucy and stewed, while hard tannins and a note of burnt coffee control the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Clove and beef jerky aromas are odd and forceful. A globular palate lacks form and balance, while this tastes oddly and singularly of clove.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Stalky, grassy, briny aromas of red-berry fruits run low on ripeness. This is tangy and tomatoey in feel, with tart plum and tomato flavors. A snappy, zesty, crisp finish is raw and cutting. Drink this wine now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Jammy, candied aromas suggest cherry Kool-Aid. This Carignan-Grenache-Syrah blend is narrow and juicy in feel, with raw red-fruit flavors that are also candied and suggestive of animal. This is decent but raw on the finish and overall does not deliver much pleasure.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stripped-back cherry and raspberry flavors take on a jammy character with airing. This is tight, bright and mildly acidic on the palate, with raspberry, red plum and brown sugar flavors. Toast and a molasses-like sweetness carry an otherwise juicy finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Mild aromas of cherry and nectarine come across simple and sweet. Following the nose's lead, this is mellow on the palate, with raspberry and cherry flavors that are, once again, a bit sweet in character. A controlled, candied finish is consistent with what came before it.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Full, intense blackberry aromas skirt complexity but score points via power and grit. Rubbery tannins and plenty of oak give this weight and strength, while flavors of blackberry, black currant and chocolate are ripe and good. A toasty, oaky finish reveals enough blackberry flavor to make this right.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light pops of cherry and raspberry aromas emerge from a low-volume, feminine bouquet. This Trepat is typically fresh, with a lean body and citric acidity. Peppery red-fruit flavors include modestly applied oak, while the finish is long, and lightly spiced, with unspecific red-berry flavors.",Spain,Trepat
"Strong classy oak aromas lead blackberry and baking-spice scents on a potent but textbook RDD nose. This old-vines wine from a benchmark year is tight-fisted and linear in feel, with lemony acidity. Fully oaked flavors of blackberry and cassis sit comfortably on a bed of herb and spice notes, while this is oaky, spicy, steady and integrated on the finish. Drink through 2027.",Spain,Tempranillo

"Earthy plum and raspberry aromas are subtle. This is tight on the palate, with firm tannins and slightly elevated acidity. Earthy, lightly toasted raspberry and plum flavors finish dry. As a whole, this is well made and exceeds expectations.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Grapy aromas seem simple at first, but with time tarry black plum and citrus peel notes emerge. This is very tannic, arguably a bit too much so. Plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors end with a reverb of hard tannins. For best results, give this as much air as possible.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Forward berry aromas are more clean and fresh than complex. On the palate, this is similar, with bold, freshening acidity. Flavorwise, this leans into the black-fruit spectrum, while mint, spice and peppery flavors grace the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Spiced cherry and berry aromas are common but good. A bright, acidic palate feels perfectly healthy and lively, while flavors of plum and berry fruits get a dusting of dry spice. A slow-driving finish offers a steady ending.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This single-vineyard Carignan is living proof of how impressive the variety can be, especially when hailing from a top year like 2012. Schisty aromas of blackberry, chocolate and mocha are smooth and alluring. This feels focused, pure and juicy, while dense blackberry, mocha and baking spice flavors tail off with exotic notes of Malabar pepper, toast and the finest black coffee. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Carignan
"Almond and a hint of raspberry register on an otherwise neutral nose. This feels round and citrusy, while flavors of orange, nectarine and pithy pink grapefruit end with a slight note of oxidation. Drink immediately.",Spain,Rosado
"Despite some heat and burn to the nose, there's nothing not to like about aromas of pecan pie and toffee. This Moscatel sweetie is solid in feel, but mostly around the edges; the middle palate is a bit weak. Flavors of brown sugar and caramel are more sweet and simple than complex.",Spain,Sherry
"Spicy, gritty cherry aromas are dry and hard, but honest and fresh. This Cab Franc has a narrow, tannic, punchy mouthfeel and oak-rich flavors of red plum and currant along with vanilla. The finish is lively at first then fades away quietly.",Spain,Cabernet Franc
"Dusty, briny citrus and apple aromas lead to a palate that's calm and only mildly bubbly and active. Lightly pickled lime and tangerine flavors finish dry, slightly bitter and briny, with a coarse but crisp feel of seltzer.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This light, airy varietal Pedro Xímenez offers leesy, melony aromas. The palate has a creamy feel bolstered by acidic zip. Leesy, waxy flavors of lime, melon and apple finish long, with tropical leanings. Drink this dry PX now.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Earthy berry scents and charred aromas of grilled steak include notes of wood spice and vanilla. On the palate, this is deep, and shows a good mix of bright acidity and meaty depth. Flavors of toasty oak, chocolate, blackberry and pepper finish with persistent chocolaty notes and intense acidity. Drink through 2028.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The nose on this ripe Tinta de Toro is dense, bold and brimming with black-fruit aromas. Following the nose, this tastes of blackberry, cassis and various spices, while finishing black-fruit flavors are lightly herbal, spicy and complex. This offers a touch of everything good, and even more when it comes to ripe fruit. Drink through 2024.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Dark smoky, stout aromas of licorice, molasses and blackberry feed into a jammy palate with rock-hard, clamping tannins.

On the finish, mild herbal complexity mixed with latent oak are stirring. Drink through 2026.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This is an edgy wine with a mix of berry and cassis aromas along with harsh leather. It's mouthfilling and potent on the palate, where flavors of spiced berry and herbal-infused plum finish scratchy and with all the muscle one could ask for. Cariñena, Garnacha and Syrah is the blend.",Spain,Red Blend

Clove, woodsmoke, BBQ sauce and other savory flavors are barrel driven, while the finish registers as dense, roasted and a bit hot.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This is a perfectly good rosé that's 90% Tempranillo and 10% Viura, hence the Clarete name. Fresh aromas of nectarine and citrus show a touch of yeasty vanilla, while the palate feels pure and zesty. Orange and pink grapefruit are the key flavors, and the finish is snappy.",Spain,Rosado

"Red fruit aromas are a bit rough and scalped in front of a chunky palate. Charred, burnt, oaky flavors of raspberry and cassis stress ripeness and weight before finishing with buttery oak, a slightly greasy feel and roasted berry flavors. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy notes of porcini mushroom and black olive blend with balsamic plum and cherry aromas. This is a touch heavy and syrupy in feel, and thus creamy flavors of chocolate, plum and berry are not surprising. On the finish, this remains creamy and ripe.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Earthy plum and raspberry aromas are subtle. This is tight on the palate, with firm tannins and slightly elevated acidity. Earthy, lightly toasted raspberry and plum flavors finish dry. As a whole, this is well made and exceeds expectations.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raisin, pastry and plum aromas are smooth and generous given how cool 2013 was in Rioja. There's good acidity and body to go with flavors of plum, blackberry and toasty oak. Finishing notes of coffee, toast and chocolate are fully oaked, which lends a sense of sweetness to this Crianza.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Chunky, oxidized aromas of melon and white stone fruits settle on heavy and bland. There's acidic snap to this Verdejo but also a rubbery feel to the palate. Yeasty flavors of baked apple and peach finish lightly oxidized and almondy.",Spain,Verdejo

"This massive heavily oaked blend of 94% Tinta de Toro and 6% Garnacha smells like a cross between café mocha and a sawmill, with baking spices thrown in for good measure. The palate is rough and tannic, while oaky flavors of clove dominate blackberry fruit. On the finish, more clove is apparent, while the tannic clamp is severe. Drink through 2024.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Saucy berry aromas are accompanied by notes of coffee, olive and forest floor. This has a drawing mouthfeel, while the palate collapses a bit on itself. Flavors of raspberry and cherry offer no small amount of vanilla and oak, while the finish is lively, long and oaky. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Woodsy, cheesy, earthy aromas of berry fruits are a bit hot, jumbled and rooty in style. This is showing a mature, clampy, tannic palate with firm acidity, while earthy flavors of raspberry and plum are lightly baked. This tastes a bit raisiny on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Cherry, plum and raspberry aromas cover the red end of the aromatic spectrum. A wide, tannic, grabby body and earthy flavors of raspberry and baked plum finish bold and choppy, with freshening acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo

"Snappy, dry red-fruit and citrus aromas are a good opening. The palate is fresh and bouncy, with punchy pomegranate and grapefruit flavors. A zesty finish with mild citrus and nectarine flavors is par for the course.",Spain,Rosado
"This smells a touch stalky and leathery, although there's ample black fruit character to the bouquet. A tannic somewhat rough palate holds stalky flavors of roasted black fruits, charred wood and creosote. A jagged finish with peppery spice and heat closes this out. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cherry and plum aromas are dry, earthy and direct. This is a straightforward aged Rioja with grabby tannins but enough body and fruit to absorb them. Baked cherry and plum flavors are a touch rustic and stalky, while a roasted aftertaste sends this on its way. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Charcoal aromas shadow standard black fruit scents. This is forward in its approach, with a sturdy mouthfeel. Black plum and blackberry flavors feature a lot of vanilla and cream, while the finish is mild, straightforward and tastes mostly like oak and associated vanilla. Drink now through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This red-fruit-dominated Garnacha smells of earthy cherry and plum along with orange peel. A racy, chewy, slightly rough palate of pie cherry, red plum, raisin and chocolate finish juicy and aggressive.",Spain,Garnacha

"Black cherry and cassis aromas are bold but basic. This feels fiercely tannic and astringent. Meaty flavors of cherry and black plum end with dried berry notes, prune and rock-hard tannic bite. Give this more time if possible, but like many 2013s it might never soften and improve.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Bright, moderately complex aromas of stone fruits and minerals precede a firm, lemony palate with familiar, highly fresh tangerine and nectarine flavors. This holds its form and snap on the finish. Drink during 2016.",Spain,Albariño
"Certain wines exude a sense of elevated excellence. This one gets to that level via aromas of spice cake, baked plum and tobacco aromas.

Drink through 2040.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of cedar, tobacco and vanilla accent dark-berry scents in front of a palate with edgy tannins and sharp acidity. Blackberry, black cherry, tobacco and vanilla are the key flavors on this good but grating Tempranillo that finishes with oaky flavors of vanilla and tobacco.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe aromas of baked berry fruits and raisin are limited but fine. A plump mouthfeel is pushed by acidic zing, yet overall the palate isn't all that exact in structure. Plum and cassis flavors finish jammy but good.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Clean peach and melon aromas are basic but nice. The texture on this Godello is a bit oily and grabby but good, while tangerine, nectarine and peach flavors finish with some weight but also enough citric acidity to maintain freshness.",Spain,Godello
"Baked raisiny aromas of spice cake are almost overdone. Like many 2009 RDDs, this is huge, tannic and massive as a whole. A woody flavor profile includes earthy jammy berry fruit, while this is heavy with campfire notes on the finish. This is 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon

"Apricot aromas are singular and firmly in control of the bouquet of this Galician blend of 70% Albariño, 15% Loureira and 15% Caiño Blanco. This is juicy and fresh, but low on cushion and leesy framework. Apple and pineapple flavors run quick and finish with minerality and zest.",Spain,White Blend
"Friendly familiar aromas of lees, seashell, lemon, melon and apple set up a shearing pointed palate. Flavors of lemon-lime, green apple and gooseberry are propelled by minerally acidity, while the finish is fresh and well cut.",Spain,Albariño
"Fairly deep berry aromas register as dark and ripe. Following the nose, this feels chunky and round, while toasty blackberry flavors remain heavy and dark on a full generous finish. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The nose on this multigrape blend is gaseous, with forceful berry aromas but little nuance. A tannic, rubbery, rock-hard palate is home to candied black-fruit flavors that are a touch green at the core. Mint and licorice flavors confirm an herbal presence on a brutally tannic finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"This unique Rioja dessert wine can't be judged against anything but itself. It's rusty in color, with aromas of horsehide, sweaty saddle and exotic fruits. The palate is coarse but staunch, while the flavor profile starts with brine and ends with more familiar caramel and toffee. A sweet, syrupy finish is as challenging as it is flavorful. This is a breed unto its own. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromas of vanilla and coconut share space on the nose with ripe notes of blackberry and prune. This feels just fresh enough, with ample body. Ripe berry, raisin and chocolate flavors end a touch flat.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Heavy prune and raisin aromas are perfumed and rich, but arguably a bit overripe. Matching the nose, this feels thick, saturated and grapy. Flavors of black plum and blueberry finish chunky, with muscularity but also a rubbery flavor note.",Spain,Garnacha
"An opaque color is a fair warning of what's to come: namely rubbery minerally black-fruit aromas that scream old vines. In the mouth, this blocky Carignan is flush and shows wall-to-wall saturation. Wild aromas of mountain herbs, blueberry and boysenberry finish sinewy and with spicy minerally black-fruit leftovers. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Carignan
"Cedary, spicy berry aromas are pure Rioja, but this also tosses in campfire, graphite and toast scents. A massive palate is concentrated and needs time to unfold. Flavors of plum, spice cake and pepper finish with a powerful tailwind of chocolate, herbs, spice, berry fruit and acidity. Best from 2020 through 2030.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Cherry, rubber and leather aromas are tight and announce a punchy, bright, raw palate with raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy and rubbery feeling on the finish, this is a fresh Monastrell with red-fruit tendencies.",Spain,Monastrell
"Aromas of radiator dust, lime and green apple are a bit heavy and scattershot. However the palate is tangy and lean, with cutting acidity. Lead flavors of waxy apricot are backed by orange and lime notes, while the finish is dry and waxy, with a yeasty, leesy flavor bolstered by snappy acidity.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Heavily oaked and overtly toasty, this mature, barrel-aged Godello from Bierzo is round, creamy and braced by citric acidity. Resiny, oak-based spice, melon and peach flavors are consistent and lasting on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Godello
"Interesting aromas of mint, Christmas spice, licorice and blackberry feed into a dense, blocky palate with firm acidity. Ripe, loamy flavors of blackberry and prune finish with oak-driven graphite, mint and resiny flavors along with a note of residual cassis. This is half Garnacha and half Carignan.",Spain,Red Blend
"Plum, berry and compost aromas are earthy and a bit herbal. Tight, drawing acidity drives the palate, while minerally plum and berry flavors are sinewy and tough, with raw tannins steering a rugged, staunch finish. Drink this gritty Carignan now through 2018.",Spain,Carignan
"Initial aromas of wet cement, black cherry and cassis grow more rubbery, reduced and animal-driven the longer this Syrah sits around. Bright, fresh and fiercely tannic, this deals dark-berry flavors, peppery spice and raw oak on top of dry, herbal notes. Oaky but not overly charred or pushy on the finish.",Spain,Syrah
"Mild, clean aromas of dusty apple, lees and peach set up a creamy, full palate with low acidity and moderate definition. Papaya and melon are the lead flavors, while the finish is melony and oily, with low acidity and not much, if any, minerality.",Spain,Albariño
"Aromas of hickory, herbs and leather work to accent berry scents on what is a woodsy yet elegant bouquet. Saturated, chewy and tannic, this Rioja tastes of oak, clove and plum fruit, while the finish loses its fruit fast and ends largely with barrel-related notes of resin and toast.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A heavily charred opening emphasizes surface-level oak and baking spices more than fruit. A heavy, jabbing, grabby palate tastes herbal, with stewed berry and prune flavors. A burnt-oak flavor and severe tannins are found on the finish of this muscled-up Tempranillo. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"D. Ventura's 2012s succeed in capturing the elegance of Ribeira Sacra Mencía. This shows aromas of brick dust, spice, tomato, animal fur and dried cherry. The palate is fresh and direct, with punchy raspberry and plum flavors that turn tangy and lean on a quick finish.",Spain,Mencía
"Lifted and floral up front, this Mencía smells like light, schist-infused plum and raspberry. There's mild grab to the palate, which offers flavors of buttery oak, rubber, strawberry and rose hip. A dry, slightly briny tasting finish fades away elegantly.",Spain,Mencía
"Aromas of children's vitamins, corn stalk and white peach set up a lemony stony zesty palate with lemon and nectarine flavors. A stony crisp cleansing finish does the job while not faltering.",Spain,Hondarrabi Zuri
"Loamy berry, cheesy oak, balsamic hints and vanilla notes make for an interesting bouquet. This feels a bit wiry and acidic at its core, while overall it's chunky in stature. Deep warming flavors of kirsch and blackberry finish with heat and jammy weight. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dark in color, this Mencía smells of turned earth, roots, herbs, dried cheese, tobacco and baked black fruits. It's round and chunky on the palate, but cobbled together at its foundation. Ripe blackberry and raspberry flavors come with vanilla and creamy notes in front of an ephemeral finish. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Mencía
"Snappy citric aromas of grapefruit and lime are pungent and not too different from Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. Accordingly, the palate is fresh and focused, with flavors of stone fruits that are leesy and have a honeyed sweetness. A controlled, mild finish tastes mostly of orange. Drink now.",Spain,Godello
"Layered aromas of blackberry, cassis, leather and dried cheese are inviting. In the mouth, this Garnacha from vines more than 100-years-old is jammy and friendly. Candied almost syrupy flavors of blackberry and black cherry finish dense and chocolaty, with modest acidity. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Garnacha
"The first take on this Rioja Reserva is of charred wood, then that's backed up by piercing aromas of cherry and plum. This feels hard and abrasive, but powerful. Flavors of roasted plum, tomato and herbs finish with grating tannins and a lemony oak flavor.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raspberry and cherry aromas are juicy and wiry, with no fat at all. Pure, simple berry flavors come with a touch of spice, while the finish is short yet juicy. An easy-drinking and approachable selection.",Spain,Tempranillo

"Mild, clean aromas of dusty apple, lees and peach set up a creamy, full palate with low acidity and moderate definition. Papaya and melon are the lead flavors, while the finish is melony and oily, with low acidity and not much, if any, minerality.",Spain,Albariño
"Gritty, tarry plum and raspberry aromas are firm and good. This feels wide, fleshy and tomatoey. Plum, raspberry and currant flavors turn more oaky and toasty as they open, while the finish is lightly herbal and peppery in flavor, with zesty acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Savory, slightly saucy aromas of plum, berry, tomato and leather come with a hint of oak. This is a bit choppy and tannic, with savory, roasted flavors of tomato, plum, currant and spice. A touch of saltiness and raw-oak flavor rise up on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dry yeasty aromas control the nose on this moderately sophisticated rosé that's made entirely from Trepat. In the mouth, this is solid but not thick. Dry peach and nectarine flavors are clean and finish with just enough girth to chew on.",Spain,Trepat
"Mild comfortable aromas of burnt orange and spiced pumpkin lead to a tight, focused palate of moderate weight. Dry melon and peach aromas are on the money, while this finishes clean as polished glass, with a touch of spice.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Oaky aromas of maple, blackberry and chimney grit set up a raw tannic palate. This tastes toasty and oaky, but with enough black-fruit flavor to support all that wood. Mild herb and spice flavors mix with tea and berry notes on the finish of this off-vintage Tempranillo. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Papaya and stone-fruit aromas are fleshy and a touch green and grassy, giving way to dustiness upon airing. This feels spritzy and good, with a full complement of golden apple, white grape and green plum flavors. Solid, stony and minerally on the finish, with a hint of tropical fruit flavor.",Spain,Hondarrabi Zuri
"Fresh cherry and plum aromas are a bit scratchy but alert. This feels firm, with bright acidity creating a raw sense on the palate. Plum, berry and a pinch of saltiness make for an authentic flavor profile, while this finishes long and steady. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend

"Typical for basic Rioja, this is violet in color, with fresh plum and red berry aromas. The palate comes across kind of hard, tight and candied, with sweet berry fruit flavors that turn bitter on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Plum and red-berry aromas are clean and fresh. This skips along on the palate, while flavors of wild berry and plum are a touch raw in character and feel. A rubbery finish is fresh and turns mildly bitter once the fruit fades.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe blackberry aromas are a touch malty and jammy, with a note of buttered pastry thrown in for good measure. This emphasizes the rich ripe extracted side of Priorat, but balance is not sacrificed. Lush dark toasty black-fruit flavors come with notes of oaky spice and bitter chocolate, while the finish is toasty blackened, deep and chunky. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Red Blend
"Tan in color and in the early stages of fading, this smells reserved, with aromas of turpentine, popcorn and bread. Rubbery and slightly pinched in feel, this tastes briny, nutty and melony, with plenty of oak in support. A lighlty oaked finish is short in length and complexity. Drink now.",Spain,White Blend
"Aromas of raspberry jam are a bit stretched out and unusual for a Rioja. In the mouth, this is fresh and fruity, but a bit light on substance. Savory red-fruit flavors end comfortably, with a good texture.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Rubbery cherry and berry aromas feed into a forward, chewy palate with raw, spicy flavors of plum offset by oaky vanilla and some bitterness. A fresh, angular finish is braced by snappy acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lime and mineral aromas drive the nose on this fairly full-bodied brut nature from a warm vintage. On the palate, this is balanced, with bubbles absorbed into the wine's fabric. Up-front salty notes are backed by briny apple, nectarine and yeasty flavors, while this is sophisticated and fairly complex on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Yeasty, bready aromas lack the citric kick and minerality that top Rueda whites deliver in spades. The palate is dilute but slightly creamy, while yeasty flavors are low on fruit and finish with a note of gardenia flower.",Spain,Verdejo
"This opens with scratchy, slightly dirty aromas of blueberry and blackberry. The palate is heavy and jammy, but also somewhat raw and abrasive. Cherry and plum flavors are basic, while an inoffensive finish falls off quickly.",Spain,Red Blend

"Dusty, scratchy, spicy red-fruit aromas register as feral. This is wiry and medicinal in feel, with spicy black-plum flavors that are brash and oaky. Peppery spice dominates an otherwise hollow finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"Apple and pear aromas provide a smooth entry to a round, slightly creamy palate. Grapefruit, green-herb, pear and apple flavors lean toward sweet and ripe, while the finish holds onto just enough acidic zest.",Spain,Verdejo
"Zesty cherry aromas are offset by powdery softness and floral hints. This feels solid and correct, with bright acidity. Flavors of red-apple skins and citrus fruits finish direct and clean.",Spain,Rosado
"Papaya and stone-fruit aromas are fleshy and a touch green and grassy, giving way to dustiness upon airing. This feels spritzy and good, with a full complement of golden apple, white grape and green plum flavors. Solid, stony and minerally on the finish, with a hint of tropical fruit flavor.",Spain,Hondarrabi Zuri
"Fresh cherry and plum aromas are a bit scratchy but alert. This feels firm, with bright acidity creating a raw sense on the palate. Plum, berry and a pinch of saltiness make for an authentic flavor profile, while this finishes long and steady. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Rubbery, earthy aromas of berry fruits, plum and mushroom are solid but nondescript. This feels grabby and pinchy, with herbal, leafy, salty flavors that end with loamy plum and prune notes. Overall, this is big and forceful. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Red Blend

"Concentrated berry aromas are basic and hint at sugar beets. This feels jammy and a bit syrupy, while robust berry, beet and chocolate flavors finish a touch heavy and sticky. For the money, this is generous and plenty good.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Full, pushy aromas of stewed plum, tomato, herbs and heavy oak come in front of a high-acid palate with salty flavors of herbal red plum, oregano, basil and tomato. A saline character sits heavily on the wine's chunky finish.",Spain,Red Blend

"This purple-tinted Carignan is a concentrated number with familiar varietal and regional aromas of latex, graphite, schist, tire rubber and black fruits. In the mouth, this is chewy and full bodied, but not heavy. Oaky spicy blackberry and nutmeg flavors linger on a mildly woody, extracted and gritty finish. Best to give this a few more years so drink through 2022.",Spain,Carignan
"Ripe black-fruit aromas are cuddly and reflect the warm conditions of 2012. Tight and ribbed on the palate, this has the structure to handle blackberry, chocolate and peppery spice flavors without seeming overripe or jammy. A saturated finish benefits from the right amount of acidity. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Mencía
"Rooty, nutty aromas of stewed fruits are almost baked out. On the palate, this rallies to show muscle and shape. Flavors of dried cherry, plum and raisin feature notes of caramel and spice. On the finish, this is mild and on cruise control. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Spicy, minty aromas of dried herbs and modest red fruits are stony and dry. This is a juicy, agile Mencía with flavors of dry oak, spice, red currant and plum. A clean, clear, stony finish is light, bright and punchy.",Spain,Mencía
"It has been a while since we've reviewed Cuatro Pasos, but eight vintages later it's basically the same wine, which, for the price, means good value. This opens with earthy warm muddled berry aromas. The palate is flush and plump, reflective of a hot vintage, while blackberry and cassis flavors finish hefty. Drink now.",Spain,Mencía
"Blackberry, brandied cherry and spice aromas lead to a wide palate with tannins that pierce like nails. This tastes a touch foxy and wild, while the finish feels centered and firm. Despite intense, abrasive tannins, this displays depth and complexity. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tinta de Toro

"Baked berry and cherry aromas are ripe and come with accents of mocha, leather and caramel. This feels full but not heavy, with balance and cushion to the palate. Spiced black-fruit flavors show a tea-like note, while this is dry, spicy and a touch chocolaty on the finish. Drink through 2026.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy plum and currant aromas are light on complexity. This blend is crisp, fresh and ultimately modest in feel, with black cherry and plum flavors. A clean finish makes it good for everyday drinking.",Spain,Red Blend
"Lightly herbal aromas and a touch of animal blend with oak-based notes of sweet plastic and vanilla on the nose. The palate is round but slightly flabby, with moderate acidity. Lactic oak creates a plastic-like flavor that is derivative of the nose, while the finish is drab.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Plump melon and stone fruit aromas are a touch broken down and mealy. This Godello feels fleshy and round, with pulpy weight. Tangerine and tropical fruit flavors weigh in on the heavy side, while the finish is chunky and pithy in flavor.",Spain,Godello
"Earthy, syrupy aromas come with a spot of green and a touch of earthy mulch. This is bulky and flabby in feel as it struggles for balance. Thick berry flavors are matched by green, herbal, mossy notes, while the finish is chewy in feel and baked in flavor.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This blends nutty notes with aromas of chemical and saline. The palate is tight, sharp and citric, while flavors of briny apricot come with bitter as well as nutty notes. A dry, salty finish feels angular and sharp.",Spain,Sherry
"Ripe, oaky and showing aromas of coconut, vanilla, raisin and prune, this easily approachable Monastrell is full, dark and stretched wide, with proper acidity keeping things fenced in and focused. Sun-baked black-fruit flavors finish spicy and peppery, with mild heat.",Spain,Monastrell
"Baked plum, brick dust, stewed tomato and leather aromas are rugged but good. Chewy and only moderately tannic, this basic Monastrell delivers raspberry and plum flavors sweetened by hints of brown sugar and molasses. A lasting, chocolaty finish is easygoing, with a shot of acidity for balance.",Spain,Monastrell
"Although this Garnacha Blanca shows rustic, cidery aromas, it displays a balanced, layered, round palate with vital acidity. Salty, savory peach and apple flavors are true to white Garnacha, while a long, salty finish is full of energy.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Hints of jalapeño and bell pepper run alongside lime and apple aromas, while this feels secure. Lemon, apple and a dash of briny salt fill out the flavor profile, while this finishes similarly, with firm acidity.",Spain,Verdejo
"This dark, very ripe Crianza smells extracted, jammy and slightly soupy, with aromas of raisin, pipe tobacco and blackberry. The palate is heavy and a touch hollow, with baked berry, vanilla, licorice and resiny flavors. An oak-based finish tastes ripe, succulent and like mocha.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This purple-tinted Carignan is a concentrated number with familiar varietal and regional aromas of latex, graphite, schist, tire rubber and black fruits. In the mouth, this is chewy and full bodied, but not heavy. Oaky spicy blackberry and nutmeg flavors linger on a mildly woody, extracted and gritty finish. Best to give this a few more years so drink through 2022.",Spain,Carignan
"With a light salmon color and aromas of citrus, apple, spiced pumpkin and minerals, this is tangy and citrusy on the palate, with flavors of orange and pink grapefruit. A fresh, solidly composed finish provides for a healthy conclusion.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Cherry and watermelon aromas are fair and easy, while raspberry and plum-skin flavors finish pithy and citrusy.",Spain,Rosado
"Minerally red-berry aromas suggest vitamins and latex. Like most RDD jovens, this is raw and rubbery in feel, with high-intensity plum and berry flavors. A loud, acidic finish is fresh as can be but entirely simple in terms of complexity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe aromas of baked berry and raisin stop short of being too ripe. In the mouth, this basic Tempranillo is chunky but balanced by fresh acids. Plum, prune and spice flavors finish loamy and plump. Good wine for $8.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean, fresh and inviting aromas are simple as rosé should be. Plum, raspberry and other red-fruit flavors are full and tight, with ripeness, acidity and just a hint of sweetness.",Spain,Rosado
"Apple and stone-fruit aromas are a little oily and starting to fade. Driving acidity keeps this in forward mode, but there's an empty gap in the middle of the palate. Waxy apple, apricot and orange flavors finish just juicy enough. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"Leesy fleshy papaya aromas come with a touch of sulfur and harshness. This feels solid, albeit modest in bubbles. Flavors of apple and green melon are lasting and steady on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Waxy aromas of lanolin, dried apple and cheese set up a plump well-balanced palate, with plenty of body weight and adequate acidity. Peach, apple and melon flavors are moderately stony and minerally, while this varietal Garnacha Blanca finishes with good length.",Spain,Grenache Blanc
"Aromas of orange peel and orange essence are oily and bring softer notes of melon, apple and tropical fruits. This is bright but basic on the tongue, with cutting acidity. Tropical flavors of green melon and mango are ratcheted by citric acidity, while the finish is citrusy and pithy.",Spain,Albariño
"Apple and peach aromas are clean and pure. This feels round yet compact, with orange, nectarine and pithy flavors. Green-apple tartness and malic acidity push a pure finish that doesn't balk.",Spain,Hondarrabi Zuri
"Rustic leathery aromas are capped and low on vibrant fruit scents. In the mouth, expect tannic scratchiness. Flavors of plum, cassis and toasty oak come across as mildly baked, while a narrow finish with notes of earth, loam and chocolate is solid. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raisin and prune aromas indicate full ripeness, while jammy fig notes come in later and confirm this wine's warm-vintage DNA. A clampy palate with big tannins offers inky flavors of plum and prune, while an oaky concentrated finish feels jammy. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pithy citrus aromas are heavy and strangely herbal for a white wine. Pulpy and wide in feel, with little midpalate structure, this tastes of citrus rind, white grapefruit and nopal. A zesty note reprises on the finish.",Spain,Godello
"Leathery, clipped, briary black-fruit aromas are heavily oaked and smoky. This feels like a bag of nails, with a sucking texture. Barrel-heavy flavors of charred blackberry and cassis are resiny and dry, with clove notes and pounding tannins. Hold as long as you wish; this can only benefit from more time in the bottle.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Clean, fresh and inviting aromas are simple as rosé should be. Plum, raspberry and other red-fruit flavors are full and tight, with ripeness, acidity and just a hint of sweetness.",Spain,Rosado
"This is a very ripe and raisiny specimen from a rocky vintage. It's chunky and somewhat grating in the mouth, with balance issues. Prune, raisin and chocolate flavors finish without much structure or spine. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Stony aromas of minerally citrus and nectarine are clean and upright. This Garnacha rosé is simple but good in feel, with generic but clean flavors of stone fruits. Bitter, pithy flavors rise up to dominate the finish.",Spain,Rosé
"Leathery olive aromas are not overly ripe or fruity. This is Graciano, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon from southerly Cádiz, and it's tight and narrow in mouthfeel, with roasted, stalky berry flavors. A full, grabby finish tastes more savory and spicy than fruity.",Spain,Red Blend
"Oaky aromas of milk chocolate and animal sit atop plum and cherry scents. This is a direct wine without a lot of nuance or layering: flavors of red plum and cherry are crisp and benefit from chocolaty oak, while the finish is solid in feel and tastes of oak and briny plum.",Spain,Red Blend
"Briny cidery aromas are fortunately not that loud or intense. This is wide and generous on the palate, with dry briny stone-fruit and apple flavors. A sense of dryness and pickle brine is amplified on a purposeful finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Wood resin, green melon and a slight whiff of gasoline comprise the nose on this fresh refined manzanilla. Spiced apple, sea salt and sautéed white mushroom flavors are lasting on a healthy semicomplex finish.",Spain,Sherry
"Raspberry and red-plum aromas are floral and fresh, but simple. This has a hard, almost metallic mouthfeel and red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry. A wiry, short finish is raw and snappy in feel, with a hint of oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Red plum and currant aromas are a touch soupy but also suggestive of cherry Kool-Aid. This Garnacha-led blend is clacky and fairly acidic on the palate, but then it turns on itself to show raisin, loam and baked plum flavors. A lively finish gives it a boost out the door.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rustic leathery aromas are capped and low on vibrant fruit scents. In the mouth, expect tannic scratchiness. Flavors of plum, cassis and toasty oak come across as mildly baked, while a narrow finish with notes of earth, loam and chocolate is solid. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raisin and prune aromas indicate full ripeness, while jammy fig notes come in later and confirm this wine's warm-vintage DNA. A clampy palate with big tannins offers inky flavors of plum and prune, while an oaky concentrated finish feels jammy. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Red Blend
"Leesy white fruit aromas open this blend of 80% Albariño with Loureiro and Treixadura. In the mouth, it's all citric acidity and stoniness. The body doesn't register. Flavors of blood orange and lemon are also minerally, while the finish is persistently linear.",Spain,White Blend
"Leathery stalky berry aromas come across as being baked and rough. This is full and grabby on the palate with cooked blackberry and prune flavors that end dark, and spicy with notes of licorice and herbs.",Spain,Red Blend
"Despite opening with a yellow color and waxy oily peach aromas, this benefits from zesty lemon-like acidity. Flavors of quince and apple are oaky, while effusive acidity keeps this Verdejo fresh on the finish, which is otherwise big and full. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"Simple cherry and plum aromas lead to a modest palate with little substance to it. Short bursts of red-fruit flavors are as basic as can be, while the finish is hollow but raw in feel.",Spain,Red Blend
"Can't-miss aromas of petrol, wet stones and lime will have you thinking this is Riesling, but the blend is two-thirds Garnacha Blanca and the rest Macabeo. Tight and well cut on the palate, this tastes of melon, lime and peach pit. A quick, lean finish works.",Spain,White Blend
"Standard red-berry, rubber and spice aromas are straightforward. This is active on the palate, with pinching tannins, snappy acidity and rawness. Tomato, dry oak, currant, red plum and dusty spice flavors finish with firm tannins and moderate heat and burn.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe plum and berry aromas share the nose with heavy oak notes. This Tempranillo feels dry and tannic, while initially it tastes mostly like sawdust and oak. Deep digging and patience reveal briary berry and salty notes amid a lot of wood.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Briny, dusty, bready aromas set up a lively but foamy palate. Soda cracker, briny citrus and dried apricot flavors finish salty, pickled and dry, with hints of leftover citrus and green herbs.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Red-fruit and citrus aromas create an astringent sensation on the nose. In the mouth, this is rather dilute and wiry in feel. Flavors of cranberry, pie cherry and orange peel finish herbal and lean.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Oxidized aromas of vanilla and butterscotch are not terribly enticing or fresh. This chunky Verdejo is round and peachy, with oxidized, leesy flavors of melon and peach. It's flabby on the finish, with no structure.",Spain,Verdejo
"Aromas of forced oak and milk chocolate come across as pasty and unnatural. An abrasive, choppy mouthfeel and oaky flavors of creamy berry fruits are adequate at best. This feels scratchy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of canned peaches and children's vitamins lack appeal. This feels fleshy and far from precise, with a mix of oxidized white-fruit and bitter flavors that leads to a mealy finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Vague cherry and raspberry aromas come with notes of arugula and bell pepper. The palate is adequate but faltering, while flavors of raspberry show a note of jalapeño. The finish feels decent, with flavors that reflect all that came before it.",Spain,Rosé
"Wiry, narrow aromas of red fruits and bell pepper lead to a grabby, tight palate. Flavors of spicy plum and green herbs are slightly bitter, while the finish feels raw and tannic.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dusty, candied aromas of raspberry and stone fruits aren't all that fresh or defined. This has a grabby, citric feel and briny red-fruit flavors that are echoed on a full, chunky finish.",Spain,Rosado
"Stalky aromas are dry and suggestive of animal hide. A level mouthfeel and elastic tannins allow for earthy, floral raspberry and plum flavors to do well despite a weedy element. Floral notes and herbal flavors mark the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This brawny, heavy Monastrell opens with sketchy, murky aromas of stewed, herbal berry fruits, while the palate is oaky and resiny. Baked, burnt berry flavors mixed with heavy doses of hickory and clove finish bitter and outright woody.",Spain,Monastrell
"Dense, roasted, earthy aromas start with tomato and fall off to raisiny and overripe. A chunky, flabbby, raisiny palate follows suit, while raisin and fruit-cake flavors maintain this wine's soft, overripe character.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Creamy oak aromas shout “vanilla” and “wood resin” in full voice. This is a rough wine with stampeding tannins. Toasty boysenberry flavors are more pounding than elegant, while this tastes of bitter chocolate on an aggressive finish. Give this five years and it may show better but now it's massive and unsettled.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe dense aromas of blackberry and cassis border on prune and raisin but pull back. A compact saturated palate is held together by hard, pounding tannins, while grapy black-fruit flavors show a chocolaty note of fudge. A condensed tannic finish is heavy and feels a bit overextracted.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Can't-miss aromas of petrol, wet stones and lime will have you thinking this is Riesling, but the blend is two-thirds Garnacha Blanca and the rest Macabeo. Tight and well cut on the palate, this tastes of melon, lime and peach pit. A quick, lean finish works.",Spain,White Blend
"Despite showing ripe, raisiny aromas, this is solid in the mouth, with adequate acidity. Earthy flavors of blackberry and plum are straightforward and basic, while the finish hums along with a mild raisiny flavor.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of stewed berry, coffee grinds and compost are less than appealing, although with airing things improve. This is wide and blocky in the mouth, with ripe, raisiny, roasted black-fruit flavors matched by bitter espresso. Molasses and heat drive the finish on this pricey wine that's not in great shape.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Aromas of cherry cough drops and huckleberry syrup are heady and perplexing. The palate is like cough medicine, while syrupy cherry and berry flavors transition to medicinal and chocolaty. A rich, flabby finish is just more fuel for a unique but challenged fire.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stalky, short aromas suggest that this is raw and underripe. The palate feel confirms that impression; it's tight and choppy, with drying tannins. Roasted, gritty flavors of red fruits come with a sprinkle of cocoa, while the finish is tough in feel, spicy and ultimately mildly bitter.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of chewing gum dust, lime and wet stones are simple and clean. This Viura is equally light and citrusy on the palate, with moderately briny flavors of lime and white grapefruit. A mild palate doesn't bring anything new to the game.",Spain,Viura
"Cherry, raspberry and spicy oak aromas open this chunky, standard Rioja. Roasted plum and currant flavors turn more oaky on the back side, while the finish feels fresh and tastes lightly spicy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dry, earthy aromas of cherry and tree bark set up a juicy, pointed, drawing palate. Plum, cherry and currant flavors are zesty and pushed by raw acidity, while the finish is aggressive and racy. 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Oaky aromas of maple and molasses are overriding and ponderous. In the mouth, this is tannic and punishing. Flavors of coconut and chocolate are overly dominant, leaving nothing but candied stickiness and wood resin on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Syrupy red-berry and cherry aromas are medicinal, while the mouthfeel on this blend is hard and abrasive. Berry and herbal flavors are on the sour side, while the finish does nothing to bring this around.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"Grassy aromas mix with whiffs of red licorice candy and cinnamon to create an odd nose. Hard on the palate, this blend tastes of rubbery plum and pepper, with a minty, green finish closing it out.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Funky aromas of gumdrop and stale fruit are none too appealing. This lacks definition on the palate, while flavors of melon, candied berry and cotton candy are muddled. The finish lacks crispness.",Spain,Rosé
"Raspberry and plum aromas lead to a jammy, pruny palate with no structure. Prune, raisin and carob flavors finish flaccid and not fresh.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Focused crisp aromas of white fruits reflect a cool vintage. This is roughly one-quarter each Macabeo, Parellada, Xarello and Chardonnay, and it feels tight, fresh and focused. Dry stone-fruit flavors include a hint of lime, while this is clean on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Rubbery aromas of pencil eraser, raisin, blueberry and red bell pepper are good but not at the highest level. Chalky and abrupt in feel, this is good on the palate but lacking a bit in flow. Medicinal red-berry flavors finish with sandpaper tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Choppy, stalky red-berry aromas shows a modest green note and a reedy quality. Although raw in feel, this offers a solid mix of plum and stalky berry flavors. A dry, peppery, oaky finish tastes as if the grapes struggled to get fully ripe in what was a cold vintage throughout Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Familiar berry aromas blend with hard spice notes and a hint of blueberry. Like many 2013s, this is showing a clamped-down mouthfeel along with flavors of peppery black fruits. A limited finish is hard and compact. Drink or hold for another five or more years; this isn't going anywhere.",Spain,Tempranillo
Stone fruit and slightly funky yet natural aromas get this organic and biodynamic varietal Xarello off to a good start. A standard mouthfeel along with apple and banana flavors finish clean but nothing more. From 67-year-old vines.,Spain,Xarel-lo
"Aromas of cola nut, bacon, blackberry, licorice and wood smoke announce a raw rugged palate that's not nearly as plump and lush as it normally is: a clear reflection of the cool 2013 vintage in Rioja. Dry peppery black-fruit flavors finish with toasty oak and licorice notes. Although rough and rugged now, this should improve little by little through about 2030.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This blend of Mencía, the local Grand Noir and Merenzao opens with raisiny, spicy, slightly baked aromas that suggest nutmeg. The palate is drawing and hard, with earthy, slightly cooked flavors of cherry and kirsch that end with a dash of lemony oak.",Spain,Red Blend
"Earthy berry and leather aromas are fairly quiet. A more lively palate offers good weight and overall composition, while plum, raspberry and spice flavors finish with sweeter notes of raisin and baked berry.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smoky oak and hickory aromas are gaseous early on but come with ripe notes of raisin and plum. This Tempranillo-led blend feels round and grabby, but a touch hollow. Flavors of cherry, plum and chocolate are lightly oaked and finish with grabby tannins and modest earthy complexity.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of waffles and corn flakes suggest maturity and complexity. This feels open and wide, with depth to the palate. Direct flavors of lime and tangerine finish more citric and minerally than the nose, with a lasting sense of freshness.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of citrus, especially white grapefruit and lime, are spunky and sweaty like Sauvignon Blanc or Verdejo. A solid, fleshy palate is home to a mix of citric and tropical flavors, while the finish reverts back to grapefruit, with a monotone feel. This is Macabeo, Garnacha Blanca and Pedro Ximénez.",Spain,White Blend
"Dark plum and berry aromas are fairly full and concentrated, with a boost from spicy oak. A medium-bodied palate offers up tannic rub, while cherry, black plum and oak-based spice flavors finish creamy, dry and spicy, with a hint of tobacco along with mild heat.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy aromas of raspberry and plum are familiar for Rioja. This feels fresh but also full and meaty. Balsamic raspberry and plum flavors finish warm, with chocolaty notes and a sense of competence and quality.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Oaky aromas of raspberry and currant come with notes of animal fur, lemon peel and shoe polish. This feels lively and not too heavy, with pointy, almost lemony raspberry and plum flavors that finish herbal, dry, medicinal and oaky. Drink this fresh, wiry Rioja through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Brambly, lightly herbal aromas of berry fruit, sugar beet and a touch of chemical precede a wiry, narrow palate with briary flavors of herbal berry and cassis. A tannic, crimped finish is rugged and houses cherry flavors and heat.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This is hard-hitting, rumble-ready Rioja with raw, minty aromas coming in front of a packed, drying palate. Powerful berry flavors finish with a peppery flavor, rubbery notes and sharpness. This may improve some over the next two years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Initial aromas are suggestive of turpentine and alcohol, but with time things improve. This is chunky and low on pulse; flavors of tomato, green herbs and red fruits are marginal, while the finish carries some burn and heat.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Stony, minerally aromas of green apple and lemon are clean and focused. The palate follows that lead, showing minerally crispness along with firm but not cutting acidity. Apple, pear and peach flavors finish glassy and fresh.",Spain,Godello
"This blend of Mencía, the local Grand Noir and Merenzao opens with raisiny, spicy, slightly baked aromas that suggest nutmeg. The palate is drawing and hard, with earthy, slightly cooked flavors of cherry and kirsch that end with a dash of lemony oak.",Spain,Red Blend
"Earthy berry and leather aromas are fairly quiet. A more lively palate offers good weight and overall composition, while plum, raspberry and spice flavors finish with sweeter notes of raisin and baked berry.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smoky oak and hickory aromas are gaseous early on but come with ripe notes of raisin and plum. This Tempranillo-led blend feels round and grabby, but a touch hollow. Flavors of cherry, plum and chocolate are lightly oaked and finish with grabby tannins and modest earthy complexity.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of waffles and corn flakes suggest maturity and complexity. This feels open and wide, with depth to the palate. Direct flavors of lime and tangerine finish more citric and minerally than the nose, with a lasting sense of freshness.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Earthy aromas of brick dust blend with spiced cherry and tomato notes. A chewy, solid palate registers as correct, while this tastes of ripe, candied berry fruits and chocolate. A long, warm, slightly oaky finish sends this on its way.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Composed cherry, cassis, tobacco and oak aromas are elegant and on the spot. This is alert on the palate, with bold acidity and moderate tannins. Lightly herbal plum and cherry aromas are earthy and leafy but not green. A rugged-feeling herbal finish suggests Cabernet Franc, but this is 100% Cab Sauvignon.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Red plum, raspberry and dusty aromas are solid and clean. This has citric acidity that props up the palate. Generic flavors of citrus and nectarine finish with a distant note of red plum and red currant.",Spain,Rosado
"Baked notes of raisin and raspberry blend with earthy, leathery, horsey scents on this jammy Rioja that is mildly tannic in feel. Short, simple, lightly baked flavors of plum and prune finish loamy and a bit lazy.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Initial aromas of gasoline give way to briny scents of sauerkraut and cider. This is juicy on the palate, with a medium-intense bubble bead. Briny citrus, green-apple and green-herb flavors finish with length and notes of pickle brine, dust and white pepper.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Mellow peach and nectarine aromas come with a dusting of talcum powder. On the palate, this is citric and lemony, while a jumble of orange and stone-fruit flavors finish clean and crisp. Overall this is fine but undistinguished.",Spain,Rosado
"Dusty peach, nectarine and chewing gum aromas are clean and standard. A lively palate shows bright but controlled acidity and citrusy notes. Stone-fruit and red-plum flavors finish mild. Drink this year.",Spain,Rosé
"Yeasty bready aromas are more smooth and leesy than fruity. This has a round palate that's full but not creamy due to firm acidity. Melon, peach and vanilla flavors finish yeasty and dry, with moderate complexity. This is made entirely from Pinot Noir.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
Dense blackberry and cassis aromas show a hint of leather. This saturated jam-packed blend of Monastrell and several other red grapes tastes of chocolaty oak and baked plum and berries. A chunky finish doesn't show much evolution.,Spain,Red Blend
"By nature Albariño doesn't last long, and this is well past its prime. Chunky, mealy, soft aromas announce a fleshy, low-pulse palate with mealy peach flavors and no finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Gorgeous aromas of toasty oak, wood smoke, minerals and layered black fruits feed into a concentrated, thick palate that demands a knife and fork for dissection. Flavors of toast, vanilla bean, woodspice, bacon, mint and blackberry are lush. Give this beauty another couple of years, then drink through 2022.",Spain,Tinto Fino
Jammy aromas of blackberry and cassis start out gaseous and muddled but find their way with airing. This feels wide and low on zest. Flavors of prune and stewed berry end with toasty oak but also heavy ripe prune and berry flavors. Drink now.,Spain,Mencía
"Initial aromas are suggestive of turpentine and alcohol, but with time things improve. This is chunky and low on pulse; flavors of tomato, green herbs and red fruits are marginal, while the finish carries some burn and heat.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Sweet, floral aromas of plum, candied berry and sugar beet are friendlier than the palate, which is a bit piercing and high in acidity. Cherry and tart plum flavors finish with choppy, bright acids and citric flavors.",Spain,Garnacha
"From the starting gun, this is a raisiny, candied wine with complexity issues. The palate is tannic and not the least bit varied; basically it just sits there. Flavors of raisin and red licorice finish sweet, medicinal and with a note of green peppercorn. This is flavorful but blocky and strange.",Spain,Red Blend
"Ripe blueberry, black plum and violet aromas are sweet and ripe. This is a chunky, flat feeling Tempranillo with candied, soft blackberry and other black-fruit flavors. A short, simple finish fits this heavy wine's overall profile.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Leathery plum and berry aromas come with a touch of char. This blend of Shiraz and Tempranillo feels round and solid. Familiar flavors of berry fruits and cherry are a bit spicy, while the finish tastes of black fruits and feels right.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Apple and peach aromas are basic but clean and fresh. So is the palate on this Chardonnay-Sauvignon Blanc blend. Flavors of nectarine and apple don't stray far from basic, while green apple and citrus flavors are propped up on the finish by racy acidity.",Spain,Chardonnay-Sauvignon Blanc
"Edgy cherry and currant aromas are more crisp than rich, while this old-vines Rioja also shows an aromatic note of dusty earth. High acidity tethered to a medium body creates some midpalate emptiness, while plum, currant and berry flavors are fresh on a pointy finish. Drink through 2024.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe berry fruit and gritty oak aromas lead to a full-bodied blocky palate with grating tannins. This is a heavily oaked blend of Syrah, Tempranillo and Merlot. Flavors of blackberry, vanilla and wood spice finish with barrel char and depth. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Red Blend
"Textbook Duero Valley aromas of licorice root, cola, peppery spice, blackberry and vanilla are complete and cover all the bases. While this is medium to full in body and weight, it is racy due to pulsing acidity. Flavors of toasty oak and vanilla are compatible with tart berry and plum fruit, while this is lithe and bolstered by acidity on the finish. Drink through 2027.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Baked, earthy aromas of vanilla and raisin suggest a ripe wine with an overt oak character. A shearing, tannic palate is an enamel-peeler, while this tastes of wiry plum and blackberry. On the finish it settles a bit, leaving spicy notes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Roasted, smoky, earthy aromas of herbal berry fruits and leather stir interest. In the mouth, this Tempranillo is firm and chewy, with full tannins. Savory, spicy and baked in flavor, this basic Penedès red finishes dry, peppery and with leathery berry notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A mild bouquet of generic stone-fruit aromas is a touch empty but friendly. This is mild on the palate, with modest acidity and not much minerally kick. Briny, leesy nectarine flavors finish round in feel. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"Graphite, maple and other oaky aromas dominate this lush, pitch-black Tinto Fino. A chewy, dense mouthfeel is rich as an oil baron, while oak-driven flavors of vanilla and baking spices accent blackberry and cassis.

"Oaky aromas of raspberry and currant come with notes of animal fur, lemon peel and shoe polish. This feels lively and not too heavy, with pointy, almost lemony raspberry and plum flavors that finish herbal, dry, medicinal and oaky. Drink this fresh, wiry Rioja through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Emeritus is a blend of 83% Cabernet Sauvignon with Petit Verdot and Syrah filling out the form. Dense earthy aromas of blackberry come with a note of graphite, while the oak on this bruiser smells a bit cheesy. Pounding blackberry and chocolate-cake flavors finish oaky, toasty, baked and incredibly ripe. Drink this massive wine through 2023.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"A wiry, fresh, slightly briny smelling nose sets up a pointed, zesty palate with electric, high-strung flavors of red plum and wild berry. The finish is hard, juicy and a little hot and fiery.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Peach and apple aromas are soft and easy, maybe even a touch cidery. Overall, this is a standard but well-made Albariño, with flavors of nectarine and cider. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"Minty, earthy aromas suggest Christmas spice and fruit cake. This is saturated but a bit soupy and drying. Flavors of prune, plum, raisin and spices are a touch stewed, while this finishes ripe but short on freshness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Gritty tarry slightly gaseous aromas of jammy black fruits are a bit less than precise. This feels flush but soft around the edges. Blackened berry and black-plum flavors are lightly charred and chocolaty, while this tastes of black pepper and shows some heat on the finish. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tinta Fina
"Nectarine and white-flower aromas are young and pulsing. This Viura feels fresh and elegant, with grip and weight. Oak-driven flavors are controlled and sit atop a white-fruit base, while this finishes clean and easy, with finesse.",Spain,Viura
"Passion fruit and citrus aromas are straightforward and a bit sharp. This feels lemony yet wan, with tangy, lean flavors of lemon-lime mixed with fresh green herbs. Notes of scallion and tarragon blend with lingering lime on the finish.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Spunky, lively cherry, plum and currant aromas come with a whiff of rubber and Band-Aid. This blend of Tempranillo, Carignan and Grenache is dainty, with mid-level intensity. Oaky, medicinal plum and raspberry flavors run lean and herbal on the finish, and overall this is a light-framed red that's mild in character.",Spain,Red Blend
"No two ways about this, it's stalky and earthy on the nose, with mulchy, herbal notes. This feels pinchy and tannic, with roasted red-berry flavors that finish extremely earthy. Good mouthfeel and textural balance are saving graces.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This mature Tempranillo shows aromas of fig and sherry vinegar along with raisin. A ripe yet pinched feeling palate deals aged flavors of raisin, caramel and toffee, while a chocolaty finish is low on vital fruit. This gran reserva exhibits multiple sherry-like characteristics.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of tomato, spiced cherry, leather and fresh herbs are clean and appealing. A standard, balanced mouthfeel is medium in body, with dry, woody flavors of peppery plum and berry fruits. Minty and darker on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is funky up front, with aromas of Russian dressing and briny citrus. The mouthfeel is chunky and foamy, while the flavor profile runs heavy and sweet, with candied citrus and molasses notes. A weighty finish tastes of brown sugar.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Black in color and inky on the nose, this ultra-concentrated, superripe Tempranillo is smoky and toasty, with accents of graphite along with blackberry. An extracted, dense palate is braced by solid tannins and healthy acids. Blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors conclude this rich, flashy wine. Drink 2016–2021.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Minerally white-fruit aromas are clean but generic. In every way, this is a modest but solid Verdejo with proper acidity and overall balance. Briny citrus is the key flavor, while the finish holds form and tastes citrusy and a touch salty.",Spain,Verdejo
"Stalky black cherry and cedar aromas are persuasive enough, but this Crianza also comes with less impressive scents of wet dog and burnt black fruits. Big, tannic and rough on the palate, this tastes of earthy plum, black pepper and bitterness. A drawing, tannic finish brings additional burnt, roasted flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nectarine and white-flower aromas are young and pulsing. This Viura feels fresh and elegant, with grip and weight. Oak-driven flavors are controlled and sit atop a white-fruit base, while this finishes clean and easy, with finesse.",Spain,Viura
"Mossy earthy black-fruit aromas open this powerful laser-focused Mencía. Eschewing the ligh floral style that's common in Ribeira Sacra, this is ripped and intense. Toasty spicy blackberry and plum flavors show a note of lemony oak. The finish is like a spice cabinet of clove, mint, pepper, etc. Drink through 2025.",Spain,Mencía
"Earthy plum and leather aromas fold in notes of prune, rubber and oak. This shows a firm grip, tomato-like acidity and a layer or two of complexity. Peppery, toasty plum, oak and spice flavors are integrated into a quality whole, while this Carignan-Garnacha blend finishes long, dry, peppery and elegant. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Red Blend
"Lush ripe aromas of earthy black fruits and graphite open this varietal Graciano from a warm vintage. Hefty and chewy in feel, this tastes of fudge cake, blackberry and cassis. A lasting stout finish offers tobacco and prune flavors. Yes, this is huge. But there are very few Gracianos that offer this kind of power, flavor and intensity. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Graciano
"The nose on this Navarran rosado is briny and strained. The palate is on the heavy side, while flavors of peach pit and citrus peel finish pithy and mildly bitter. This will not age well.",Spain,Garnacha
"This funky rosé is made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, and there's color, spice aromas and weight dictated by that grape mix. Heavy plum and cherry flavors are fruity but flat in feel, with no cut to the finish. This is interesting but not refreshing.",Spain,Rosé
"Jammy aromas of raisin and cassis include a green whiff and volatility. Flavors of plum and berry are herbal, then overripeness comes back into play. Given the region's high standards, this is just o.k.",Spain,Grenache-Carignan
"Gritty, earthy aromas suggest compost and underripeness. This is grabby and rough on the palate, with muddled, leafy flavors of herbal plum and raspberry. A grating, peppery finish is low on fruit and hard in feel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Plum and currant aromas are gaseous at first, then minerally. This is tight, high in acidity and tannic. Rubbery, lightly briny cherry and plum flavors are held together by firm acidity, while this feels tight and wiry late, with herbal notes and tannic grab.",Spain,Red Blend
"Piercing choppy aromas of balsamic plum, tobacco and cherry lead to a tannic, scratchy palate with saucy, oaky berry flavors that come with a baked overtone. This Rioja from a poor vintage runs long on the finish, with an oak-based vanilla flavor and residual balsamic notes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of Middle Eastern spices, pencil eraser, oak grain, red plum and cherry make for a complete nose. This Tempranillo offers good body and a fair amount of oak on the palate along with spicy plum fruit that tastes more oaky and lactic on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo

"Rubbery and gaseous smelling, this Bordeaux blend also sports plum and berry scents. The palate is solid but somewhat lean, hollow and acidic. Flavors of tomato sauce, red currant and briny berry fruits finish scratchy, with high acidity.",Spain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

"Blackberry, cassis, tire rubber and black olive aromas include a note of vanilla. In the mouth, this cool-vintage Crianza is pinching and tannic. Berry and vanilla flavors are solid but not evolved, while this feels tight, tannic and raw on the finish. Given how cool 2013 was, this is fairly generous. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This tan-colored bubbly from stony soils smells complex, bready, yeasty and a lot like baked apple. A round, yeasty palate is cushioned like fine bedding, while yeasty flavors of bread and apple finish long. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This aromatic Priorat is 72% Carignan and the rest Garnacha. Aromas of floral bath soap, cinnamon and cedar accent plum and berry scents. In the mouth, this is built like a tank. Spicy chocolaty black-plum and cassis flavors finish chewy and thick, with notes of mint and licorice. Drink through 2021.",Spain,Carignan-Grenache
"Aggressive black-fruit aromas come with earthy, spicy notes that include licorice root. This feels tight, linear and a bit sharp. Flavors of plum, berry, pepper and toast set up a finish that's oaky, spicy and acidic.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Peach and yeast aromas are mostly fresh. This Xarello has a citrus-like palate with the suggestion of spritz. Melon, green banana and papaya flavors finish with mild pithy bitterness but nothing off-putting.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"A maderized tint and baked, raisiny flavors make for a rich but flat bouquet. Following suit, this feels heavy, with fig-like richness and choppy tannins. Flavors of raisin, vanilla, coconut and stewed berry fruits end chunky, with spice, vanilla and saucy notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Blueberry and raspberry aromas are ripe, grapy and feature a dash of cocoa. This is lively, punchy and healthy in feel. Medicinal plum and berry flavors are a touch salty, while this finishes with ripeness and good overall balance.",Spain,Garnacha
"Creamy aromas of vanilla and toasted marshmallow are noted on this fresh blend of Tempranillo and Trepat. Although the palate is short and limited, this offers earthy flavors of plum, currant, tomato and herbs. A lightly baked finish is integrated and mildly complex.",Spain,Red Blend
"Plum, cherry and raspberry aromas come with a note of bath soap. Fresh and solid across the palate, this Bobal tastes like it smells, while the finish shows a candied element along with a touch of chocolate.",Spain,Bobal
"Leesy, cheesy aromas fall apart as this struggles a bit to present a clean front side. Almost dilute in feel, this tastes of cidery apple, nectarine and lees. On the finish, a hint of popcorn rises up.",Spain,Albariño
"Cherry cough drop and vanilla aromas have a slight leafiness to them. This feels choppy, bumpy and raw but also fruity, while plum and strawberry flavors show vanilla and wood-grain notes. A resiny oak character is prominent on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flat stewy prune-like aromas are low on life but not off-putting. This feels wide grabby and tannic, while jammy flavors of raspberry and plum finish chunky and expansive, but also tannic and wan. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Scratchy cherry and plum aromas are woody and minerally, to an extent. This feels crimped and hard, while heavy oak lends a hickory note to roasted medicinal red fruit flavors. A woody dry spicy finish is good despite rawness and heat.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
Waxy lightly toasted aromas of yellow apple are more subtle than popping. This barrel-fermented wine offers good weight and balance along with quiet flavors of spiced apple and vanilla. A sophisticated clean finish is lightly oaked in flavor and smooth in feel.,Spain,Viura
"With seven years in bottle, this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is what it is. The nose is stewy and raisiny, with baked berry notes. Like the nose, it feels raisiny and heavy. Flavors of raisin, fig and chocolate keep the theme going, while the finish is herbal and earthy in flavor, with heat.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dusty cherry and red-plum aromas are simple and clean. A fresh, tight, normal feeling palate gets the job done, while flavors of cantaloupe, red plum and nectarine wrap up with pithy citrus notes and a hint of bitterness. Drink this year.",Spain,Rosado
"Blackberry and herbal aromas vie with raw oak and heat on the bouquet of this chunky, jammy, slightly sloppy feeling Monastrell. Dark plum, blackberry and baking spice flavors veer in the direction of clove, and overall this shows itself to be far more oak-based than pure.",Spain,Monastrell
"Earthy, stalky, rubbery berry and plum aromas are solid but rustic. This has a tight, juicy, tomato-like feel and raw flavors of red plum and currant. A hold-steady finish with tomato and mild herbal notes closes this out.",Spain,Tempranillo

"Aromas of latex, strawberry and raspberry Kool-Aid are fine but reticent. Choppy, citric and high in acidity, this has a tight mouthfeel to go with semitart flavors of pink grapefruit and tangerine. Citric acidity drives the finish, which is tangy and intense.",Spain,Rosado
"This is the granddaddy in the Emilio Moro portfolio, but the wine is so ripe and oaky it's syrupy-smelling. Maximum ripeness means it's a bit Port-like on the palate, with baked black-fruit flavors that finish soft and jammy. This brims with power, extraction and flavor but it's grasping for structure. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Purple in color and minerally and deep on the nose, this modern-style Rioja deals aromas of wood smoke, blackberry, cassis and more. The palate is big and bulky, but balance is no issue. Toasty blackberry, chocolate and coffee flavors hold onto a toasty, blackened character on a flush, dynamic finish. Drink now through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flush on the nose, this huge, modern Rioja is loaded with cassis, blackberry and cola aromas. The palate is bold, tannic and flush, with fierceness playing off against lushness. Savory blackberry, hickory and controlled saltiness drive the flavor profile toward a roasted, spicy, blackened finish that's rugged and suggests a long life for this wine. Drink 2016–2024.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ripe black-fruit aromas are schisty and suggestive of burnt toast. An edgy fresh agile palate is a touch choppy, while flavors of peppery black fruits and desert herbs and brush finish crisp, focused and not too heavy. Drink through 2024.",Spain,Red Blend
"Earthy notes of plum and berry include a touch of leafy herbs. This is crisp, elegant and slightly tomatoey in feel, with dry herbal plum and berry flavors that end fresh and savory. There's nothing over the top about this classic Rioja. Drink through 2024.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Crisp clean white-fruit aromas come with a hint of clover. This is mellow and mature on the palate, with nothing aggressive or edgy. Dry, peppery, yeasty flavors show little overt fruit, while this offers a hint of green melon on a dry complex finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Appealing modern-leaning aromas of root beer, berry fruits and vanilla settle with airing and turn more mellow and traditional for Rioja. Slightly plush on the palate, especially given 2013's cool nature, this is balanced despite showing raw tannins. Toasty blackened flavors of baked berry fruits, chocolate and licorice finish long, toasty and peppery. Drink through 2025–2028.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dense ripe black-fruit aromas are moderately spicy. In the mouth, this blend of Syrah, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon is stout and rugged, much like Griñon's other 2011s. Flavors of ripe blackberry and cassis finish with chewy tannins and an overriding sense of ripeness. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Red Blend
"Ripe heady aromas of black cherry, licorice and fir tree are lightly herbal, foresty and on the money. This feels tight as a box of nails, with firm tannins. Black plum, black cherry, blackberry and peppery flavors finish toasty and dark. This has a lot of life left in it. Drink through 2024.",Spain,Red Blend
"Lush berry and marzipan aromas are darkened up by toast and graphite notes. This is a major-league specimen from Bierzo with a full body and manageable tannins. Blackberry, baking spice, mocha and dark-roast-coffee flavors hold steady on the finish before hollowing out. Drink through 2024.",Spain,Mencía
Leesy aromas of vanilla and almond skins set up a vital palate with bold malic acid and a sense of lime. The flavor profile holds onto the nose's leesy essence while delivering nectarine notes in front of a finish with good acidity.,Spain,Godello
"A positive bouquet of melon, white flowers and honey leads to a ripped acidic palate that generates tangy, almost sharp flavors of orange and gooseberry. A citrusy angular finish turns pithy and bitter as it dissipates. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Raspy cheesy fiery aromas of plum and raspberry are a bit harsh. This feels tannic and grabby, while inky berry fruit and resiny oak flavors finish hard and blocky with a mild note of schisty minerality.",Spain,Red Blend
"A heavily charred nose loaded with burnt oak dominates any fruity scents. In terms of flavors and feel, it's more of the same: roasted, burnt oak that's like licking a barrel or hickory branch. This is a one-dimensional oak bomb.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"This shows weedy, herbal aromas, a blocky mouthfeel and leafy, woody red-fruit flavors that taste of faux butter. Dry, peppery, herbal and brawny on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This leads with harsh, stunted aromas of earthy berry fruits and rubber. The palate is equally stunted and rough in feel, while tarry, gritty berry flavors finish drawing.",Spain,Mencía
"Dusty berry, resin and bell-pepper aromas suggest a marginally ripe wine with plenty of oak. A raw punchy choppy mouth feel and woody spicy plum and berry flavors are good but not very deep or evolved. A finish with hard tannins is par for the course.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty aromas are about it for the nose. This sweet rosé offers sugary flavors of strawberry and red licorice candy. Good acidity mellows out the residual sugar in this Bobal-based sparkler, and overall it's pretty good for something that's semisweet.",Spain,Bobal
"Dusty, leesy aromas of lime and vanilla come with hints of peach pit and white flowers. This feels juicy, lean and scouring, while lemon is key on a one-note flavor profile. A long, minerally, citric finish leaves tang and clarity.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Soft, low-intensity aromas of raisin, marzipan and cedar announce a wine that's not in the best of shape. This feels jammy and lacking in foundation. Flavors of loamy berry, prune and raisin finish with a note of licorice.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Almond skin, green banana and pool water aromas precede a spritzy, citric, acidic palate. Flavors of white grapefruit, melon and apple finish zesty and briny, with a citric aftertaste similar to a gin & tonic.",Spain,Verdejo
"Mild citrus aromas of grapefruit are offset by bready, leesy, yeasty scents. This has a citric mouthfeel with the suggestion of lime. Flavors of orange peel and gooseberry finish briny, with a puply feel.",Spain,Verdejo
"Stalky, oily aromas are almondy and low on fruit. This shows weight and snappy acidity along with peach, apricot and persimmon flavors. Fleshy and mostly fresh, this seems to have suffered a bit in the cold, rainy, frost-ridden conditions of 2013.",Spain,Godello
"Tight aromas of cranberry and red plum turn cheesy and like saline when allowed to air out. This is wide in feel but hollow in the center, with flavors of buttered oak and generic red fruits. Fresh in feel but medicinal tasting on the finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"A round, cidery, gaseous nose includes sulfuric notes and yeasty, bready accents. This runs soft on bubbles and feels a lot like Sprite or 7-Up. Lemon-lime core flavors are monotone, while grassy green-apple flavors take over on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Crusty black-fruit aromas are minerally and charred, with blackberry and earthy notes lurking below deck. This is a tannic, wall-to-wall RDD that's pumping baked flavors of blackberry, chocolate, herbs and peppercorn. The finish is deep but not fierce. Drink this powerful wine through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dusty, gritty citrus aromas are softened by leesy notes and a vanilla scent. The palate is foamy and short on complexity. Flavors of orange, nectarine and white pepper turn slightly bitter, while citric acidity lends freshness to the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Name and reputation get you only so far, as this underwhelming offering from a poor vintage proves. Compact stewy aromas of baked berry fruits and asphalt are the appetizer. A main course of chunky jammy stewy berry and prune flavors finishes with a desiccated essence. Unico is known to age for decades, but not this vintage. Drink now for what it's worth.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Vanilla and bitter peach-pit aromas open this blend of 70% Garnacha Blanca with 30% Viognier. In the mouth, this is round, with healthy acidity. Waxy melony flavors are further softened by lees and vanilla notes, while the finish is creamy and a touch flat.",Spain,White Blend
"This is a solid Verdejo with stony aromas of citrus fruits, grapefruit in particular. A palate with citric acidity creates a fresh platform for orange and grapefruit flavors. A round plump finish with briny citrus flavors is a good ending.",Spain,Verdejo
"Floral leesy aromas of chunky stone fruits and citrus come with a green note of lettuce leaf. This feels round and a touch oily, while briny mildly bitter flavors of citrus finish pithy.",Spain,Albariño
"Earthy plum and stalky berry aromas are bolstered by bold oak aromas. This feels good and healthy, with spicy oaky flavors that are dry lactic and push the wine's fruit to the background. A woody spicy, minty finish ends this. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Tempranillo
Compost aromas and a clunky feeling palate get this off on the wrong foot. Flavors of burnt berry fruit and sweetness fail to impress. This shows hardly any snap on a cloying finish.,Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This could be the best Astrales to date. Alluring scents of plum, blueberry and spice are backed by balsam dust and briary pipe-tobacco aromas. Deep and tannic on the palate, then packed with mocha, chocolate, toasted marshmallow, cassis and cherry cough drop flavors, this is fixed and firm now, with a staunch, intense, nervy finish. Drink from 2015–2028.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Light cherry and raspberry aromas are subdued but fresh. This blend of 85% Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon has a medium body, while plum and cherry flavors are straightforward. A lightly baked flavor and spice notes help the finish along, as does the jolt of Cabernet.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dusty, gritty citrus aromas are softened by leesy notes and a vanilla scent. The palate is foamy and short on complexity. Flavors of orange, nectarine and white pepper turn slightly bitter, while citric acidity lends freshness to the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Easygoing apple, pear and citrus aromas precede a mild palate that's a touch dilute. Melon, papaya and tropical flavors finish with a sense of lightness. This is 70% Treixadura with Torrontés and other white grapes.",Spain,White Blend
"Gritty, granular, medicinal aromas smell reedy and like crushed vitamins. A choppy palate and flavors of plum, grape juice and raspberry end with cutting tannins and the essence of raspberry.",Spain,Garnacha
"Bright, punchy raspberry, pomegranate and cherry aromas properly announce cherry and raspberry flavors. This feels snappy, with a medium body. Light spice notes accent bright red-fruit flavors on the finish. For a carbonic macerated Rioja, this is pretty good.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This everyday Viura opens with yeasty aromas of green fruits and chewing gum. It's crisp on the palate, with a medium-weight body. Flavors of apple, citrus, peach pit and white pepper finish fresh.",Spain,Viura
"Aromas of lees and buttercup come with a hint of tropical fruit. This fading, Albariño is plump and generic in feel, without much cut or minerality. Melon, apple and pithy citrus flavors finish similarly, with mild bitterness.",Spain,Albariño
"Pickled and leesy on the nose, this kosher Cava runs low on verve and bubbles. Scallion, green herb and green banana flavors finish similarly, with herbal notes leading the way. 100% Macabeo.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dark in color and showing jammy cherry and boysenberry aromas along with resiny oak, this Tempranillo-Cabernet blend feels sticky and on the verge of cloying. Lightly herbal, green-leaning berry flavors are masked by clove and vanilla notes, while the finish is low on fruit and high on residual oak.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark, mossy, rubbery blackberry aromas are solid. In the mouth, this is punishing, with raw tannins that suggest grapeskins. Dark, chocolaty, savory, spicy flavors of blackberry and black plum finish toasty but bumpy, tannic and rubbery.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Briary berry, tobacco, hickory and spice flavors dominate the nose on this smoky-smelling modern Rioja. This vintage of Amancio, one of Sierra Cantabria's flashiest small-volume wines, is round, meaty and expansive in feel, with oaky flavors of blackberry and bacon. A grabby, spongy, wide finish is savory and oaky in flavor. Give this until 2016, then drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This shimmering barrel-fermented blend of 75% Viura and 25% Tempranillo Blanco opens with stable aromas of apple, butter and fresh corn. An elegant fairly light palate delivers a mix of dry oak, nectarine, peach and apple flavors. This is lithe and comfortable on the finish, with modest but noticeable residual oak.",Spain,White Blend
"This is not a cookie-cutter Cava. It opens with apple juice aromas along with yeast and white-bread scents. In the mouth, this feels a bit bready and soft. Yeasty flavors of papaya, green banana and melon see a white-bread note return on the finish. This is 100% Xarello (Pansa Blanca).",Spain,Sparkling Blend
Green-apple and honeyed aromas are more simple and anonymous than special. This varietal white Grenache has a shearing linear acidic palate that fosters tart flavors of tangerine and lemon peel. A stony drawn finish is crisp and zesty.,Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Earthy plum and stalky berry aromas are bolstered by bold oak aromas. This feels good and healthy, with spicy oaky flavors that are dry lactic and push the wine's fruit to the background. A woody spicy, minty finish ends this. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Leathery, baked aromas of cheesy oak and red berry fruits are a bit lacking in pop but are reflective of typical Rioja Crianza. A full grabby palate shows earthy, buttery flavors of baked stalky berry fruits and oak. A grabby chunky finish wraps this up.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Stalky, soupy berry aromas come up shy on elegance. This feels clampy and hard with rocky tannins. Standard berry fruit flavors are overshadowed by gritty stalky blackened accents, while the finish is grating and uncushioned but long.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of spiced berry, coffee and balsam wood start slow and pick up intensity. This is powerful but focused from front to back, with hard but honest tannins that will soften with time. Pure, potent flavors of cherry, berry and chocolate come with tons of spicy, peppery oak and all sorts of textural depth. Drink from 2015–2028.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Hailing from a warm region and a warm vintage, this is displaying maximum ripeness on the nose via raisin, prune, blackberry and fig aromas. In the mouth, this is loamy, chewy, a mile deep and rich as Bill Gates. Concentrated black cherry, blackberry, cassis, chocolate and mocha flavors conclude with baked notes, licorice and tobacco. So smooth, yet bullish. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Deep berry aromas blend with sweet, creamy, spicy oak notes on the nose of this cellar-worthy bruiser, which is live-wire, energetic and holding a lot in reserve. A full allotment of oak-driven flavors include coffee, mocha, pepper, baked berry and chocolate. On the finish, it's huge and tastes of toast, medicinal berry and chocolate-drenched cherries. Drink from 2015–2025.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Briny tropical fruit and minerally aromas are most prominent on this white wine made from Jaen, a.k.a. Mencía. The palate has a leesy quality to it, but overall this feels standard, with mild melon and vanilla flavors.",Spain,Jaen
"Red-fruit aromas come with a hint of animal, something that's not uncommon to Bobal. An expansive palate is mildly abrasive, while chunky plum flavors end with heat and skins-driven bitterness",Spain,Bobal
"Aromas of black-olive juice, animal hide and seashell fail to offer much fruit, even with swirling. A tough palate shows no clear point of entry, while herbal black-fruit flavors draw in rather than expand on the finish. This is a Syrah-led blend with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Graciano, aka Tintilla de Rota. It hails from Cádiz.",Spain,Red Blend
"This cool-vintage Garnacha smells earthy almost to the point of compost. A chunky, fairly heavy palate is bolstered by a shot of acidity, while rubbery dark-berry flavors finish with a reprise of earth character and moss.",Spain,Garnacha
"Modest white-fruit aromas share space on the nose with seashell and briny notes. This feels tight and moderate in depth. Flavors of lemon and tangerine are mild, while this loses some clarity on the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Losada is known for its red Mencía, but this Godello debut is well done. A waxy floral nose with apple and stone-fruit aromas sets up a round full balanced palate with bold acidity. Salty notes accent peach and apple flavors, while this displays grip on a lingering finish. Sophisticated is a good way to describe this.",Spain,Godello
"Citrus and white-fruit aromas are elegant, smooth and suggestive of Burgundy, which makes sense given that this was aged in oak. The right amount of acidity lends lightness and length to the palate, while ripe lime and honeydew flavors are well oaked. A fresh friendly finish is minerally and crystal clean.",Spain,Godello
"Dark, mossy, rubbery blackberry aromas are solid. In the mouth, this is punishing, with raw tannins that suggest grapeskins. Dark, chocolaty, savory, spicy flavors of blackberry and black plum finish toasty but bumpy, tannic and rubbery.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty berry and cherry aromas include candied notes of cherry cough drop and marshmallow. Simple and choppy in feel, with some resiny oak character, this tastes like red plum and vanilla, while the aftertaste turns salty.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Floral red-plum aromas come with a welcome note of wild herbs. A punchy, stout palate is juicy and possesses short, bold plum and boysenberry flavors. This bright Garnacha doesn't fall off on the finish; it's a good choice for burgers or tacos.",Spain,Garnacha
"This here is classic amontillado. Aromas of toffee, nuts and dried stone fruits set up a round, racy but regular palate. Salted caramel is key to a fresh traditional flavor profile, while bracing lively acidity creates length on a standard tasting finish.",Spain,Sherry
"Fresh stony apple and citrus aromas are composed. Following that lead, this feels focused and fresh. Flavors of stone fruits, citrus fruits and white pepper finish crisp but not real long or deep.",Spain,Albariño
"Apple, peach and yeast aromas are welcoming but a little wayward. This brut nature shows roundness on the palate and no coarseness. Briny apple and dried-apricot flavors are calm on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Alluring aromas of vanilla, cedar, tobacco and blackberry are well-knit and exemplify fine modern Rioja in a good vintage. The palate is tight and wiry, with forceful acidity. Flavors of blackcurrant and berry are bright but come with a rich, oaky accent of coconut. A fresh, full, angular, juicy finish indicates that this will stay in good shape through at least 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty, clammy, white fruit aromas are generic. This is pulpy in feel with a vague focus. Leesy, pithy citrus flavors are standard and short on personality, while this finishes adequately with a mild citric lift.",Spain,Albariño
"Popcorn and apple aromas ride highest on a lightly baked and toasty bouquet. This feels clean and correct, but basic. Flavors of spiced apple and melon blend with fresh celery and lettuce notes in front of a minerally lime-tinged finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Don't let the gold color fool you, this is quite vital with floral, leesy, almost grassy aromas. Bracing acidity is at the core with clover, grass, quince and sour-apricot flavors. Blasting acidity is a force on the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Cherry and raspberry aromas are spunky and simple in front of a crisp edgy palate. Medicinal, lightly rubbery flavors of cherry and plum finish with a raw rub, juicy acidity, a lean body and mild heat.",Spain,Garnacha
"Gritty plum and currant aromas are basic but fresh. Ditto the palate, which shows acidic scratch but not too much. Prickly lightly oaked cherry and plum flavors end with scratchy freshness, lean tannins and lasting berry notes.",Spain,Garnacha
"Minerally cherry and raspberry aromas are as crisp as the black volcanic soil this varietal Listán Negro comes from. Bright in color, juicy and aggressive on the palate, with candied cherry flavors that are short on complexity, this Canary Islands wine tastes of berry residuals and brown sugar on the finish.",Spain,Listán Negro
"Light, almost neutral aromas are like stream water touched up with lime. This is basic on the palate, but easy to process. Flavors of papaya and melon are a bit leesy, while this Treixadura-Torrontés blend is short on the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Saucy blueberry aromas are a touch muddled and difficult to decipher, while this Garnacha feels medium in body and healthy. Raspberry and plum flavors come with a resiny, pasty oak note, while medicinality rises up on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Apple and pear aromas are dusty and leesy. This varietal white Grenache feels linear, with no up or down to the mouthfeel. Flavors of citrus fruits and mango finish lean, crisp and minerally, with lemony acidity.",Spain,Grenache Blanc
"Floral plum and horsey aromas comprise the nose on this multigrape blend led by Bobal. A grabby palate exhibits raw, tough tannins, while plum and berry flavors finish rugged.",Spain,Red Blend
"Round, creamy apple aromas open things up. This is melony and soft in feel, with flavors of cider, lemon and lychee. A tropical-leaning finish is solid but suggestive of a wine in decline. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"This single-vineyard Rioja is smooth, pure and elegant. Aromas of lemon peel, tobacco, cookie dough, marzipan, spiced plum and cassis set up a lush, deep palate with saturated flavors of wild raspberry, ripe plum, chocolate and fig. Compelling notes of licorice and chocolate are accompanied by a touch of youthful heat and burn on the finish. Best from 2015 through 2025.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ripe, muscular aromas of forest floor, blackberry, cassis and violet are stunningly attractive. This is showing vise-grip tannins in support of blackberry, licorice, mocha and woodspice flavors. Café mocha and an oaky, creamy note of toffee work the finish on this well-structured wine that should be drunk from 2015–2025.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This burly Tempranillo opens with an alluring blend of graphite, stony mineral, marzipan and ripe black-fruit aromas. The palate is lusty, giant and tannic, but not mean or fierce. Blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors end with café mocha and licorice notes, while tannic grab suggests aging this until 2015–16 and drinking through 2023.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Apple, peach and yeast aromas are welcoming but a little wayward. This brut nature shows roundness on the palate and no coarseness. Briny apple and dried-apricot flavors are calm on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Grassy green underdeveloped aromas are not what Emilio Moro wines are known for, but given that this is a 2013, these scents are not without foundation. The palate follows the nose with raw pulling tannins and green-leaning flavors of basil, plum and boysenberry. A tight scouring finish is consistent with what came before it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mild aromas of butter, hay and sea water feed into a crisp fresh palate that's punchy and solid. Lightly salted briny white-fruit flavors are classic for a fino, while this offers hints of vanilla and white pepper on the back end.",Spain,Palomino
"Woody notes of sawdust and cinnamon stick drive a mostly fruitless nose. This feels lean and fresh, but foamy. Dry, salty and savory more than fruity, this blend of Trapat and Garnacha finishes steady, with notes of citrus fruits.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Potent earthy cherry and animal aromas are neither too pushy nor overbearing. This is quite full and concentrated, with a ripe-fruit mix of black plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors. Chocolaty oak is even more out front on a deep finish. Drink through 2024.",Spain,Mencía
"Elegant spicy aromas of dried red fruits and plum are fresh and clean. A pure forward medium-bodied palate holds flavors of spiced cherry, plum and vanilla. Those flavors are repeated and unbroken on a clean lithe finish. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Earthy black-fruit aromas show a side note of rubber. This feels tight, deep and concentrated, with hard tannins. Blackberry, cassis, toast and dark-chocolate flavors finish firm and dry, with a chocolaty aftertaste. Drink this full bold true-to-form Ribera del Duero through 2025.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Loamy, ripe aromas of raisin and prune are neither exact nor direct. This has a heavy, tannic mouthfeel with balance issues. Rubbery plum and prune flavors finish with a soft, spread-out feel.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Saline and grapy aromas comprise the nose on this basic red. Hard tannins create pinch and a rubbery feel, while the flavor profile includes solid but minimally expressive black currant and dark plum. This is perfectly drinkable but hollow.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Pungent, feline aromas of green citrus and passion fruit filter into a citric, pulpy palate. Flavors of mixed citrus fruits, green herbs, onion and passion fruit finish heavy, with a lingering note of pickle brine.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"A neutral nose shows generic white-flower notes and yeast. This feels ultra ripe and candied on the palate, while tropical flavors of mango and peach are very ripe and finish plump, with only modest acidity.",Spain,Verdejo
"Briny, pickled aromas come with hints of citrus and flower blossom. This fast-aging Albariño is melony in feel, but it lacks the variety's patented kick and acidity. As a result, peach and apricot flavors are fleshy and chunky.",Spain,Albariño
"Harmonious but mild cherry and raspberry aromas are light and nice. This is substantive enough, with rubbery tannins and some chewiness to the palate. Generic flavors of raspberry and red plum finish mellow and easy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Despite some grit and tar on the nose, this Rioja opens well with spicy cherry and plum aromas. A standard, mild palate is satisfactory, while lightly roasted slightly briny plum and berry flavors end with a hint of saltiness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Gritty stalky aromas suggest that the original material for this Gran Reserva was not fully ripe. This feels wide chunky and grabby, with harsh tannins. Stalky flavors of herbal raspberry and plum come with oaky vanilla accents and tomatoey spice on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Stony peach and mandarin orange aromas are touched up by a note of white licorice gumdrop on this well-cut, finesse-filled Albariño. In the mouth, an elegant dance ensues between minerality, lees notes and citric acidity. Flavors of apricot, peach and melon finish minerally and with a slow but steady fade. Drink through 2016.",Spain,Albariño
"This basic Tempranillo smells dry and spicy but also dilute and mellow, with a note of cherry and red plum on the bouquet. Fresh, fleshy and fruity in terms of feel, this tastes of simple cherry and plum, while the finish is a touch tannic.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stalky aromas of shrubs and bushes blend with scents of dried cherry and currant. A hard-smacking, tannic palate delivers basic berry and plum flavors that finish with a riper note of prune along with parching dryness.",Spain,Red Blend
"Minerally white-fruit aromas lack specificity. This is fresh but standard in feel, with briny flavors of nectarine, apple, citrus pith and nut skins. A dilute finish is fresh but thin. Why this blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Airén and Verdejo costs what it does is beyond comprehension because it smells, tastes and feels generic.",Spain,White Blend
"Punchy plum and raspberry aromas are light and fresh, as is the palate, which introduces jumpy acidity to the equation. Like the nose, this tastes of basic red fruits, cherry and plum in particular, while the finish is persistently fruity. This is 54% Tempranillo and 46% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Mild aromas of butter, hay and sea water feed into a crisp fresh palate that's punchy and solid. Lightly salted briny white-fruit flavors are classic for a fino, while this offers hints of vanilla and white pepper on the back end.",Spain,Palomino
"Floral melon and peach aromas are mellow. This feels round, with citrusy acidity cutting into the body. Basic grapefruit and apricot flavors are friendly, while this is a touch foamy on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Despite initial yeasty, bready aromas, this benchmark mass-market fino has popping acidity that adds spine and zest to an otherwise oily feeling palate. Lightly buttery white-fruit flavors are mildly salty on the finish, sort of like saltines.",Spain,Palomino
"Black cherry and plum aromas are solid. This is chunky and heavyset, but comfortable across the palate. Generic plum and berry flavors are pure, while this finishes plump, chunky and with a hint of chocolate.",Spain,Garnacha
"Aromas of orange zest, apple cider and yeast come in front of a plump, slightly wayward palate with citric acidity. Generic citrus flavors finish lemony but with acidic scour.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Largely neutral on the nose, then tangy and still fresh on the palate, this drink-now Viura is clean but unexciting. Flavors of generic citrus finish firm, with a pithy aftertaste.",Spain,Viura
"Straightforward red-fruit aromas suggest cherry and plum. Rubbery, pinching tannins are the adhesive for this punchy young Rioja that tastes of raspberry and cherry and finishes steady.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Initial charred gritty aromas become more yeasty, round, complex and friendly with airing. This feels solid and moderately full in body, with dry yeasty neutral flavors that aren't particularly fruity. A dry, subtle finish is classy and long.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"With a bright purple color and integrated but potent aromas of oak, mineral, schisty earth and black fruits, this is a rock-solid yet approachable and delicious wine. A structured palate is firm and braced by fine acidity, while flavors of wild herbs, licorice and blackberry finish with a touch of molasses as well as brown sugar and anise. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is one minerally wine for Rioja. Stony scents blend with latex and Band-Aid, while lemon peel and hard-driving berry aromas define the nose. Monster tannins are absorbed by the wine's broad foundation, while flavors of smoke, oak, plum and wild berry finish savory and long, with a final shot of oak-based clove. Best from 2018–2025.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Composed and elegant on the nose, this classic Priorat blend of Grenache and Carignan opens with minerally berry aromas and a touch of fine oak. The palate is tight, intense and well etched, with dark, toasty flavors of schisty black fruits. Licorice flavors and herbal notes guide the finish on this excellent Spanish red. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Grenache-Carignan
"Rubbery aromas of pencil eraser are also smoky and odd, with the suggestion of clove. In the mouth this is pinched at first, then more oaky and creamy, but also rubbery. Roasted plum and stewed berry flavors finish tannic, with latent berry and cherry notes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Peachy aromas are less than perky, while in the mouth this is lemony, narrow and citric. Flavors of lemon and tangerine finish with stony mineral notes but also a drawing citric acidity.",Spain,Albariño
"Nectarine and white peach aromas are pithy, pointed and briny like sea water. This feels citrusy and pulpy, while zesty citric flavors of grapefruit, scallion and green herbs finish with residual pithy briny notes.",Spain,White Blend
"Lightly toasted and animated up front, with mixed berry, asphalt and gritty aromas, this feels tough, tannic and chewy. A blend of herbal berry and green notes infiltrate standard raspberry and cherry flavors. This finishes slightly bitter and with notes of green herbs.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Burnt smelling like charred steak, this also offers raw oak scents along with boysenberry aromas. A dense, pounding, tannic palate holds blackened, peppery flavors of blackberry. A smoky finish smolders with peppery spice and hard tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy aromas of saline, minerals and iodine dominate herbal fruit notes. This has a tomatoey, high-acid feel and rubbery tannins, while flavors of salty, briny red plum and currant finish similarly. A good mouthfeel is the highlight on this briny Monastrell.",Spain,Monastrell
"Gritty, oily aromas are gaseous, rubbery and tough to dig into. The palate is heavy but acidic, with sulfuric notes and flavors of grapefruit and citrus pith. Tangy, grabby and tannic on the finish.",Spain,Rosado
"Leafy, mulchy red-fruit aromas are low on pop and freshness. In the mouth, it's the opposite: this feels lean, shearing and snappy. Flavors of red currant, tart plum and pie cherry finish with hard-driving acidity and a sense of tartness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rusty and translucent in color, this smells downright grassy and green, with tobacco and leafy notes as prominent as dried cherry scents. Following the nose, this is lean and grating, with tart plum and herbal flavors. Given 2009's overall warmth, this green, underripe reserva is surprisingly difficult.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Punchy plum and raspberry aromas are light and fresh, as is the palate, which introduces jumpy acidity to the equation. Like the nose, this tastes of basic red fruits, cherry and plum in particular, while the finish is persistently fruity. This is 54% Tempranillo and 46% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Creamy aromas of custard give off a soapy smell. This feels citric, while nectarine and orange flavors are a bit funky. On the finish, this is more fresh and direct than flavorful.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A floral red-fruit nose opens this juicy yet basic Tempranillo. Raw edginess on the palate comes with candied plum and raspberry flavors, while this finishes fresh, with a modest salty note.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This dark-colored, extracted Priorat smells largely of oak and mint on top of lightly herbal, green-leaning plum and currant. The palate is wiry, with citric acidity that creates tartness to go with monotone red-fruit flavors. Rough, tough and crisp on the finish, with tomatoey acidity and hard tannins.",Spain,Grenache-Carignan
"Aromas of prune, raisin, tomato leaf and rose petals lead to a somewhat heavy palate with a stewy character and big tannins. Baked, raisiny red-fruit flavors come with a note of caramel or molasses, while desiccated berry flavors dominate the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Common cherry and berry aromas lead to a fruit-punch palate with some stickiness. This tastes ripe, with nothing distinguished beyond basic berry flavors. Sweet plum and berry notes steer the finish.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"Aromas of cherry Kool-Aid and fruit punch offer a sprinkle of spice in the background. This is simple in feel, with citrusy acidity. The red-fruit flavors are easy going and the finish is mild.",Spain,Garnacha
"Nectarine and white peach aromas are pithy, pointed and briny like sea water. This feels citrusy and pulpy, while zesty citric flavors of grapefruit, scallion and green herbs finish with residual pithy briny notes.",Spain,White Blend
"Floral blueberry and black-currant aromas are jammy. Following the nose, this Garnacha feels chunky and low in acidity. Jammy flavors of blueberry and cassis end in a pudgy but friendly way. Drink this low-acid offering sooner rather than later.",Spain,Garnacha
"Straightforward peach, nectarine and apple aromas are fleshy, as is the palate, which puts out leesy creamy flavors of apple and green banana. A leesy, low-acid finish is plump and lacks follow through. Drink immediately.",Spain,Godello
"Untamed plum and cherry aromas are a bit strained. This everyday Garnacha is fresh and fruity in feel, with good but standard plum and cherry flavors. An edgy grating finish with a spot of oak character wraps this up.",Spain,Garnacha
"Citrus and peach pit aromas are mild. This is clean but basic on the palate with citrus, nectarine and lime flavors. A clean refreshing finish is a nice way to wrap things up. This is Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo.",Spain,White Blend
"This is yet another unconventional, funky Rioja from this producer. Herbal saucy aromas of briar patch and raisin are a challenge to process. On the palate, this is intensely tannic. Herbal, spicy cherry, plum and licorice flavors finish with juicy acidity. Drink through 2028.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cedar, bold berry and cassis aromas come with an exotic note of sandalwood. In the mouth, this feels alert, bright and grabby, with a full load of muscular tannins and acidity. Flavors of spiced blackberry, coffee and chocolate are toasty and a touch burnt in character on the finish. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy raspberry and strawberry aromas are a touch murky. This feels wide and broken down, with jagged tannins. Earthy, undefined, unrefined flavors of mixed berry fruits finish raw and tannic.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of scrambled eggs are cidery and flat. This feels soft and unfocused, with low acidity and a mild bead. Green flavors of lettuce and herbs are more salad-like than fruity, while the finish is soft and lacking in edge.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A muscular, oaky nose shows cool, grapy, berry aromas that carry an animal streak. This is drawing, tannic and rubbery on the palate, with meaty, hard-spice flavors of blackberry that turn mildly bitter and hot on the finish.",Spain,Grenache
"Briny, minerally aromas of vitamin dust and lees feed into a yeasty, round, melony palate. Flavors of yellow apple, mango and mustard finish yeasty, soft and briny.",Spain,Verdejo
"Aromas of white flowers and mild tropical fruits turn more gritty with time. In the mouth, this Viura is dilute but not empty. Flavors of Bartlett pear, lime and nectarine finish tangy and lean.",Spain,Viura
"This ripe, modern red shows all the positives of Toro and the 2009 vintage. Lusty, exuberant aromas of black fruits, vanilla and pipe tobacco are highly appealing, while the palate is muscular and tannic yet balanced. Blackberry, cassis, chocolate and lemon flavors finish firm and bold. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Start packing your cellar with 2010 Ribera gems like this wine, which is offering graphite and minerally plum and berry aromas in front of a full-bodied, hard-driving palate. Ripe, extracted blackberry and lightly herbal flavors finish with tons of residual weight and tannins. This is loud, burly and delicious; drink from 2016–2030.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Common cherry and berry aromas lead to a fruit-punch palate with some stickiness. This tastes ripe, with nothing distinguished beyond basic berry flavors. Sweet plum and berry notes steer the finish.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"Aromas of cherry Kool-Aid and fruit punch offer a sprinkle of spice in the background. This is simple in feel, with citrusy acidity. The red-fruit flavors are easy going and the finish is mild.",Spain,Garnacha
"Spunky, edgy, slightly cheesy cherry and plum aromas come in front of a palate with crisp acidity and firm tannins. Tart plum and pie cherry flavors finish with scraping acidity and a touch of sourness.",Spain,Garnacha
"Light, fresh aromas of tomato and plum are gritty. This feels round for the most part, with rubbery tannins. Medicinal, slightly minty plum and berry flavors end with acceptable rawness and a latex note.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ideal Albariño aromas of buttercup, orange blossom, mild citrus, peach and seashell set up a mature but fresh palate, with layered complexity and minerality to spare. Flavorwise, this is a touch waxy, with an emphasis on pear, peach and melon. A dry, clean, slightly dusty finish sends this off in fine fashion.",Spain,Albariño
"This is a dark saturated fully oaked Rioja with savory briary berry aromas and notes of coffee grounds, fennel and hard spices. A full chunky palate is displaying young rubbery tannins. Flavors of baked plum, grilled meat, raw oak and lemon peel finish with toasty oak that veers towards maple. Drink through 2030.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Briary plum and leather aromas are slightly toasty. This feels just chewy and dense enough to rise above lean and dainty. Spicy peppery berry flavors come with a dusting of chocolaty oak, while the finish hums along with a firm but manageable tannic grip. Drink through 2021.",Spain,Red Blend
"A bright purple tint announces a jumpy youthful-smelling wine with plum, black currant and oak aromas. This is Carignan, Syrah, Garnacha and Cab Sauvignon, and it's full in body but also juicy and lively. Savory, saucy plum and berry flavors ride a wave of crisp acidity, while the finish feels dry and exact, with minty medicinal overtones. Drink this snappy wine through 2021.",Spain,Red Blend
"Like many 2009 RDD wines, this is at max ripeness and maybe over the edge. Ripe earthy plum and prune aromas feed into a heavy palate that's not exactly skipping. Prune, blackberry, blueberry and juniper flavors finish dense and settled. This is ready to drink: it is what it is.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is so toasty and heavily oaked that it smells burnt and acrid. In the mouth this is pinched, tannic and tough. Flavors of plum, raspberry and vanilla finish scratchy and abrasive with drum-like tightness. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lightly oxidized aromas of apple and peach are waxy and on the cusp of being stale. In the mouth, however, this is stony and citric, with orange and lemon flavors. Finishing acidity and stoniness cut through this wine's older, heftier qualities. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"Aromas of ocean breeze and white clover are raw but good. This feels round, pulpy and citrusy, with green slightly bitter flavors of citrus, honey and brine. Acidity plays a big role in keeping this afloat. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"Match stick and sulfur notes fade into citrus and kiwi on an O.K. nose. Kind of late in its life already, this smells big and pulpy. Apple and bitter-melon flavors finish citrusy. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"Stalky white-fruit, lees and vanilla aromas are less than inviting. This feels tired, obtuse and out of shape, meaning it's past its prime and won't improve. Bitter, leesy peach and melon flavors finish similarly.",Spain,Godello
"Almondy in color, with bready, drawn aromas of mustard and pithy citrus, this feels flat and chunky. Flavors of almond skins and pithy white fruits finish with a note of orange peel.",Spain,Macabeo
"Plum and raspberry aromas are honest and pleasant. This is fruity and plummy on first take, but soon it becomes narrow and acidic, with tart, shrill berry and plum flavors that finish juicy and angular, then bitter.",Spain,Carineña
"With a pink-meets-tan color and funky aromas of mustard, grass and citrus, this is challenging but ultimately modest. A lean, light body is home to leesy, mustardy flavors of passion fruit and nectarine, while the finish is citrusy but also mildly bitter.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Aromas of almond skins, pyrazines and spent white fruits struggle to draw you in. This vintage was wet and cool in Galicia, with frost issues, and this shows it. The palate is round but oily in feel, while flavors of saline water, pithy citrus and bitter melon finish peppery and soft, with low acidity.",Spain,Godello
"Chunky aromas of murky red-berry fruits, pie cherry and briny oak struggle to impress. This feels saucy and resiny, while briny, oaky, citric flavors finish scattered and hot. Overall, this woody rosado isn't shining.",Spain,Rosado
"Leafy, earthy cherry and plum aromas lead to a clampy, astringent palate with saucy, tart, rubbery plum flavors. Savory spice notes come up on a tannic, drying, unyielding finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is a very ripe, modern, dark-styled wine with rich berry, tobacco, cola, spice and rooty aromas. The palate is meaty and muscular, but ultimately a bit soft. Flavors of baked berry, prune and licorice finish with toasty oak as well as an extracted, ultraripe texture. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is a ripe, lush wine with aromas of raisin, blackberry, dried herbs and sandalwood. The mouthfeel is grand and wide, with big tannins and lemony acidity. Flavors of blackberry, fig, vanilla and chocolate are highly likeable, while the finish is rich but not overly deep or structured. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Briny, wiry red-fruit aromas are mild but saucy. This blend of Garnacha and Tempranillo feels ordinary, while flavors of briny plum are fresh but limited. A finish with a healthy pulse is fine for what this is.",Spain,Garnacha-Tempranillo
"An earthy, raisiny opening comes around a bit but never suggests freshness. Similarly, this feels blocky, chunky and tannic. Baked flavors of raisin and plum conclude with sticky tannins and grab.",Spain,Red Blend
"Floral, soapy aromas of tomato, cherry and currant are light and lack commitment. This Tempranillo-blend feels rocky despite being light in body, while candied plum, red currant and rose hip flavors hollow out quickly and finish with scratchy tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Clear and lucid to the eye, this Verdejo shows pine, grapefruit, orange and apple aromas along with oily pith. The mouthfeel is more plump and wet than defined, while lychee and melon flavors are offset by tolerable bitter pyrazines and grapefruit flavors.",Spain,Verdejo
"Wiry, withdrawn plum aromas are a touch floral. A jagged palate feel with high acidity and hard tannins frames plum flavors. This is bullish overall and a bit fiery and hot on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
Matchstick sulfur and background red-fruit aromas lead into a simple palate that's wet and lively but doesn't offer a lot to latch onto. Generic citrus and cherry Lifesaver flavors finish with a note of briny salt.,Spain,Rosado
"A whiff of red-apple skins, red plum and spice make for a reasonably clean and fresh nose. This feels plump but still vital. Pithy flavors of citrus and cantaloupe turn more pithy on the finish.",Spain,Rosé
"While this foamy rosé is not elevated, it should appeal to those who like sweet Moscato bubblies. Candied flavors of raspberry, lychee and dried mango finish with a note of pineapple syrup.",Spain,Rosé
"Cherry and raspberry aromas are simple as pie, while this feels a touch astringent and drawing. Tart but fresh plum and raspberry flavors are slightly briny. Juicy and satisfactory on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Leather, raw wood and berry aromas start off this young wine. The palate is fairly raw and gripping, while herbal, peppery blackberry flavors finish with a toasty oak note and tannic rub.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Briny tropical-fruit aromas suggest pickles and cactus. This is chunky in build, with citrusy acidity. Briny citrus flavors cannot be further defined, while citric acidity keeps this fresh through the finish.",Spain,Malvasia
"A mellow, neutral nose doesn't push the envelope. In the mouth, this is round but punchy, with some excess weight. Flavors of apple juice, pear and melon finish with flavors of lime, apple cider and powdered sugar.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Grassy, compost-like aromas carry a peanut accent and not much vivid fruit. This pinches down on what amounts to a clampy palate, while crisp, mildly green berry flavors finish minty and peppery.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Boysenberry aromas are modest and lack spine. In the mouth, this is standard, with oak-based flavors of toast, chocolate and vanilla on top of generic berry. The finish is thick and oaky, with a touch of raisiny flavor.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A simple bouquet offers light apple and melon aromas, while the palate shows some malic acidity before it softens. Melon, apple and a touch of butter work together to create a mild flavor profile, while this is mellow and short on the finish.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Heavy oak aromas rest forcefully on top of plum and black cherry scents. This is fresh and proper in feel, with dominant oaky graininess and medicinal berry flavors that finish woody like a plank.",Spain,Garnacha Blend
"Light lemony aromas are more blowsy than exact. This feels citric and grabby, with oily weight to the palate. Flavors of ripe white grapefruit, nectarine and orange expand but don't evolve on the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Textbook amontillado aromas of butter, peanut, caramel and brine precede a fresh high-energy palate that's fueled by acidity. Nutty flavors of toffee include plenty of salt and some smoke, while this finishes long and slightly fiery.",Spain,Palomino
"Aromas of lemon curd and citrus blossom come with a hint of pine. This feels lemony and narrow, with a tight body that's showing little to no give. Nectarine, citrus and green-melon flavors are fresh prior to a dry citrusy finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Gritty herbal aromas of olive, asphalt and compost announce a cool-vintage wine. This feels raw and massively tannic. Roasted barely ripe plum and berry flavors finish bone dry and pulling.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Chunky apple aromas turn more heavy and gaseous as this sits. On the palate, this feels pulpy and chunky. Flavors of generic citrus fruits and peach are briny and lightly bitter, while iodine, nut skin and citrus pith flavors drive the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Wheaty and waxy on the nose, this Viura also smells of vinyl and corn. A limited palate is directed by pointed acidity, while flavors of almond skins and pithy citrus are somewhat bitter and finish with zero character.",Spain,Viura
"Cheesy, oaky aromas are staunch and less than appealing. A choppy, astringent palate and mulchy, briny berry flavors are less than helpful, while a rubbery feeling finish also fails to bring this around.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This Riesling smells slightly tropical but more like grass and asparagus. A linear body is propped up by lemony acidity, while flavors of lemon peel, tangerine and lees finish citric. Overall, this smells and tastes nothing like the Riesling most people know.",Spain,Riesling
"Seltzer and sauerkraut are off putting on the nose. It's scattered and salty tasting, with citrus and celery notes.",Spain,Verdejo
"Aromas of rubber and floor wax lack fruit and nuance. This has a high-acid, granular mouthfeel that lacks full cohesion. Waxy, salty flavors crowd out primary fruit flavors, while this finishes briny, high in acid and salty.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Chunky aromas of hay and mealy stone fruits are acceptable. This Sauvignon Blanc has a melony, creamy palate and mealy flavors of melon and papaya that match the bouquet. A yeasty, undefined finish indicates this is past its prime.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Dark and ominous in color, with a grapy, rustic, smoky nose, this Garnacha is high in acid, rubbery and tannic on the palate. Semisour black-plum flavors finish equally tannic and acidic.",Spain,Garnacha
"Cherry and red-plum aromas are also horsey, jammy and suggestive of bacon fat. An astringent palate ranks as severely rugged and drawing. Bitter red-plum flavors simmer prior to a hard-tannin finish that's peppery and tart.",Spain,Garnacha
"Inviting aromas of balsam wood, pipe tobacco and black fruits are lusty and deep. This is big and drawing on the palate, with ribald flavors of blackberry, licorice, chocolate and mocha. A rich, chocolaty, oaky finish with controlled acidic kick and tannic bite confirm the wine's power and spirit. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Intense but classy aromas of berry fruits, minerality, vanilla and chocolate are milder and richer than the wine's racy, structured, acid-rich palate. Flavors of blackberry come with a shock of bracing tartness, while oaky aftershocks offer up chocolate and woodspice flavors. A zesty, firm, hard-driving finish brings a touch of sharpness. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Black plum, berry, violet petal and ultimately raisiny ripeness define the nose on this dark and lusty Priorato. A ripe, saturated, muscular palate is home to blackberry, baked plum and spice flavors, while burnt brown sugar, pepper and herbal flavors dance comfortably on a deep, lengthy finish. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromas of wet rock, chewing gum and mild citrus fruits are straight down the middle. This feels modest, while cottony flavors of citrus and watermelon finish short and easy.",Spain,Rosé
"This three-grape blend includes Sauvignon Blanc, Verdejo and Merseguera. It's gold in color, while heavy and cidery on the nose. A chunky, citrusy palate is globular and tastes of grapefruit, tangerine and salt, while an oily feeling, round finish lacks complexity.",Spain,White Blend
"The nose on this blend of Grenache, Carignan and other grapes burns and smells of iodine, mushroom, olive and rustic berry fruits. High acidity and an obtuse mouthfeel house salty, briny, minerally plum flavors, while the finish runs low on fruit.",Spain,Red Blend
"Grapy wild blackberry aromas and then a tough, tannic palate tell you most of what you need to know about this hard-knuckled specimen. Flavors of grape skins, plum and blackened spice finish bitter and peppery.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Stalky berry aromas lack overt ripeness and pop. This feels pushed to the center, with minimal mouthfeel. Stalky, lightly burnt and leathery berry flavors finish hot and dried out.",Spain,Tempranillo
This blend of Bobal and Garnacha is clean and neutral up front. A healthy feeling palate is highly regular but solid. Standard citrus and currant flavors end with moderate length.,Spain,Rosé
"A heavy gold color announces an oily, floral nose that suggests gardenias. The palate is quite oily in feel and very plump, with decent acidity and unique flavors of persimmon, spice and exotic fruits. This is oily and a bit clunky on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,White Blend
"Burnt hay, grapefruit and waxy apple aromas lead to a palate with briny citrus flavors. Pithy grapefruit and orange flavors carry the finish, which is quick and light in weight.",Spain,Viura
"Aromatically, this is pretty good as dry apple and a pinch of green herbs work the nose. In the mouth, however, this is shear and citric, with zesty, almost sour flavors of tangerine, orange and grapefruit. The finish is similar, with thinly cut acidity causing tartness.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Grassy aromas of green tobacco and alfalfa come in front of a lightly abrasive palate. Herbal red-berry flavors are suggestive of minty cranberry, cherry and raspberry. This turns more fruity and less green on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Simple red-berry aromas are about as good as this gets. In the mouth, it's wet but dilute. Flavors of pithy citrus and grass finish with grapefruit and bitter flavors. This is basic at best and empty at worst.",Spain,Rosado
"Simple light aromas of vanilla and lees set up a round palate with ample acidic kick. For the most part, this is chunky and weighty, with apple and peach flavors, while mild bitterness in the form of peach pit closes this out.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dusty, citrusy aromas of pineapple turn more tropical with airing. This is 60% Garnacha Blanca, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, and it's a bit flat on the palate. Flavors of white fruits are candied but also bitter, while this finishes with honeyed sweetness offset by pithy bitterness.",Spain,White Blend
"Radiator dust, lees and vanilla cookie aromas precede a chunky flat palate. Flavors of lime, melon and apple are as basic as it gets, while the finish is bland except for a hint of pithy bitterness.",Spain,Macabeo
"A bright purple tint announces a jumpy youthful-smelling wine with plum, black currant and oak aromas. This is Carignan, Syrah, Garnacha and Cab Sauvignon, and it's full in body but also juicy and lively. Savory, saucy plum and berry flavors ride a wave of crisp acidity, while the finish feels dry and exact, with minty medicinal overtones. Drink this snappy wine through 2021.",Spain,Red Blend
"Melony floral aromas are friendly and easygoing. On the palate, this is clean and precise, with moderate weight and a touch of oak. Lime and kiwi flavors are a bit sweet, with a welcome oaky offset. On the finish, this Godello fades nicely, with core acidity extending the ride.",Spain,Godello
"Stalky compost and wilted floral aromas are as present as the underlying basic berry scents. This varietal Alicante Bouschet is tannic and slightly abrasive in feel, while warm, bitter, peppery plum and cherry flavors leave heat and burn on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha Tintorera
"Fleshy, powdery aromas of melon and raspberry are not really crisp. This feels basic, with wiry acidity. Briny citrus flavors carry onto a finish that's highly regular but gets the job done.",Spain,Garnacha
"Aromatically, this varietal Prieto Picudo from Asturias shows graphite, wood resin, vanilla and spiced plum. In the mouth, however, it's devoid of structure and thus comes across jammy and flabby. Flavors of baked berry fruits are oaky and rooty, while this is massive on the finish but lacks foundation and framing.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"Distinct aromas of Graham Cracker, coffee and stewed berries precede a tannic, rock-hard palate. Chunky, wayward flavors of blackberry and stalky black plum are earthy and finish with severe tannic grab.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Briary, herbal berry aromas precede a simple, inoffensive palate. Generic, slightly candied and herbal berry flavors end with notes of pepper and mild bitterness. This is 60% Bobal and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Coarse raspberry and plum aromas are backed by a narrow palate with limited flavors of cherry chewing gum and cough drop. This stays consistent by finishing with a wiry, raw feel.",Spain,Bobal
"This varietal Garnacha is chunky and heavily oaked on the nose, with woody aromas of vanilla and plastic. An overtly oaky, awkward feeling palate tastes of resin on top of plum and blackberry, while the finish shows more resin mixed with mint.",Spain,Grenache
"This Merlot-based rosé smells cheesy and not all that fruity. Chunky and obtuse on the palate, this tastes of generic citrus and berry fruits. An adequate finish is par for the course.",Spain,Merlot
"Odd aromas of clove are smoky but mostly come across as weird and forced. This has a lactic, creamy mouthfeel with soft edges. The flavor profile is all wood, and resiny, clove-driven wood at that. A severely sweet, cloying, resiny finish is a lot to deal with.",Spain,Garnacha
"Rough, stalky, yeasty aromas are all over the map. Lemony acidity renders this tight as a drum, while bitter, stalky flavors finish wheaty and bitter. This Tempranillo Blanco is barely worth a go; the pleasure factor is at base level.",Spain,Tempranillo Blanco
"Right away this goes wrong; the nose is smothered with charred, burning oak that smells harsh and like chemicals. A tannic, resiny palate is barely acceptable, as are bitter, burnt, resiny blackberry flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Feral, feline, sweaty aromas precede an awkward palate with bitter flavors of weedy berry, citrus fruits and pyrazines. A scallion-like quality drives the finish on this strange, bitter rosé.",Spain,Rosé
"Floral black-fruit aromas are mildly raisiny and condensed. This is a potent bomber with deep flavors of blackberry, chocolate, nutmeg and fig. Overall, it's fruity, dense and delicious but a touch short on complexity. On the finish, powerful tannins only increase their vise grip. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With so few Mallorcan wines on the market, Anima Negra operates in a vacuum. Thankfully the winery excels with this red made from the local Callet grape. Dry, light, spicy aromas of sandalwood, tobacco and cherry come in front of a medium-bodied, creamy and oaky palate. Flavors of ripe yet spicy cherry and plum finish with notes of wood smoke and baking spices. Drink this unique wine through 2024.",Spain,Red Blend
"Balsam wood, coconut, tobacco and black-fruit aromas feed into a lush, easygoing palate with smooth tannins and lots of weight. This is ripe in raisin and prune flavors along with savory berry, cumin and baking spice notes. A chunky finish delivers chocolate and tobacco flavors but not much bite or structure. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Given how cool and difficult the 2008 vintage was, this is impressive. Bold, oaky aromas of coconut, cola and mocha come with a blackberry backing. Vibrancy and hard tannins push the palate, which brings chocolaty flavors, spice and mocha along with core berry. Licorice, toast and other black flavors drive an oaky, hard finish. Drink through 2021.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Minerally aromas of black fruits, toast, licorice, anise and coconut announce a ripe, stout Tempranillo that's cut from the so-called new-wave cloth. This is vigorous yet full on the palate, with blackberry, boysenberry, licorice, herb and baking spice flavors. A long, chocolaty, layered finish is the perfect ending. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stone-fruit and apple aromas grace a mild bouquet. This feels solid but generic, with chunky peach, citrus and pithy flavors. On the finish, this Verdejo becomes more waxy and heavy in feel.",Spain,Verdejo
"Briny, leesy aromas are funky and sweaty, not clean and lean like most Txakoli. Snappy, citric and decidedly not spritzy, this tastes of lemon, underripe nectarine and tart green apple. A cleansing seltzer-like finish is the closing act.",Spain,Hondarrabi Zuri
"Aromas of raw oak, eucalyptus and gritty berry fruits are hot and leafy. This Tempranillo-based blend feels choppy with aggressive grating tannins. Flavors of baked roasted berry fruits are also herbal, green and leafy, while this finishes crisp, raw and tomatoey in flavor.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Shy honeyed aromas of tropical fruits wind up at banana. This feels fleshy and not direct, while soft powdery flavors of leesy melon and papaya finish with notes of oxidation, as if this is already starting to fade.",Spain,Godello
Big grapy aromas of blackberry and cassis are rather heavy and flat. This has a tannic abrasive mouthfeel in which nothing is smooth. Borderline overripe flavors of baked plum and blackberry finish chocolaty and with baking-spice flavors.,Spain,Tempranillo
"After this Rioja opens with earthy, almost food-like aromas of ground beef, rubber and leather, oak takes over and in march a bacony scent and plenty of char. This is plump and chunky in feel, with earthy, rubbery, savory flavors of charred black fruits and cured meats. It becomes more and more oaky and drawing on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Punchbowl aromas of melon and papaya are a bit watery. The palate is round and simple in feel, with modest acidity. Easygoing flavors of melon and peach finish nice but short. This is basic white wine in every way.",Spain,Verdejo
"This basic Verdejo from Rueda offers minerally apple and citrus aromas in front of a zesty, citric palate. Flavors of orange and nectarine are nice but entirely regular, while the finish is crisp and chalky.",Spain,Verdejo
"Yeasty white-fruit aromas of melon and peach set up a narrow feeling palate with nectarine and peach flavors. This is straightforward Verdejo with no frills. The finish is lasting but simple in feel and flavor. Drink this fresh, quaffable wine right away.",Spain,Verdejo
"Sweet melon, peach and vanilla aromas come with a tropical leaning. The mouthfeel trends toward flat, while modest flavors of apple and melon are supported by soft, melony acidity. While this is good, it's on the flat and flabby side.",Spain,Godello
"A maderized color and flat, old-smelling aromas of molasses and baked beans are barely cutting it. This feels tired, with mildly oxidized flavors of raisin, tobacco and vanilla. Tomato and herbal notes carry the finish on this mostly gone Rioja.",Spain,Red Blend
"The name may suggest a bridge in Florence but this sparkler is Spanish. Lychee, rose water and lime are the aromas, but frankly they are basic. A creamy, fairly thick and cloying palate carries Moscato-based flavors of lychee, lime and mango, while the finish is sugary in feel and flavor.",Spain,Moscato
"A yellow color and skunky aromas are not positive. In the mouth, this is soft and lacking an acidic edge. Flavors of wheat bread and vanilla blend with oxidized white-fruit notes.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of air freshener, lychee and honey introduce a basic, no-bead palate full of tropical flavors that are similar to a Tiki punch with no booze. A mild, low-foam finish is the final act.",Spain,Moscato
"Smooth cool aromas of cedar, lemon peel and cola accent black-fruit scents on this easygoing Mencía. Reedy blackberry flavors come with notes of herbs and spice, while the finish is mild in acidity and hence soft and friendly. Drink now.",Spain,Mencía
"Stalky, bitter aromas of peach pit and white pepper dust announce a dilute palate with bitter flavors of citrus pith and stone-fruit pits along with oxidized notes. This is tired on the finish and seemingly past its prime.",Spain,Godello
"Buttery oak aromas cover up any white-fruit character this Mallorcan white might have in store. Resiny, corny, overly oaky flavors finish like a bowl of buttered movie popcorn.",Spain,Premsal
"Barnyard aromas atop berry scents make for a nose that's not entirely clean. A clipped, tough palate has hard tannins and short berry flavors. A finish with heat and bitterness makes this a tough go.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A blast of burnt wood and sawmill is the greeting on this heavily oaked Garnacha. Specific aromas of wood shavings, creosote and Bourbon barrel amount to a sundae's worth of oak notes. Flavors of char, coffee, chocolate and burnt wood dominate this overly oaked wine that is weak on core fruit.",Spain,Garnacha
"Untamed, foxy aromas of wild berry, bramble bush and olive come in front of a palate with nails for tannins. This tastes highly herbal or mildly green, depending on how you look at it. A raw, hot finish renders this low on charm.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty, briny aromas are low on fruit and charm. This has a hollow, flimsy makeup to go with bitter tangerine and raspberry flavors. At this point, it's almost not worth it. It's better to wait for the 2015.",Spain,Rosado
"This rosé lacks freshness from the start. The nose is mealy and smells of red-apple skins. An oily palate is grabby and flat, while briny melon flavors are also flat. Salty tasting on the finish.",Spain,Rosado
"Initially, this Canary Islands rosado smells like a sweaty gym or a backpacker in need of a shower—it's that funky. In the mouth, it smacks down hard. Short, vegetal flavors turn bitter prior to a finish that tastes more like bitter greens than fruit.",Spain,Rosado
"Roasted black-fruit, horsehide and rubbery aromas filter onto a tannic palate with all sorts of fruit extract and pulp for support. This is a rich, ripe wine from a warm vintage with tons of berry power, oak, herbal notes, tobacco and prune on the flavor profile. The finish is ripe, with spice and licorice flavors.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Everything about this highly functional Rioja is nice. The nose is fresh, minerally and shows complexities like cinnamon aromas and herbs. The palate is snappy and racy, but not shear or acidic. Flavors of plum, berry and oak are pure and bold, while the finish is dry, lightly toasted and shows minerality and coffee notes. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cool rooty aromas of cola and tree bark grace the nose on this ripe but still not fully mature Cabernet Sauvignon (with 5% Merlot). In the mouth, this is choppy due to sandpaper tannins. Flavors of sarsaparilla, pepper, and blackberry are dense and chewy, while the finish is bumpy and scraping due to aforementioned hard tannins. Drink or hold through 2022.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dusty white-fruit aromas lead to a firm palate with fine acidity, minerality and a sense of completeness. Dry slightly spicy apple and peach flavors finish in elegant form. This is everyday Godello at its best, meaning no bells and whistles, just fruit, slate and acidity.",Spain,Godello
"Yellow in color, with heavy dusty flat aromas of apple and citrus, this feels low on acidity and thus flat. Cidery apple and lime flavors finish chunky and leesy with an oily texture.",Spain,Albariño
Dusty apple aromas come with a vanilla-like note of animal crackers. A plump but diluted palate shows mediocre wan flavors of nectarine and apple in front of a flat finish that's losing steam. Drink immediately or wait for a new vintage.,Spain,Albariño
"This is smelling a bit oxidized and wayward. Spritzy in feel, this blend of 70% Albariño, 15% Loureira and 15% Treixadura tastes pithy and like citrus skins. Pithy, borderline bitter flavors of white grapefruit drive the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"This blend of Viura and Malvasia is mild, low on aromatic punch and suggestive of saline solution. This is friendly but flat in feel, with modest structure. Leesy flavors of peach and apple finish chalky and grabby.",Spain,White Blend
"Waxy peach and apple aromas come with a leesy cookie-like component. This is 50% each Sauvignon Blanc and Garnacha Blanca, and it feels both plump and watery. Flavors of quince and apple are diluted and distant, while the finish is mild.",Spain,White Blend
"Fleshy aromas of melon and peach are leesy and soft. This is more angular and acidic on the palate, which fails to fan out. Nectarine and salty briny flavors finish with papaya and peach notes.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay
"At first, this black-colored Garnacha smells horsey and reduced, but with time it exudes more aromatic harmony and quality. A big tannic palate is rough like sandpaper. Blackberry, pepper and chocolate flavors don't rise to a level of excellence, while a heavy saturated finish closes out this muscular red.",Spain,Grenache
"Hard and charred on the nose at first, this sheds its tire-like aromas for cleaner berry-fruit notes with airing. A full grabby palate is a bit rough and awkward, while roasted berry, plum and oak flavors finish minty and resiny.",Spain,Tempranillo
"For Brut Nature, this has body and weight to it. The nose delivers dry apple and pear aromas, while the palate is fairly full and round for the style, with apple and lime flavors. A finish with roundness and density confirms this Cava's good quality.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Jammy, mildly green aromas of tobacco, cherry and blueberry shed clarity with airing. This blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet and Merlot is high in acid, a touch abrasive and hollow in the midpalate, with green-leaning, minty flavors of blackberry and plum. This finishes acidic, with some scour.",Spain,Red Blend
"The nose on this round, medium-bodied wine is defined by sweet oak and milk chocolate. In the mouth, it's chunky and ripe, with raw tannins. Flavors of sweet, pushy berry fruits and heavy oak lead to a toasty finish with carob and wood flavors. This is good but oak-dominated.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Of all the Cavas made by Freixenet, this oddly sweet Spumante is the weakest. This is briny, pickled and candied on the nose, with hints of lychee and banana. Flavors of Sprite, cane sugar and banana finish with sulfur, honeydew and a faux kiwi note.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Luscious prune and blackberry aromas come with complex notes of graphite, toast and tobacco. The palate on this 80-case, high-end Tinto Fino is about as full as they come while still maintaining impeccable balance. Roasted berry, cassis and salty leather flavors are delicious but also challenging, while baked berry flavors, raw power and ripe tannins define the finish. Drink this outstanding Spanish wine from 2014 through 2024.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"After two marginal vintages (2007–08), this is Emilio Moro and Ribera del Duero at their finest. This Tinto Fino delivers a huge wave of mocha, blackberry, tobacco and coffee aromas in front of a dense and layered palate that's packed with prune, chocolate, cassis and blackberry flavors. A savory, richly textured finish overflowing with coffee, chocolate and smoky flavors seals the deal. Drink from 2015–2022.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"This is the epitome of a dark, strapping, modern wine from an Old World region. Coffee, mocha and spicy yet smooth black-fruit aromas precede a rich, racy, agile feeling palate, with toasty flavors of berry fruits, licorice, mocha and espresso. Mint and licorice flavors combine with firm tannins and heat on the finish. Hold until 2015, then drink through 2023.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Dusty white-fruit aromas lead to a firm palate with fine acidity, minerality and a sense of completeness. Dry slightly spicy apple and peach flavors finish in elegant form. This is everyday Godello at its best, meaning no bells and whistles, just fruit, slate and acidity.",Spain,Godello
"Jammy blackberry aromas come with strong notes of creosote and asphalt but not much nuance. A saturated beefy mouthfeel and dark toasty black-fruit flavors are intense, while this tastes of chocolate and dark spices on a deep, pounding finish. Drink through 2024.",Spain,Red Blend
"An unclean nose smells cheesy. This is flabby and flat, with no acidity. Thus the flavors are sugary and soft, with no spunk. Overall, this struggles to keep up with what's on the market.",Spain,Shiraz-Tempranillo
"Gorgeous from head to toe, this saturated Toro heavyweight sets a new bar for this winery and the region as a whole. Ribald blackberry aromas are toasty and carry a strong note of crushed stones. Cassis, black plum and blackberry flavors are complex and inspired, while the finish tastes of chocolaty oak, blackened toast and a black-fruit potpourri supported by just the right amount of acidity. Drink from 2017–2030.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Lightly rusty in color, this outstanding gran reserva is just now entering its golden years, which should endure for another two decades or so. Aromas of raisin, malt, tobacco and cedar are beautiful. This is tight and sinewy in feel, with rooty, creamy, classic Rioja flavors of vanilla, tobacco and dried red fruits. A lasting, stout finish isn't breaking down at all; drink through 2040.",Spain,Red Blend
"Everything about this stately Ribera heavyweight impresses. The nose is outright oaky, so expect derivative aromas of toast, clove, cinnamon and spice to go with black-fruit scents. This remains firm, tannic and tightly wrapped, with massive blackberry, chocolate and toast flavors. Peppery spice, brooding mixed-berry flavors and mouth-coating tannins endow a finish that signals that this has many good years ahead of it. Drink from 2018–2032.",Spain,Tempranillo
"One look, one whiff, one taste and you're swooning. This mature, tawny, ready-to-drink gran reserva with aromas of lemon peel, cedar and dried cherry is the epitome of elegance. A juicy, supple palate is highly approachable, while flavors of vanilla, orange peel, saffron and dried plum don't waver on the finish. Drink through 2027.",Spain,Red Blend
"Like its big brother Alabaster, this is a superb Tinta de Toro that's powerfully built but also stylish. Aromas of cassis and blackberry are dark, malty and chocolaty. Flavors of burnt toast, dark chocolate, black peppercorn and blackberry end with a tannic yet balanced swirl of licorice and minerally complexity. Drink from 2017–2030.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Fleshy aromas of melon and peach are leesy and soft. This is more angular and acidic on the palate, which fails to fan out. Nectarine and salty briny flavors finish with papaya and peach notes.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay
"Green grassy aromas are modest and watery. This feels oily, but with decent acidity. Oxidized flavors of stone fruits finish wheaty, bland and eggy.",Spain,Tempranillo Blanco
"Apple and melon aromas are mild, straightforward and devoid of oak. A chunky melony palate doesn't have much stuffing, while this tastes of mild peach, papaya and other tropical fruits. Overall, this is inoffensive but hollow.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Orange peel aromas are a bit stony. In the mouth, this feels like it's past its prime, with little to no intensity or acidity. Mild apple flavors are sweet, mealy and honeyed, while the ending is leesy and mushy.",Spain,Albariño
"Leesy, creamy aromas of vanilla are simple, with a note of apple offering some crispness. The palate is regular in feel, with adequate acidity. Flavors of green apple, lettuce and herbs culminate with mild bitterness and green notes.",Spain,White Blend
"Leesy aromas of wheat and corn are low on fruit and general appeal. This feels regular at best. Grassy gaseous flavors of bitter melon, lime and apple finish leesy and uncommitted, with flabby weight. For whatever reason, this is below prior benchmarks.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"An oily bouquet lacks freshness while smelling a bit oxidized and like mushrooms. This has a chunky palate with oxidized, somewhat bitter flavors of papaya and citrus fruits. A pithy mildly bitter finish struggles to show its virtues.",Spain,Albariño
"A light tan color and dusty sweaty aromas of apricot, matchstick and onion set up a clampy, pithy, citrusy palate. Flavors of nectarine and orange are mild, low on stuffing and grabby on the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Fleshy, unfocused aromas of apple and peach are a touch oxidized. This Chardonnay feels bland. Flavors of melon and peach lack tension and character, while there's not much flavor to the finish other than mild apple and some bitterness.",Spain,Chardonnay
"This Montsant white is oily and oaky on the nose. The palate on this Garnacha Blanca is plump feeling, with decent acidity and full flavors of papaya and melon. This finishes oily in feel, with green notes and scallion flavors. Only 500 cases made.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"The overriding character of this basic Rioja is raisiny, ripe berry fruit; it's on the nose, palate and finish. Alongside these notes are mild tannins, some rubbery weight and chunky friendliness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Oxidized, stemmy aromas suggest a stalky, burnt-out wine. Things are slightly better in the mouth, where the feel is narrow and the flavors are bitter, stalky and hint at peach pit and citrus peel. This is hollow on the finish but lively in feel.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"The last Altos that was this good came in 2004; this vintage is on a par with that superb wine courtesy of deep plum, mocha and marzipan aromas. This is a modern Rioja with impeccable balance despite being huge and tannic. Flavors of cassis, black cherry and dark plum operate off a mocha base, while the finish is toasty and chocolaty, with a note of black coffee. Best from 2015–2024.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This gorgeous dessert wine shows a coffee-colored tint that's backed by lush, deep aromas of fig, caramel, toffee and prune. The palate shows weight but a refined mouthfeel that's not sticky or heavy. Flavors of coffee, mocha, chocolate, caramel, peanut brittle and prune finish warm and long. Only 43 cases made.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Tightly wound, layered, moderately tannic and oozing excellence, this is a fantastic high-end Toro from the superb 2012 vintage. The minerally, toasty aroma of blackberry is stylish and shows a balsamic note. Flavors of licorice, sweet balsamic vinegar, chocolate and toasty blackberry continue on a long, deep, complex finish. Drink this ace-level red from 2017–2028.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Powerful berry and spice aromas open this jammy slightly heavy Monastell. Desert-herb notes of sage and thyme accent a core blueberry flavor, while this tastes of carob, roasted beet and toast on the finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"Stalky aromas of corn, apple and white flowers lack focus. This feels blocky, while salty flavors of cured ham blend with leesy flavors of papaya and peach. A moderate basic finish is par for the course.",Spain,White Blend
"A gaseous smelling nose and a chunky palate are not motivational, while flavors of banana and melon aren't much better. Overall, this is a basic Verdejo that's starting to fade.",Spain,Verdejo
"Offering a flat opening with no kick, it is akin to sniffing apple juice. This is plump and wan in feel, with melon and banana flavors, while a soft, no-edge finish doesn't leave much of a lasting impression.",Spain,Verdejo
"Melon and cidery aromas are distant. This feels low on acidity, while pear, papaya and briny flavors taste bitter on the back end of the palate. A briny, pickled note marks the finish.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Nothing on the bottle says this is oaked, but this Albariño smells like burnt plywood and sawdust. It's chunky and fat on the palate, with woody melony flavors that finish salty and dried out.",Spain,Albariño
"Mature mealy apricot aromas lead to a spent palate with unfocused cidery flavors that taste old and demanding. This finishes heavy, pulpy and without much point or pleasure. Albariño is meant to be fresh and friendly, but this is neither.",Spain,Albariño
"Leesy aromas of tropical fruits feed into a flat palate. Leesy but bland peach and melon flavors lack conviction and finish sketchy, with nothing in particular standing out. This is the definition of a marginal Cava.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Lightly roasted and stalky on the nose, this shows dry aromas of cherry and raspberry along with earthy spice notes. The palate offers proper balance and nothing complicated. Flavors of oak-driven spice, cinnamon and pepper accent earthy plum and berry, while the finish is smooth but a touch hot. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Red Blend
"Lactic, creamy oak brings overt aromas of vanilla, shoe polish and graphite along with Ribera del Duero's requisite black-fruit scents. This is jammy and heavy on the palate, with hard tannins. Flavors of blackened, spicy berry fruits, espresso, bitter chocolate and stewed blackberry finish gritty and with flavors of prune, licorice and mocha. Best from 2015 through 2021.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"This is one fruity, loaded red. Aromas of boysenberry, violet petals, latex and generic medicinality set up a round, full-bodied but balanced palate. Flavors of ultraripe black fruits, blueberry and herbs finish long, moderately spicy and a touch herbal. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Red Blend
"Intense, heady cherry and blackberry aromas are minerally on one hand and sweet like marzipan on the other. This textbook Garnacha-Carignan blend is tight on the palate, with live-wire berry, plum, earth and mineral flavors. Only on the finish does a touch of raisiny richness rise up; drink through 2017.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stalky, mildly green aromas of grass, blueberry and raisin are challenging but not offputting. This is tight and fairly acidic for a La Mancha blend of Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Flavors of herbal berry and stewed fruits end with a baked character and heat.",Spain,Red Blend
"With can't-miss aromas of vanilla, dill and leathery cherry, this starts out in textbook form for a Rioja crianza. The palate is just round enough, with initial dark-berry flavors followed by numerous waves of bold oak that finish in a pool of dill, mint and spice flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This Valencia blend opens with aromas of latex, Band-Aid and jammy red-berry fruits. It's wide in the mouth, with a mix of buttery oak, herbal berry and minty plum flavors. This is good but shows a distinct green side on the palate and finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark berry aromas of all sorts, particularly cassis and blackberry, rest comfortably in front of a fresh, long, slightly acidic palate that is home to flavors of raspberry, plum and licorice. This is more fresh and lively than many top-flight Ribera del Duero wines, with crisp finishing acidity and firm tannins. Drink from 2014 through 2022.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Nothing but excellence emanates from the nose of this cool, crisp, focused Tempranillo. The mouthfeel is currently young and tannic, but the wine's structure is just right and its future is bright. Flavors of licorice, spice and blackberry lead to a lively finish with flavors of mocha, chocolate and fine herbs. Best from 2014–2024.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dense leather, cola and wild berry aromas comprise the bouquet on this massive, layered, suprememly rich Tempranillo. Core blackberry, cassis and blueberry flavors are incredibly ripe, while chocolate and prune flavors carry the finish. This is a thick, dense wine squarely made in the modern style. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Typical of the best 2009 Riojas, this is aromatic with scents of berry fruits, graphite and spice all mixed to the right proportions. A well-structured palate features firm but flexible tannins and fresh flavors of plum, berry, spice and mocha. On the finish, darkness takes over in the form of espresso, peppercorn and bitter chocolate flavors. This can be drunk now but will benefit from another 5–10 years of aging.",Spain,Red Blend
"Of all the Atauta single-vineyard wines from the sensational 2011 vintage, La Mala is arguably the most overtly oaky and modern in style. Grainy, resiny barrel-driven aromas come with controlled burn and heat. This is tannic and firm as cement, with ample oak resin creating a creamy feel. Resiny, fully spiced black-fruit flavors end with pepper, wood grain, burnt toast and other oaky notes. Drink from 2018–2031.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"A light-pink color is backed by a simple nose that's nondescript but fresh and clean. A slightly foamy but firm palate isn't all that deep or rich, while mild grapefruit and blood orange flavors finish steady.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A potpourri of floral red-fruit, dried herb and wet cement aromas lead to a racy fresh palate that's mildly complex. Oaky red-berry flavors come with a note of chocolate, while this tastes lightly herbal on a lasting well-formed finish. Drink this Carignan-Garnacha through 2021.",Spain,Cariñena-Garnacha
"Aromas of cherry, plum, forest floor and tobacco feed into a clampy palate with fresh acidity. Lightly spiced currant and red-plum flavors are limited in scope but nice, while this tastes herbal and feels tight and racy on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"An initial blast of butter and sweaty cheese settles with airing, but this amontillado remains aggressive and demanding up front. In the mouth, this is correct in feel and balance. Saline-rich flavors of walnut, peanut and mushroom finish steady.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Leafy gritty earthy berry aromas are spicy. This feels rugged but fresh, with a tolerable but strong tannic grip. Plum, boysenberry, chocolate, blackened toast and peppercorn flavors finish leafy, with firm tannins.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Typically dark in color, with plum, blackberry and a touch of raisin on the nose, this feels a bit jammy, with a shock of acidity and hard tannins. Prune, baked plum and baking-spice flavors finish toasty and charred, with dry rough tannins. Drink through 2025.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Melon, apple and peach pit aromas are dusty but that's about it. This feels flat, with little acidity or kick. Flavors of peach and apple cider end similarly, with no vitality to the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Aromas of canned peas and beans indicate this was probably fresher smelling nine months ago. Zesty and solid on the palate, this tastes oily, pyrazinic and briny, with stone fruit notes.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Extreme raisiny aromas are suggestive of P.X. Sherry. This is heavy and grabby on the palate while prune and raisin flavors are dominant. On the finish, this is overripe and ponderous, with fig and prune flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Murky mucky passion fruit and pineapple aromas are uncommon and uninviting. This feels watery and a bit citrusy, while strained mango and passion fruit flavors end bitter, pithy and lean.",Spain,Albariño
"Stalky and foul on the nose, this Chardonnay doesn't smell inviting. Oily and heavy on the palate, this tastes of resiny oak, related cream and bland white fruits.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Mild peach and quince aromas come with zero zest or edge. This lacks shape on the palate and tastes jumbled, with bland peach and tropical fruit flavors. This finishes flat as a board, with almost no lasting flavor.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Yeasty, dusty aromas of apple and melon lead to a plump, almost flat feeling palate with generic flavors of peach, apple and melon. The finish has a soft, mealy, slightly creamy and flat feel along with modest flavors of white fruits.",Spain,Viura
"Raw, rooty, scratchy aromas that suggest clove and licorice set up a tight, drawing, tannic palate with herbal, leathery, dark flavors of wild berry and bitter chocolate. Mint, a strong clove characteristic and dark fruit flavors control the finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"The bouquet on this white blend almost goes in reverse, meaning it's so neutral that it seems to go backwards. In the mouth, the wine is fleshy and soft, with flabby flavors of banana, papaya and bland citrus. A sugary tasting finish with pear and banana is o.k. but cloying.",Spain,White Blend
"This three-grape white blend starts with oily aromas and weight before finding some minerality and white-fruit notes. The palate has citrusy kick and zing to bolster green apple and orange flavors. The finish is wide, a touch clumsy and citrusy in flavor, with tang and lasting freshness.",Spain,White Blend
"This white Garnacha starts with a salinic nose that contains aromas of pear, papaya, salami and ham. It's a little flabby on the palate, with pithy, oily flavors of papaya, melon, lychee and salt. There's mild bitterness to the finish, but not enough to sink the wine.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Initially, this smells damp and earthy, although with airing a mix of leather, berry fruits and vanilla emerge. The palate is bumpy and borderline sticky feeling, with baked, earthy flavors of black fruits and herbal tones. The finish is short and tastes a little raisiny.",Spain,Carignan-Grenache
"Talk about a ripped, structured wine that could use more rest. This pumps out minerally blackberry and coconut aromas along with raw, inky intensity. The wine's texture is defined by a strong tannic backbone, while flavors of burnt toast, bacon, licorice and black fruits finish with graphite and energy. Drink from 2015–2023.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This dense wine from Bierzo is rich, chocolaty and reticent in its delivery of black-fruit aromas. The round, pure palate is rich and easy to like, while flavors of baked berry, earth and chocolate lead to a chewy, round finish that's friendly but structured and substantive. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Mencía
"Among a small population of varietal Spanish Cabernets, Pago Valdebellón is exemplary. Bold plum and cassis aromas come with a needling of green notes and spice. In the mouth, this is tight and tannic, but not angry. Flavors of herbal raspberry come with a minty aftertaste, while the finish is lively and herbal, with a touch of heat. Drink now through 2020.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Deep berry and mocha aromas form a red-carpet opening that's topped off by chocolate and earth. And while this is a bit soft and jammy on the tongue, there's enough structure to support baked, rich, black-fruit flavors and dark spice notes. A finish full of mossy notes, prune and mellow tannins says drink this wine now through 2015.",Spain,Mencía
"This dark, exotic blend of Carignan, Grenache and Syrah is impressive given that 2008 wasn't a good year in Spain. This shows integrated oak, graphite and inky aromas in front of a full, balanced palate that's home to berry flavors, schisty minerality and mocha accents. A generous finish with plum and berry flavors as well as licorice is the right ending. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Red Blend
"Floral soupy plum aromas come with notes of road tar, violet, lavender and grass. This has a jammy, saturated, chunky mouthfeel to go with plum and spiced-berry flavors.

"Black-fruit aromas include overripe prune along with herbal hints. In the mouth, this Syrah-Merlot-Cabernet blend is pulling and tannic. Toasty oak, blackberry and barrel-based spice flavors finish dry as a bone, with roughness. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Red Blend
"Complex aromas of olive, dried leaves, kirsch and cassis set up a spunky, acid-rich palate that's integrated and well balanced. Flavors of vanilla, herbs, tobacco and earthy plum and raspberry finish with elegance and thoroughness. This intense, pure gran reserva will age well for another 15 years, maybe longer.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lush prune and raisin aromas stop short of being mushy and make way for fresher notes of black currant and toast. Saturated, dense and chewy on the palate, this tastes ripe and toasty, with hefty blackberry and chocolate flavors. Additional toastiness and peppery spice flavors work the finish on this generous Tempranillo from an excellent vintage. Drink from 2017–2030.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"This is the best wine from Liberalia we've reviewed to date. Jammy blackberry, wild raspberry and licorice aromas are controlled but potent. Flush, dense and wide on the palate, this features manageable tannins along with pure blackberry and cassis flavors touched up by toasty oak. Espresso and burnt toast notes take over on the finish as the fruit slips away. Drink through 2030.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Spicy plum and berry aromas are slightly earthy and on the money. This feels full and plump, but well balanced. Spicy dry plum and berry flavors are limited but focused, while this offers a vanilla note on a finish that fades out slow and easy. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Woody plum and berry aromas are a bit more raw and angular than in past vintages. This feels abnormally bright and lively for Paixar, which is normally a dark full-bodied type of Mencía. Flavors of baked black plum and oaky coconut finish toasty and long, but low on fruit. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Mencía
"Aromas of sweet oak and maple announce that this Mencía received generous barrel treatment. Supple in feel, this tastes of oaky plum and raspberry along with a dash of salt. Jammy berry notes and a hint of Graham cracker rise up on the finish. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Mencía
"Mild peach and quince aromas come with zero zest or edge. This lacks shape on the palate and tastes jumbled, with bland peach and tropical fruit flavors. This finishes flat as a board, with almost no lasting flavor.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Reduced medicinal raspberry and cherry aromas are more like fruit juice than wine. This is choppy and off the mark in mouthfeel, while unfamiliar jumbled flavors of jammy red berry fruits finish tannic and green.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is an underripe stench bomb with pyrazines coming at you from every direction. The nose is like a bowl of cactus and nettle, while the palate is harsh. Flavors of bitter pithy grapefruit show all that can go wrong with this variety.",Spain,Verdejo
"Strange yeasty unfocused aromas are unclean. This is flat and spineless, with yeasty papaya flavors. A diluted, leesy finish confirms that it's not ready for prime time.",Spain,Chardonnay
"This is a heartbeat or two from being DOA. Tan in color with an oily heavy mouthfeel, this tastes oxidized and shows almost no pulse.",Spain,Verdejo
"Savory aromas of cumin and clove are oak-based but nice, and there's plenty of black fruit and minerality in the background. This feels round and right, while oaky notes of hickory and vanilla accent ripe, raisiny berry flavors. A mild, easy finish with vanilla and herb notes closes this out. Drink  through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Toasty popcorn aromas are pitched against dry white-fruit scents. This has a good, pure feel to the palate, while flavors of bright apple, lime, white grapefruit and ocean brine finish crisp and mildly salty. This is a complex brut nature made entirely from Xarel-lo. 250 cases made.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"A waxy nose with aromas of dried pit fruits including apricot is more stalky smelling than overtly fruity. A grabby mouthfeel shows weight and waxiness, while stalky, baked flavors of squash, pumpkin and papaya finish with a touch of oxidation. Drink now before this loses its vitality.",Spain,Godello
"Slightly mealy smelling citrus aromas are offset by an Animal Cracker-like vanilla scent. The palate is melony and plump, with candied lime, Yellow Delicious apple and powdered sugar flavors. This finishes soft but not flabby.",Spain,Verdejo
"Fruity but also showing saddle, game and vanilla aromas, this reserva from a top vintage sees its whole exceeding the sum of its parts. Full and creamy on the palate, this tastes of barrel toast and earthy plum and berry. Smooth and impressive, this is as welcoming as it is complex and age-worthy. Drink through 2025.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Gritty, charred aromas rest on top of core blackberry and cassis scents. This is a blocky, stout number with firm tannins and serious structure. Charred blackberry and dark chocolate are the lead flavors, while this big-boned Toro tastes of toast and mocha on the finish, which is drying and tannic. Drink through 2027.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe plum and berry aromas with a note of vanilla are highly encouraging. Hailing from a warm vintage, this 10-year-old Bierzo beauty offers a blend of pulpy ripeness with bracing acidity. Loamy plum, oak and vanilla flavors end with length and elegance. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Mencía
"For a tight, snappy rendition of Rioja, this answers the call. Herbal plum and tomato aromas are earthy and a touch horsey. Tomato, plum and herbal flavors amount to a saucy whole, while this is fresh, herbal and brothy tasting on a crisp finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe raisin and black-fruit aromas come with a licorice sidenote. This feels tight and pure but not demanding, with proper balance. Plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors give way to a spongy fruit-driven finish.",Spain,Mencía
"A bready, yeasty nose announces that this brut nature is more than ready to drink. In the mouth, it's smooth, but light on verve and bubbles. Oxidized flavors of spent yeast, bread dough and sautéed mushroom finish dry and reserved, but somewhat flat. Drink now.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Earthy and a touch gritty smelling on first take, this gets riper, cleaner and better the longer it catches air. A full slightly tannic palate is mildly abrasive, while tea, herbal berry and chocolaty oak flavors are appealing. A spicy peppery chocolaty finish is not shedding its drying tannins. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raspberry, chocolate and plum aromas form a basic bouquet. This shows tight grip along with flavors of baked berry fruits, leather and earth. The finish tastes a bit rubbery, and then heat and dry, peppery notes take over.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Light aromas of red plum and raspberry lead to a wiry, snappy feeling palate with a mix of raspberry, plum and cocoa powder flavors. This is a lean, juicy Tempranillo with modest character and a clean finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The nose on this clear-colored Godello is fresh, spunky and citrusy. The palate is spritzy in feel and juicy, but also kind of cloying and clumsy. Flavors of sweet apple, citrus, lychee and mango finish tropical and candied, with weight and flatness.",Spain,Godello
"Grassy berry and light, leafy aromas define the bouquet. The mouth is a little tangy but mostly jammy, while blueberry, lemony oak and dilution define the flavor profile. A short, choppy, jammy finish comes across slightly washed out.",Spain,Garnacha
"For a tight, snappy rendition of Rioja, this answers the call. Herbal plum and tomato aromas are earthy and a touch horsey. Tomato, plum and herbal flavors amount to a saucy whole, while this is fresh, herbal and brothy tasting on a crisp finish.",Spain,Tempranillo

The palate is concentrated and juicy, with fine balance and bold flavors of blueberry, blackberry and coffee. A toasty, dark finish features chocolate, toast and minerality. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Carignan-Grenache
"Oaky, inky, modern and full of power, this Montsant blend of Carignan, Syrah and Garnacha is toasty and dark as night on the bouquet. The palate feels ripe and intense, with creamy oak and controlled tannins. Flavors of baked black fruits, cocoa and vanilla finish soft and supple, with just enough tannic grip and acidity to maintain focus. Drink from 2014–2020.",Spain,Red Blend
"The pride of Peique, this warm-vintage Bierzo is power-charged on the nose, with smoky, woody aromas of baked berry fruits. Layered, intense, chewy and integrated on the palate, this Mencía tastes like licorice and baking spices blended with black cherry and plum. The finish is dark and full, but lively. Drink through 2021.",Spain,Mencía
"This Tempranillo looks and smells ripe, and it's loaded with toasty minty oak aromas. In the mouth, this woody number is pushy and tannic. Barrel-driven flavors of smoky charred black plum are one-dimensional. This finishes tannic and with pounding oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Neutral, slightly briny aromas are fresh but low on fruit. This has a slightly plump feel but not a lot of length or depth. Short basic white-fruit flavors match the nose, while this Xarello finishes dry in feel and mildly briny in flavor.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"Simple green-apple aromas are innocuous. This is fresh, easy and light on the palate. Flavors of apple and sweet greens finish mild and clean. Overall this wins by keeping things basic and fresh.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"Earthy and a touch gritty smelling on first take, this gets riper, cleaner and better the longer it catches air. A full slightly tannic palate is mildly abrasive, while tea, herbal berry and chocolaty oak flavors are appealing. A spicy peppery chocolaty finish is not shedding its drying tannins. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Classic Rioja aromas of berry fruits, spice, tobacco and vanilla lead to a grabby palate that's slightly bumpy in feel. Dry spicy plum and berry flavors are lightly herbal, while the finish tastes the same.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Although this Carignan-Garnacha blend smells gritty and not as ripe as vintages like 2012 and 2011, it is fresh and full in feel, with grippy tannins. Flavors of blackened spice, plum and berry fruits finish full, fleshy and a touch hot. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Cariñena-Garnacha
"This Tempranillo looks and smells ripe, and it's loaded with toasty minty oak aromas. In the mouth, this woody number is pushy and tannic. Barrel-driven flavors of smoky charred black plum are one-dimensional. This finishes tannic and with pounding oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This Garnacha-Tempranillo blend opens with candied plum and berry aromas. On the palate, this feels sticky, jammy and a touch gummy. Plum and candied-berry flavors are ripe and fun, but rudimentary. A mild finish confirms that this is good but basic stuff.",Spain,Garnacha-Tempranillo
"Berry and earth aromas open with a touch of horseradish that blows off with time. This Bobal is drawing and dry on the palate, with fresh acidity. Savory berry and tomato flavors finish with scratchy tannins.",Spain,Bobal

"Earthy baked cherry aromas come across candied and minty. The palate is full-force in terms of acidity, with punchy flavors of strawberry and plum. This finishes light, with strong acidity pushing snappy tartness to the fore.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The nose on this Grenache Blanc is oily smelling and blowsy. In the mouth, it's fairly tangy and angular, with fresh acids and briny, pickled flavors of lime and orange. Cornichon-like flavors and wiry acidity control the finish.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Simple strawberry aromas come with stalky side notes. In the mouth, this is tannic while also coming across syrupy. Baked flavors of molasses, stewed plum and nutmeg end in a syrupy, cooked finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mild, fleshy aromas of dusty white fruits lead to a clenched, acidic palate with citrus and nectarine flavors. The finish shows little deviation and nothing more than basic white-fruit flavors of citrus, peach and apple.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Rubbery, leathery aromas of minerally berry and raisin set up a tight, well-structured palate with bracing tannins. Fully ripe flavors of dark fruits and minerals finish warm and a bit baked, with a firm, proper feel. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Red Blend
"Excellent Rioja wines were few and far between in 2008, so this high-end offering deserves credit. Aromas of minerally black fruits are piercing and show some alcohol. The palate is condensed but vital, with ample richness. Toasty, black flavors of licorice, blackberry and mocha finish with a blast of saline and burnt toast. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Minerally aromas of boysenberry and red currant are fruity and direct. Like its younger brother, Vinyes Velles, this is racy, tangy and strictly structured. Flavors of wild berry come with schisty minerality and some oak, while the finish is nervy, energetic and shearing. As a pair, the 2010s are Ferrer Bobet's most angular wines to date.",Spain,Carignan
"It's almost absurd how good this $9 Tempranillo is. Full, clean, deep aromas of black fruits and licorice feed into an energetic yet generous palate with moderate richness. Flavors of black cherry, blackberry and pepper finish spicy but not pushy. What a deal!",Spain,Tempranillo
"Loamy, earthy blackberry and plum aromas are woody and attractive. This is loud and lively on the palate, with acidity and tannins making their presence felt. Blackberry and baked plum are the key flavors, and this finishes loamy and smooth. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Toasty aromas include popcorn, scrambled egg and briny white fruits. There's smoothness to the ripe palate, while apple, peach and citrus flavors—the Big Three of cava—finish fruity and with stuffing. This is a ripe winner that's richer and more flavorful than your average brut nature.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is a particular style of Albariño. Aromas of white flowers distant mineral and green melon set up a plump, layered palate, with core acidity but also flatness that will only increase the longer it goes. Flavors of nectarine, orange and melon register as citric but also creamy. This is a unique Galician white that's stylish but won't last forever; drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"Beronia has blended modern and traditional touches to create a fine gran reserva with spice, vanilla, coconut, tobacco and dried berry aromas. The palate offers ripe tannins and kick, while the flavor profile is earthy, with mocha, coffee, chocolate and dried berry flavors. A long, lightly toasted and chocolaty finish provides a fitting end to an excellent wine. Best from 2015–2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A wine made from dried Moscatel with Sherry characteristics? This is that and more. Aromas of raisin, cinnamon, flowers and caramel are particular for dessert wines. In the mouth, this is fresh and juicy but substantive, with caramel, toffee, coffee and spice flavors running onto a long finish with toffee and chocolate notes. This is ripe and sweet but balanced and delicious.",Spain,Sherry
"Initially this Rioja seems topped by gritty aromas of tire rubber and burnt leaves, but with airing it gets more earthy and presentable. Tight tannins and a firm structure are the greeting on the palate, while flavors of stewed berries, herbs and oak take things to a warm, lightly baked finish with balance and length. The more this wine breathes, the better it shows. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Red Blend
"Blackberry aromas are touched up by graphite, char and herbal accents. This feels wide, with wall-to-wall tannins and extracted flavors of loam and earthy plum and blackberry. A lead-pencil note is reprised on the finish, which is tannic in feel and loaded with herbal black-fruit character.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Classic Rioja aromas of berry fruits, spice, tobacco and vanilla lead to a grabby palate that's slightly bumpy in feel. Dry spicy plum and berry flavors are lightly herbal, while the finish tastes the same.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Although this Carignan-Garnacha blend smells gritty and not as ripe as vintages like 2012 and 2011, it is fresh and full in feel, with grippy tannins. Flavors of blackened spice, plum and berry fruits finish full, fleshy and a touch hot. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Cariñena-Garnacha
"Heavy oak, asphalt, chocolate and slightly weedy berry aromas open this blend of Garnacha Tintorera, Monastrell and Syrah. In the mouth, rubbery tannins create astringency. Fully oaked, spicy berry flavors include vanilla and clove notes, while an oak-dominated finish tastes creamy and herbal.",Spain,Red Blend
"Flowery aromas suggest air freshener. This feels plump, round and oily. Salty orange flavors are just ripe enough to be good, while this pushes the limits of brininess on a finish that offers a taste of the ocean.",Spain,Albariño
"The nose on this Cava from Ribera del Duero is chunky and yeasty. In the mouth, the wine foams up while showing flavors of orange, lemon and minerals. It's a touch sour on the finish, but overall it smells and tastes good, with little to no complexity.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Smoky, roasted, leathery aromas of black fruits are slightly stalky and show a lemony edge. This is tight as a drum and hard on the palate, with lots of oak, vanilla, herb, raspberry and currant flavors. A dry, firm, oaky finish with intensity and structure closes things out.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Mature, ripe aromas of raisin, caramel, tobacco and fine oak form a pleasing, inviting bouquet. Drawing, edgy and still quite tannic in feel, this tastes rooty, baked and lightly stewed, with just enough berry and plum fruit to prop things up. On the finish, chocolate, prune and baked notes of pastry and cake are potent and delicious. Drink through 2027.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Smoky, toasty oak aromas are dominant on a black-fruit bouquet that also shows graphite. This is saturated and tight, with complexity and outright deliciousness of savory, meaty, spicy blackberry flavors. Toast, cured beef and cocoa flavors prove that there's more to this than just heft and oak. Best from 2019 through 2032.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A big oaky can't-miss blast of clove and wood spice is more dominating than secondary berry aromas. This is resiny and full in body, with ample acidity. Oak plays a lead role on the flavor profile, which includes toast, mint and herbal black plum. A peppery toasty finish benefits from moderate juicy acidity. Drink through 2021.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rubber, Band-Aid and leathery red-fruit aromas open this blend of Garnacha, Carignan and Syrah. In the mouth, this is blocky and collapsed. Roasted plum and berry flavors carry a medicinal note, while this is chewy and tastes lightly herbal on a tannic, weighty finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Slightly rubbery black cherry and blackberry aromas are generic but good. This feels round and easygoing, with soft tannins and modest acidity. Black-plum flavors fly solo, while this is nice but hollow on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Mencía
"No two ways about it, this hot-vintage Gran Reserva is a plush wine. It starts with baked cooked stewed aromas that render the nose asleep. A soupy stewy palate tastes of baked berry fruits, prune and chocolate. Consistent with the rest of the wine, this finishes soft. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Fleshy apple and peach aromas lead to a medium-bodied palate. Standard flavors of stone fruits are nice but simple, while this blend of Viura and Malvasia finishes with light notes of apple and nectarine.",Spain,White Blend
"This wine is about as raisiny as it gets while still holding onto a sense of balance. Aromas of stewed berry fruits, prune and carob lead to a grabby, lemony tasting palate with raisin, vanilla and sweet tobacco on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"This opens with vanilla and sweet, powdery aromas. In the mouth, it's bubbly and foamy, with a mix of pickled citrus and dry apple flavors. The finish is crisp and dry like a soda cracker.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Raw aromas of rhubarb and scratchy raspberry offer little to latch onto. The palate feels clipped and angular, while the flavors are a touch stalky and generic as far as red fruit goes. This finishes tangy and scouring.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With its day-glo pink color, this smells stalky and lacks the aromatic freshness one seeks in rosé. The mouthfeel is reasonably lively and grabby, with briny, pickled citrus flavors in front of a briny tasting finish.",Spain,Rosé
"Medicinal cherry and plum aromas are smothered in milk chocolate scents that turn more animal and leathery with airing. The palate is chunky but dull in feel, with generic red-berry flavors covered with candied oak and herbal notes.",Spain,Monastrell
"With almost no color, this spritzy rosado is prickly and feline on the nose, like Sauvignon Blanc or Verdejo. The palate is lightly bubbly, with bounce and tart tangerine and herbal flavors. Txomin Etxaníz has never made a commercial rosé prior to this. This makes you wonder why they did.",Spain,Rosé
"A wide, open bouquet is home to aromas of tree bark, toast, stewed black fruits, herbs and spice. This is big but well built, with muscular, scraping tannins. Earthy, saucy flavors of berry and plum finish with notes of chocolate, sea salt, herbs and leather. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy, damp aromas suggest compost but there's enough fresh black-fruit character to keep the bouquet balanced. This feels dense, saturated and heavy, with a syrupy leaning and full tannins. Flavors of baked blackberry and vanilla end a little stewy and soft. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Earth, moss, vanilla and oak aromas accent blackberry and dark plum scents. This is grabby, firm and just rich enough, with earthy, toasty flavors of black plum and blackberry blended with herbs. A long, layered, level finish carries smacking tannins as well as freshness. Drink through 2015.",Spain,Mencía
"Blueberry, rubber and mint are the key aromas on what amounts to a linear, narrow nose. This Tempranillo-led blend is juicy and fresh in feel as opposed to thick and heavy. Flavors of plum, mint and peppery spice set up a finish that flashes by with light herbal aftershocks and not much more.",Spain,Red Blend
"Talk about a consistent wine. The past four vintages of 4 Varietales have all scored 91 points. This version opens with dense, jammy blackberry and raspberry aromas. The mouthfeel is healthy and full of tannic grip, while flavors of blackberry, prune, mocha and tobacco set up a chewy finish with rubbery tannins and length. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Red Blend
"Immediately this presents itself in a positive light. The color is bright and lucid, the nose is solid and smells clean and lush, and the body is full, stout and smacks firmly with proper tannin-acid balance. Flavors of peppery, chocolaty black fruits finish toasty, peppery and thorough.",Spain,Red Blend
"Ripe berry aromas are a bit raisiny, with vanilla and balsam wood notes. This Tempranillo feels blocky, saturated and tannic. Flavors of raisin, prune, blackberry and wood spice are full and bullish, while a boundary-pushing finish maintains a palpable raisiny quality. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fleshy apple and peach aromas lead to a medium-bodied palate. Standard flavors of stone fruits are nice but simple, while this blend of Viura and Malvasia finishes with light notes of apple and nectarine.",Spain,White Blend
"A somewhat flat baked jammy nose offers up a helping dose of oak spice. This feels chunky but largely healthy, while oaky minty flavors of berry fruits and plum show a tomato-like quality on a blocky finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Clean direct melon and tropical-fruit aromas are simple but nice. This feels light and fresh, without much weight or body. Melon and white-fruit flavors are a touch bready, while this is dry, fresh and not that fruity on the finish.",Spain,Xarel-lo
Initial aromas of chlorine and raw plum settle and become more fruity and attractive with airing. This shows a forward fresh sassy palate with clipped rugged tannins. Ample oak and salty berry flavors veer towards clove and cinnamon prior to a scraping tough finish.,Spain,Garnacha
"Light aromas of mango, melon and lime are quiet but clean. This is a simple but fresh white with a crisp stony mouthfeel. Easygoing flavors of melon and apple finish with a note of lime as well as a hint of wheaty yeast.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"Aromas of stewed berry fruits and damp leaves lack freshness but are not spoiled. This Garnacha-based blend feels thick and resiny, almost to the point of syrupy. Creamy oaky stewed berry flavors finish with an herbal hint and sticky tannins.",Spain,Red Blend
"Raisin, maple and vanilla aromas are derived from borderline overripe raw materials and 24 months in barrel. A hard palate pulls downward with massive tannins. Baked berry and chocolaty oak flavors finish with notes of berry pie and raisin.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is more brown than burnished gold in color, while it smells of toffee, brandy and maple syrup. Salty caramel and peanut flavors finish like a peanut butter cookie bathed in salt. While this definitely works, it's not registering as the outstanding Sherry the price and packaging would suggest.",Spain,Palomino
"This is waxy on the nose, with the aromatic spunk of nettle and sweaty citrus. It feels fresh, minerally and zesty, with citrus, apple and green herb flavors. It's solid, smooth and elegant on the finish, which turns slightly bitter as it concludes.",Spain,Verdejo
"This is a little heavy and oily on the nose, with blowsy white-fruit aromas. It feels peachy and smooth, with key flavor components of melon, apple and pear. This shows some extra heft, ending with a subtle and smooth finish.",Spain,Albariño
"This is deep, lush and earthy on the nose, with tobacco, broad spice aromas and fair but generous oak. It feels tight and balanced, with toasty, peppery flavors of cassis and black cherry. It's long, toasty and chocolaty on the finish, with layered spice accents. Drink now through 2016.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Slightly rusty in color and ready to drink, this lovely blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot conveys a lightly roasted bouquet, with cigar box, earth notes and tons of berry fruit. It feels rich but lively, with sweet black-fruit flavors, cocoa, mocha and licorice. This is toasty and chocolaty on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Dark and baked on the nose, with rubbery aromas. Strong, strapping and tannic Tempranillo with roasted black fruit flavors and herbal shadings. A rough, tough style with heat and black coffee on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells like air freshener and white flowers. The palate is spongey and a bit low on life, while the flavors lean toward citrus but lack purity and zap, which is further drilled in on the waxy finish. Once upon a time Basa was a leading white value from Spain; lately it has been average at best.",Spain,White Blend
"Opens with pasty, oaky aromas and very little fruit or clarity. The palate is flat in feel and thick, with woody, medicinal flavors. Finishes with a pile of woodspice and not a whole lot else. Generic and uninspired for the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light on fruit but loaded with mocha and milk chocolate aromas. The palate is lean to average in feel and lightly stewed tasting, with creamy, soupy red berry flavors as the backdrop. Finishes with a persistent baked   flavor and a final dollop of milk chocolate.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is more brown than burnished gold in color, while it smells of toffee, brandy and maple syrup. Salty caramel and peanut flavors finish like a peanut butter cookie bathed in salt. While this definitely works, it's not registering as the outstanding Sherry the price and packaging would suggest.",Spain,Palomino
"Gritty cassis aromas are oaky and challenging, which is what you can get when a wine spends more than three years in oak. In the mouth, this is wiry and rubbery. Foxy plum and cherry flavors finish clampy and herbal. Very good but with a few holes and pitfalls.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Gritty earthy aromas come up short on freshness and clarity. This feels raw and pinching, with dry rubbing tannins. Gritty peppery berry flavors are oaky, while this finishes with savory berry, herb and tobacco flavors. Hammering tannins suggest decanting and/or service with hearty foods.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A dark color and chunky aromas of black plum and animal hide set up a full tannic, rubbery palate. Herbal salty notes accent core plum and berry flavors, while this is long on the finish, with earthy notes and a sauvage hint of garrigue.",Spain,Carignan-Grenache
"This is leathery and earthy up front, with cherry and berry aromas that come with a flower accent. It feels snappy, alert and slightly citrusy, with raspberry, red plum and vanilla flavors. It's relatively short and choppy on the finish, but it's fresh, with the proper amount of oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big, smoky and concentrated on the nose, this has a ton of black fruit and char notes. This is mouth-filling, deep and powerful stuff, with a potent mash of baked blackberry, molasses and barbecue sauce filling in the flavor profile. It finishes long and roasted, with savory oak and saucy spice flavors. A blend of 85% Garnacha and 15% Monastrell.",Spain,Garnacha-Monastrell
"A light, elegant berry aroma transitions to notes of plum and blackberry with airing. Smooth and nice in terms of mouthfeel, it has balsamic-touched flavors of lightly stewed berry, earth and chocolate. This is a proper Rioja for near-term drinking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy raspberry aromas are easygoing and come with a hint of tobacco. It feels grabby but good, with lots of spice, pepper, herb and dark fruit flavors on the palate. The finish is healthy and well lifted, with a light but fresh herbal accent.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This needs air to show its best, because at first it's tight, mulchy and nutty. Early on, it feels clampy and scratchy, but it becomes better as it airs. The black fruit flavors are touched up by notes of oak, dried cheese and leather—characteristics that extend onto the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This reserva blend of Tempranillo, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon offers aromas of lead pencil and mossy berry. The lively palate deals coconut, spice, lemon peel and wild berry flavors. This is a powerful wine that will benefit from airing.",Spain,Red Blend
"Woodsy and smooth smelling, with integrated spice and black-fruit aromas. It feels like a padded vise grip, with demanding tannins and blackberry, toast and coffee flavors that narrow down due to tannic astringency. Incredibly flavorful and potent; drink or hold.",Spain,Red Blend
"Smells roasted and stemmy, with a burnt leaf and turned earth quality to the bouquet. Herbal, scratchy berry and plum flavors feel rough and don't exhibit enough freshness. Simply put: it's a leafy, muddled Ribera wine.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Mealy and heavy smelling, but with decent background fruit aromas and sweetness. Frankly, this already seems to be past its prime, evidenced by creamy, flat flavors of bland fruit and caramel. The finish needs snap and crispness but doesn't have any; a bit too sweet, candied and bitter already.",Spain,Rosé
"Heavy and nutty, almost like movie popcorn. In due time the nose transitions to creamy berry and cranberry. The palate is soft and muddled, with some citrus and red apple. Sweet and tomatoey on the finish; needs more focus, acidity and dryness.",Spain,Rosé
"A bit sharp, stemmy and sour smelling. But the fruit flavors are solid and the herbal cherry and plum character that leads the palate improves with airing. Herbal on the finish; standard as a whole.",Spain,Monastrell-Syrah
"This warm-climate Viura hits with plodding barrel aromas and flavors but there's not a lot of high-quality natural material to support that much faux/forced oak. Along the way it hints at mealy apple, spice, cinnamon powder and resin. A lot of noise but not much music.",Spain,Viura
"Meaty leathery blackberry aromas are less dressed up and polished than in past vintages. This Mencía feels jammy, wide and chunky, while flavors of spicy blackberry are limited. A toasty oaky lightly charred finish closes out this full-bodied offering from a tough cool year.",Spain,Mencía
"A recommended entry-level Ribera, with aromas of violets, minerals and oak. The palate has a standard, competent feel and balance along with flavors of gangly berry fruit and black cherry. Mocha and vanilla help sweeten and soften up the finish, but overall it's a regular, fresh type of wine.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Aromas of black fruits, light oak and violets are good but basic, and that pretty much defines the rest of the wine. Expect an easy flowing palate with candied, regular berry flavors in front of a light to medium finish. Nicely done and approachable.",Spain,Monastrell
"A jammy, fruity, extracted Tempranillo with simple, candied berry aromas followed by a heavy, bulky palate that's packed with warm berry fruit. A rich, young, jumpy sweetie that's designed to make you happy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice and prickly, with aromas of nettles, citrus and minerals. The palate is fresh and acidic, while the flavors of green apple, scallion, pineapple, lemon and grapefruit come together well. Clean and not overly acidic on the finish. Varietally speaking, this is on the money.",Spain,Verdejo
"A full-bodied red blend from Montsant. The nose is big and smells of black cherry, licorice and herbal, foresty notes, while the palate is saturated and grabby at the edges, with herb-tinged, roasted-berry flavors. Snappy and cheek-starching on the finish; drink now through 2011.",Spain,Red Blend
"Compared to the excellent 2006, this wine is heavier, riper and jammier at every check point. The nose is baked and raisiny, while the palate feels saturated to the extreme and gritty as well. The primary flavors run toward baked plum and blackberry, while licorice, leather and raisin notes carry the finish. Give this lots of air after opening, about an hour or so.",Spain,Red Blend
"Attractive and fruity on the front end, this has pure berry aromas but not a lot of nuance or complexity. It narrows a bit on the palate, with tight tannins that support the black fruit and coffee flavors. Juicy, bright and solid on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy, savory berry aromas are rubbery, while this feels fleshy and jammy. Young woody flavors outweigh the wine's basic fruit notes, while this tastes toasty on the finish.",Spain,Mencía
"Heavy aromas of orange marmalade and honey come across as unconvincing. The palate follows suit with bland, soft, chubby cantaloupe and green melon flavors. Finishes soft and dilute; seems like it's already dying in the bottle.",Spain,Verdejo
"Rough and leathery, with roasted black fruit and burnt-leaf aromas. The palate has a clacky, sharp feel and flavors of dried, baked berry fruits and leaves. Hard, roasted and leathery red wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lean raspberry and cherry aromas are the best part because the palate is rather raw and acidic, which causes raspiness and a tough mouthfeel. Flavors are sharp and red fruited, and there's an oak and vanilla element that's not that well integrated.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Expensive for what you get. The nose is a weird mix of salami and sweetness, and the palate is a syrupy, globular blend of cloying oak, caramel syrup and candied banana. Way too much wood and vanilla here, and not nearly enough balance or purity.",Spain,White Blend
"Smells lightly burnt and acrid, with stemmy berry aromas, apricot and match stick. The palate has a flat, creamy feel and stemmy, dry flavors of generic berry and bitterness. Too flat and devoid of fruit to rate higher.",Spain,Rosé
"Sharp, rubbery, stemmy aromas lead to an edgy palate with herbal, burnt, semigreen berry flavors. Finishes green and a bit weedy; acceptable but nothing to get excited over.",Spain,Monastrell
"Impressive for a 2008 Tempranillo. This opens with aromas of balsam wood, spice, blackberry and plum. The feel is grippy and intense, with notes of roasted berry, black olive, leather and a mildly-salty flavor. It finishes meaty, lightly herbal and slightly salinic, with a firm feel. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Gets rolling with a blitz of dark berry, cedar, bramble and graphite aromas. It feels punchy for being a dark-style red, with meaty black-fruit flavors. On the palate, it turns juicier and more rugged as the acidity steps up, ultimately finishing thick but catchy, with peppery spice. A blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet and Merlot.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is floral and minerally on the nose, with notes of tobacco and bold berry. Feels structured and solid, with dark berry, carob and sweet mocha flavors. It's lean, mild and smooth on the finish both in terms of flavor and feel. A winner among Alicante wines.",Spain,Monastrell
"Smoky and earthy smelling, with aromas of tobacco, subtle spice and dried cherry. This feels tight, with more acidity than body at this point in its evolution. Flavors of dried raspberry, plum, earth and brown sugar are solid and classic. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rusty and mature in color, with earthy, lightly leafy aromas that come with notes of maple and brown sugar. This feels elegant and fit, with classic Rioja flavors of dried red fruit, cocoa and malt. The finish is long and tasting lightly baked. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Sweet and toasty, with overt oak, sarsparilla, raisin and coconut aromas. It feels supersaturated, with monster tannins. Flavors of black coffee, chocolate, spice, pepper and licorice are rich and deep, while the finish is chewy, meaty and long. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Citrus and apple aromas are fresh, reserved and on the light side. In the mouth, this pops with lemony acidity and related tang. Flavors of tart green apple and lime are racy almost to the point of being sour, while this ends with a tingle of sharp acidity and a sense of wet stones and minerals.",Spain,Albariño
"Earthy, savory berry aromas are rubbery, while this feels fleshy and jammy. Young woody flavors outweigh the wine's basic fruit notes, while this tastes toasty on the finish.",Spain,Mencía
"Aromas of wet cement, plum, blueberry and cherry come with moderate oak. This feels wide and grabby, with no definitive focal point. Spicy earthy slightly exotic berry and plum flavors finish with grabby tannins and juicy acidity.",Spain,Carignan-Grenache
"Fresh as can be, with pure aromas of nectarine and cherry blossoms. The palate is light but refreshing and lithe, with semisweet, punchy flavors of orange, peach and pith. Finishes clean and light in the classic, subtle, utilitarian way that a good Rioja rosé should.",Spain,Rosé
"Warm, lightly baked aromas of berries and earth give this a common, likable bouquet, which is backed by a proper feeling palate and flavors of plum, mulberry, earth and herbs. Settles well on the finish, with good length and more than adequate purity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Fairly dense and slightly herbal on the nose, with balsamic notes, dried cheese and mature fruit aromas. This is still spunky and well composed in the mouth, with flavors of tobacco, earthy berry and toasty oak. Shows weight and grab on the finish. An honest, mature wine to drink now; it's not going to improve.",Spain,Garnacha-Cabernet
"Nice on the nose, with berry aromas, ample richness and rubber. The powerful palate delivers big-time blackberry, toast, roasted plum, coffee and chocolate, while the finish is also chocolaty and stout in structure. Chunky but tasty. A good Jumilla wine consisting of 85% Monastrell and 15% Syrah.",Spain,Monastrell
"A chunky, thick, earthy type of wine with syrupy, sweet berry flavors and a friendly palate that's tannic but not too much so. Caramel and carob mix with coffee and cola on the finish, and overall it is good RDD if you don't mind full extraction and syrupy richness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A Priorat blend made in a softer, more simple style. The nose has plum, prune, licorice and rooty scents, which precedes a thick, sweet palate that has mild tannic grip and flavors of raisin, black plum and wild berry. Plump and broad, with good depth.",Spain,Red Blend
"Good for a mature wine but it does smell a bit flat and damp. That murkiness blows off somewhat, leaving a solid, aged Rioja wine with acidic zap and lightly baked berry, cherry, tomato and spice flavors. Mild on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy smelling, with slightly murky baked berry aromas. The palate is juicy and snappy, with strawberry and raspberry flavors that carry a bit of richness. Becomes sweeter as it opens, with vanilla and fresh tomato and herb accents. Reliable as always.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark in color and dense on the nose, this has aromas of pastry, blackberry, jammy plum and even an exotic note. It feels chewy and solid, with a full-bodied texture and deep flavors of black cherry and prune. It comes up a bit short and clipped on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is generous and ripe, with spicy black-fruit aromas. It feels full but shows elegance with its depth and layering. Flavors of blackberry, plum, tobacco and oak stick out on the palate. It's long, sturdy, leathery and somewhat complex on the finish. Drink now through 2016.",Spain,Red Blend
"With aromas of warm earth, cedar, tobacco and meaty black fruit, this covers the basics of Ribera. It feels plump, round and maybe a bit flat, with rich, ripe blackberry, prune and spice flavors. It's harmonious and full-bodied on the finish.",Spain,Tinta Fina
"All indigenous grapes are welcomed by our tasting panel, but sometimes they are unknown and little used for a reason. This wine, made from the local Maturana Tinta, is a green, mean, lean wine with herbal aromas and flavors that, let's face it, are vegetal. Tastes tart and short, with a strong, driving green character throughout.",Spain,Maturana
"Dusty, sweet and gummy on the nose, and not very vital. The palate is chunky and dull, with mealy white fruit flavors and a bit of fino sherry or manzanilla. Made from the Malvar grape, and the result is strange and lazy.",Spain,Malvar
"Raisiny and thin smelling at the same time. The palate is dilute, citric and sheering, with tangy red currant and citrus flavors. Acidity keeps it vital but there's little flavor, body and structure. Ends up thin and sour.",Spain,Red Blend
"Smells like mealy fruit and bananas, while the palate is weak in constitution and a bit spritzy in feel. Tastes like bland white fruits with vanilla. Cloying on the finish.",Spain,Malvasia
"There's a reason Airén is used as a base grape for brandy and Sherry wines, and it's because it's not up to table-wine quality, even at the value price point. This wine is corny and lacks freshness. It's dull, wayward and offers little to no structure. Barely drinkable.",Spain,Airen
Smells like fruit juice. Overall it's raisiny and pruney. Drinkable but barely. Doesn't bring clarity or proper balance.,Spain,Tempranillo
"A sweet, raisiny old-vines Garnacha with candied aromas and a fat, chunky body that houses soft, short black fruit and peppery flavors. Tastes like licorice candy on the finish, which brings some heat and burn as well. An interesting Grenache that is sweet but isn't over the top in terms of ripeness.",Spain,Grenache
"Rusty in color, with initial aromas of smoke, dried leaves, herbs, tobacco and subtle berry. That all indicates that it's not overdone, and thus the tobacco, earth and dried fruit flavors are par for the course. Dry and leafy on the finish, which indicates that now is the time to get at it.",Spain,Garnacha
"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather. The palate has a nice, ripe, bodied feel, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry bring just the slightest hint of herbal green. Toasty and solid on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas. The palate has good snap and verve to it, while the feel is on the lean side. Flavors of baked berry, earth, caramel and coffee ring true, and the dry, toffee-tinged finish is a nice ending. Ready to go now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The apple and lime aromas are simple yet inviting. It feels round and mellow, maybe a bit low in acidity. The flavors of banana, vanilla bean and pear are friendly, while the finish is smooth and bears a tropical flavor.",Spain,Verdejo
"Berry candy and licorice aromas become more subtle and earthy with air. It feels grabby and abrasive as many Toro's are prone to be, with blackberry and root notes and a sugar beet flavor. The slightly hot, candied finish holds onto that rooty character.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A little richer and slightly more oaked than Beronia's basic '06 Rioja, this crianza has a nice red-fruit character, body weight and plump, friendly flavors of raspberry and red plum. With smooth tannins and vanilla on the finish, it comes across as a classic-style everyday Rioja. Drink now through 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opening pastry aromas are a bit heavy, but the palate is solid and balanced, and the flavors of gooseberry, green herbs and apple work. This Cava has a mild green character to it once it hits the mouth, but it finishes dry, crisp and focused. 450 cases made.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A ripe and rich style, with black cherry, raisin and a hint of candy on the nose. The palate shows some bulk and a bit of raisin, but also bold raspberry and plum. Solid on the finish, where you get a true reflection of the palate and its core fruit flavors. Tannic; drink now and throughout 2010–11.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Bullish, oaky and ripe, with leathery black-fruit aromas touched up with plenty of smoke, coconut and toast. This feels full, juicy and aggressive, with a quick rush of black fruit flavors and even more oak tones of coconut and bitter chocolate. It finishes like espresso and burnt toast. Drink now through 2016.",Spain,Mencía
"Coffee, vanilla and dried-cheese aromas turn charred and toasty with airing. On the palate, it's generous but a little rough, with lemony oak, clove, black fruit and resiny flavors. Oak, clacky tannins and herbal shadings control the finish. Drink from 2013–2017.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is sweet, easy, powdery and entirely inviting on the nose. It feels pure and correct on the palate, with apple, white grape, kiwi and lime flavors. The finish is long, sweet and totally comfortable. Only 2,500 were cases made.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Opens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors. Warm, simple touches of licorice and mint define the finish. A blend of 60% Monastrell with 20% each Syrah and Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fresh berry aromas carry some spice notes, while the palate is rugged and a little hot. Juicy berry flavors are forward but not overly evolved or complex, and the the finish is tight and aggressive. Spunky and clean, with honest flavors.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A solid but seemingly standard blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha with berry and cherry aromas along with touches of mint and leather. The palate is woody, with spiced berry flavors and decent body and structure. Vanilla and then oak-based bitterness define the finish. A good wine but hardly a knockout.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Tight and largely neutral white fruit aromas show a little apple but little more. The palate is friendly and easy, with melon as the lead flavor. Turns more citrusy and weighty on the finish, which fades fast.",Spain,White Blend
"One of the best $7 wines you'll find from Spain. The nose is bright, medicinal and floral, while the palate is loud and peppy, with sweet red fruit flavors that sport a candied coating. Fresh, tasty and simple, which is what it should be. 60% Bobal and 40% Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Solabal captures the essence of Rioja reserva with this fairly oaked, fruity wine. The palate is tight and demanding, with proper acid-to-tannin balance. Flavors of wild raspberry and plum are lively, while the finish shows some creaminess, tobacco and warmth. Drink now and over the next two years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A leader in user-friendly Monastrell from Jumilla is Luzón. Altos is the winery's high-expression baby, and if you like a bruiser with char, toast, coffee and other nocturnal characteristics, then look no further. Dynamite in terms of ripeness, with monster black-fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors. Not for the weak.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark, ripe and handsome. Those are the basics on this showy wine. Aromas of leather, shoe polish and char darken up the berry fruit, while flavors of blackberry and plum vie with oak-based mocha. Plenty of length and potential on the finish, but also some hard oak that needs more time to get absorbed. Best in 2009–2010.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Light in color with aromas of finely scented bath soap, strawberry, fresh cream and steel. The palate is a touch sweeter than you might expect, and that's because this is 60% Monastrell (Mourvèdre) along with Garnacha and Pinot Noir. Still, it's an elegant wine with punch bowl flavors.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Raisin and heavy plum aromas suggest full ripeness and even some overripeness. It feels chewy and textured, with serious concentration and baked flavors of dark berry and roasted plum. This tips the scale in terms of weight and ripeness, delivering a deep, roasted character that calls for near-term consumption",Spain,Garnacha
"Full, ripe and lusty, this has notes of licorice and grit on the bouquet. It feels fresh and lively, with enough richness and weight for balance. It tastes of balsamic-infused berry and spice, with an integrated herb note peeking through.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Stolid and compact on the nose, with generic berry aromas. The plate has a tannic stickiness to it, while the flavors veer toward jammy blackberry. More ripe and young in style as opposed to lean and aged. Molasses on the finish yields a sweet ending.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Rich, saturated and dark, with initial aromas of game and salsa and then more typical raspberry and plum. This is a big, ripe-style wine with strong tannic grip, ample oak and jammy berry fruit flavors. It isn't overly complex or elevated in character, but it's rock solid and immensely ripe.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is packed with oaky, masculine aromas of black fruit, bacon, moss and leather, but in the mouth it's rough as nails, with heavy tannins propping up flavors of blackberry, baked plum, herb and smoke. It finishes earthy and toasty, with thick tannins and ruggedness. Drink now with beef.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is nicely done given that 2008 was a subpar year throughout Spain. The bouquet deals full berry and cherry aromas with notes of exotic spices and perfume. It feels thick and creamy but polished, with deep blackberry and cassis flavors. Jammy almost to the point of raisiny, but with such deep fruit it works.",Spain,Red Blend
"Among bone-dry Cavas, this is one of the best in Spain. It's focused pastry and pear aromas lead directly onto the tangy, citric palate. The flavors of orange, grapefruit and mineral are developed and crisp, remaining firm on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"One of the best efforts we've tried from Jumilla, Luzon's luxury blend starts with coconut, mint, char and fudge, and below that is a treasure trove of deep black fruit. Huge blackberry and black cherry flavors are potent as they ride on a wave of jolting tannins. An affordable shining star for a rising region.",Spain,Red Blend
"This younger-vines mix of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah is very attractive and loaded with graphite, schisty mineral and black cherry aromas. The palate comes in waves, with the first delivering plum and berry and the second offering chocolate, herbs and lavender. Quite pretty and very tannic. Hold until 2008, if possible.",Spain,Red Blend
"Intense and deep, with plenty of licorice, leather and pepper encasing serious dark-berry aromas. The wine runs round and full in the mouth, with chewy berry flavors, meaty tannins and a generous finish that's long and just a touch lemony from the wine's 20 months in barrel. A wine that speaks to you.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Full, roasted and earthy on the nose, with only some coconut and berry aromas to sweeten things up. Tight, level and structured in the mouth, with roasted raspberry and plum along with oaky, buttery, smoky accents that confirm the wine's “roble” designation. Good but with some excess oak to process.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Floral, spicy, semi-oaky aromas precede a tangy, fresh, higher-acid palate with snappy raspberry and red cherry flavors. There's an abundance of pop and snap to this medium-bodied wine, and then drying woody notes to the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of balsam wood, dry leather, and slightly herbal berry fruit are generally appealing, while the palate has size, balance and a healthy feel to it. More woody and spicy than outright fruity, with a touch of zesty raspberry and strawberry at the core. Nice but simple red wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous. The palate is well balanced and the flavors run sweet, ripe and chewy, with berry fruit and creamy licorice notes on the finish. A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Garnacha from Catalonia.",Spain,Syrah-Grenache
"Aromas of cactus pad, green apple and jalapeño are true Verdejo, while the palate brings citrusy, melony fruit as well as chalky, minerally dryness. Tastes a bit like white grape skins, with tangerine and lemon on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Opens with a blast of cola and minty grass, and then comes a raisiny wave and mossy herbal notes that are typical of Navarran Merlot, which makes up 60% of this three-grape blend. Gritty in the mouth, with black cherry, licorice, herbs, raisin and lasting sweetness on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Red berry and plum aromas form the base of this wine's fresh, uncomplicated bouquet. It feels juicy and bright, with good layering and aggressive flavors of berry and plum. The finish is dry and snappy, with mild oak and spice flavors.",Spain,Garnacha
"Jammy strawberry, crushed raspberry and mineral aromas define the bouquet. The palate is lifted by good acidity, while flavors of vanilla and tomato accent the raspberry and plum fruits. Fresh and subtle on the finish, this is a middleweight wine with a juicy disposition.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Chunky and chocolaty on the nose, with aromas of raisins, blackberries and other black fruits. It feels easy and round, with balance and toasty flavors of blackberries and dark cherries. This finishes with a blend of coffee, rubber, mocha and vanilla flavors. An excellent wine; drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Baked and rubbery up front, with asphalt, roasted peanut and black fruit aromas. In the mouth, it's solid and stately, with black plum and raspberry flavors, good balance and a taught, muscular structure. It tastes bright and mildly complex. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Red Blend
"You want color and heft? You get that here, and more. Dark, grapy aromas are lush more than rough and tight, while the palate is full of sassy black cherry fruit and a fair share of richness. No doubt this jam-packed blend of Garnacha, Merlot and Carignan is solid and rewarding. 250 cases produced.",Spain,Red Blend
"From a brutally hot vintage, this shows plenty of mineral, schist and cola aromas along with impeccably smooth fruit. It's a little racy and sheer in the mouth, but food will balance that without a problem. And along the way you should enjoy the licorice, cherry, kirsch and other crafty nuances that this fine blend of Cabernet, Garnacha and Carignan has to offer. Drink now through 2009.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mildly sweet and candied, with accents of rose petal, red licorice and high-quality raisin. As always, it's an intense wine with red raspberry, cherry and plum flavors in front of finishing vanilla and butter. It's a bit grabby and tannic, but it seems to have harnessed correct ripeness in what was a difficult, hot year.",Spain,Red Blend
"Waxy melon and apple aromas are intricate and welcoming, while the melon and citrus flavors are just as they should be. Do Ferreiro is a consistent high-end producer in Rias Baixas and its '05 Albariño is great. It picks up steam as it goes along and will go great with salads and seafood. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Here's a really good, young Mencia that is sure to win you over. The nose is fully ripe and loaded with pure berry aromas. The juicy mouth is warm and meaty, with pure fruit and chewy tannins. Luna Beberide's Mencia pinpoints the essence of modern Bierzo.",Spain,Mencía
"After a couple of rough years, all Fluminus needed was the good 2004 vintage. And the result is splendid. This blend of Cab, Garnacha and Carignan is pure as can be, with polished leather and fine tobacco aromas entering the fray. The whole is complete and big-boned, but in the end it's more tight and compact than plush. Give it two years to show its best side.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rustic fruit aromas led by the native Samso grape cause a stir, and the wine, which also has Garnacha, Cabernet and Merlot, carries forth in the mouth, where lush blackberry and plum flavors are supported by healthy, spicy, minty oak. With tight tannins and comfortable acidity, it will drink better in a few years. Imported by Bernard Magrez.",Spain,Red Blend
"Concentrated, willing aromas of black cherry and sweet plum are nice and friendly, while the palate is lively, juicy and a little tart for Garnacha, with an emphasis on red raspberry. The wine dries out a bit on the finish, leaving vanilla and spice. Good enough for a basic Aragonese red.",Spain,Garnacha
"A pretty good Tempranillo-Garnacha blend with simple but fresh berry and plum aromas. The palate has snap but no overt acidic bite, while flavors of cherry and berry are slightly herbal and end with a mild buttery accent. A touch flimsy but keeps it together.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Standard black-cherry aromas carry a candied, vanilla-like twinge, while the feel is juicy and snappy. Flavors of sweet berries and cherry are just fine, and they come with a nod of spice and bitterness. Punchy and fresh overall, with good ripeness and balance.",Spain,Garnacha
"Roasted and leathery smelling, with aromas of brick dust, root beer and exotic spices. Feels grabby and astringent, with boistrous tannins. It tastes toasty and black, with baked berry flavors and tons of chocolate and spice. It feels a bit choppy on the finish, with an espresso-like aftertaste.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This opens with a classic Rioja nose of leather, dried cheese, roast berry and spice. It feels chunky and quite solid, with roasted fruit, tomato and herbal flavors on a deep palate. This is long and a touch warm on the finish, but healthy and ready to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The bouquet is dosed with resiny oak and vanilla aromas, but there are herbal notes, leather and red fruit scents as well. It feels good but slightly sticky, with flavors of vanilla, coconut, tomato, red plum and herb. This feels good on the finish, with tobacco, vanilla and oak flavors. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hailing from the very hot 2003 vintage, this wine is baked and full, with mature yet rich aromas. It feels thorough and weighty, with sweet berry flavors that are at their peak along with a chocolate note. This is warm, full and under control on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The aromas of wet clay, mild chili peppers, cedar and sweet berry mesh nicely. On the palate it is plump and a touch greasy, with richness in spades along with plum and berry flavors. It feels weighty on the finish, with a licorice note. A very good wine from the little-know Vidadillo grape.",Spain,Vidadillo
"Sweet, succulent aromas draw you in and while the wine doesn't deliver much nuance on either the nose or palate, we can't quibble with the power, purity and intensity of the blackberry fruit. It's young, tannic and tough now, so give it two years and it should be an excellent wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A modern-style offering from the up-and-coming region of Yecla, near Alicante. The grape used is Monastrell, a k a Mourvèdre. It's bold and packed with blackberry, pepper and other spices. It's the perfect wine to enjoy with barbecue, stews and roasts. This wine busted onto the scene just a couple of years ago, earning accolades for its full flavors and overall character. For the price, it's a big-time bargain.",Spain,Monastrell
"Punchy berry aromas are floral and jumpy, and the palate is more sheering and tart than expected, but still fresh and clean. Zesty black cherry flavors are softened by buttery oak, and the finish is racy. Could use more flavor and depth along with less acidic bite.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"A better wine than the label's varietal Garnacha, so it seems as though the Tempranillo brings character and elevation. Wild berry and cherry aromas mix in citrus and spice, while the palate is fruity, with pepper and soft spice flavors. Turns a touch tart and toward cranberry the longer it's open.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"A little bit dark and crusty on the bouquet, with murky, earthy black cherry aromas that get clearer and cleaner with air. Briary plum and cherry flavors are solid if nothing else, and the finish is basically more of the same, with length. A competent wine, but that's where it ends.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty, lightly oaked berry aromas are entirely regular, while the berry driven palate is dry, drawing and oaky, with pretty good body but stand-out acidity as well. Tastes a bit woody and peppery late. A highly generic wine that makes you wonder why it costs $30.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"This is light, mildly yeasty, slightly pickled and briny smelling. It feels fresh and edgy, with good acidic cut, while the flavors lean toward orange and white peach. It holds onto its briny character on the finish, which is dry, bracing and tastes of mineral and lime.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Harmonious on the bouquet, this has aromas of berry, marzipan and nutmeg. It feels a little acidic but that adds freshness to the package. The flavors of earthy, roasted fruits are a touch salty, and the finish tastes briney and baked, with notes of coffee and toast. A blend of 65% Tempranillo, 20% Merlot and 15% Caberent Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Black in color and dense on the nose, this has well-oaked aromas of black fruit, lemon peel and cedar. It feels full and fresh, with good acidity and prickly tannins. It tastes juicy and clean, with berry, black plum, vanilla, tobacco and spice flavors that carry through onto the finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"A heavy rush of black coffee is the key aroma, and with that comes notes of rustic barrel char and black fruit. It delivers a solid structure and a firm foundation, along with sticky tannins and oak-based resin. It tastes dark, with baked plum, tobacco and spice. This is creamy, charred and oaky from start to finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet on the nose but also a little green, with minty aromas of herb mixed with blueberry. It feels typically tannic and tough, with roasted blackberry and chocolate flavors. The finish is tannic, with spicy, chocolaty flavors that last for quite a while. Drink now. USA Wine West.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Dense and somewhat roasted on the bouquet, with tarry, leathery aromas. This feels good but angular, with sheering acidity, firm tannins and solid flavors of red berry, plum, herb and pepper. It's lengthy but a little hot and grabby on the finish. A blend of 50% Cabernet and 50% Merlot.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Pine and juniper aromas mix with berry and plum scents on a lively but dense and slightly volatile nose. Airing leads to an edgy, full-bodied palate with baked berry, plum and tomato flavors. This is long, lively and mildly herbal on the finish. A bit wiry and high in acid.",Spain,Monastrell
"This opens with gritty aromas of mineral, char, mushroom, leather and berry fruits. It feels cutting and juicy, but it has the body to handle it. The flavors of berry and cherry are bright and tight, while chocolate and earthy notes reside in the background. Toasty, dark and tough on the finish, drink this Syrah-Cariginan blend now through 2014.",Spain,Red Blend
"Sweet and welcoming; a good deal among pedigreed red wines. The nose on this 100% Monastrell from older vines is mammoth, toasty and dark, while the palate is chunky and virtually melts with blackberry, plum and cherry flavors. A real-deal red with breadth and class. 1,000 cases made.",Spain,Monastrell
"This muscular youth proves that Priorat can deliver fleshy, modern wines. Or maybe it's the 20% Merlot that's softenening the Garnacha and Carignan. Either way, look for lush plum and black cherry flavors floating on a rich, heady palate. This is more Escalade or Range Rover than sports car.",Spain,Red Blend
"Very nice apple blossom and lightly stony aromas greet you, and the apple and apricot flavors are juicy and ripe. This is an all-fruit wine with just enough acidity and minerality to keep it in shape. Finishes with citrus and melon. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Super dense and hard as a rock, with bacon and black fruit aromas that lead straight to a saturated, chewy, tannic palate that pounds away as it delivers blackberry, coffee, licorice and other huge flavors. As big, baked and heavy as they come, with gargantuan tannins. Includes 15% Syrah in addition to Monastrell.",Spain,Monastrell
"Smells sort of gummy and candied, with aromas of red licorice stick, raisin and raspberry jam. The palate is sizable but comes with racy acidity, thus the flavors veer toward red fruits with an herbal accent. Burns a little on the finish due to sharp acids.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lightly stemmy and brambly, with lean red fruit aromas, a touch of saline and red licorice candy. The palate is lean and sort of scratchy, while the flavors are suggestive of red apple skins and red plum. Tight on the finish; similar is some ways to a simple Chianti.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef. It's super-chunky on the tongue, with dominating roasted black fruit flavors. It has its merits but is still too blackened for our liking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Gritty on the nose, this has baked bean, mushroom, roasted plum and earth aromas. It feels blocky and tannic, with some cushion to the palate. Oaky tasting, with prune, vanilla and buttery notes that settle on baked fruit and chocolate. It comes on forceful and heavy and is arguably a little overripe.",Spain,Tempranillo
"From a good vintage like 2009, this modest Tinta de Toro has a lot to offer. It smells slightly rustic but full of fruit. The palate has a tannic but balanced feel, with dark, sweet flavors of cassis and blackberry. It's peppery and lightly herbal on the finish.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Big and yellow, which is evidence of the oak aging on this plump, modern Verdejo that's made in small quantity and will appeal to those who like things such as Sémillon and Chenin Blanc. The body is full, there's fruit, weight and grip, and the ripeness versus minerality is just right. Drink now with cheese or fish. 300 cases produced.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dry, smoky and lightly fruity, this Pinot Noir-based Cava is about as good as it gets in the price range. The nose delivers distant brown sugar and burnt leaves, while the palate lays on the orange rind, peach and cherry skin flavors. Try this classy sparkler; you won't be disappointed.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Inviting aromas of tobacco, earth, cedar and bacon give weight to racy berry scents. It's stripped and tight as a drum on the palate, with fiery acidity creating tangy raspberry and plum flavors accented by notes of tobacco, wood spice and citrus. This is best enjoyed with food; on its own it's a bit sharp.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy, meaty berry aromas are solid and sturdy. It feels fresh and lifted by lasting acidity, with flavors of raspberry, strawberry and vanilla that are easy to like. A wine to drink now without too much contemplation, this finishes steady and smooth.",Spain,Red Blend
"A bit scratchy, leathery and herbal on the bouquet, but there's also a stony character and raspberry aromas. It feels crisp and a bit sheering, with flavors of zesty red fruit, citrus and vanilla filling in the gaps. The finish is long and lightly oaky.",Spain,Monastrell
"This opens with sweet, compact aromas of raisin and spice. It feels more perky and crisp in the mouth, with a slight acidic cut and flavors of roasted berry, herb and chocolate. The finish is lightly herbal and minty, with peppery spice and plenty of length. A classic Bordeaux blend of roughly one-third each of Cabernet, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.",Spain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Spicy and savory smelling, with interesting aromas that encompass maple, chili powder, smoked meat and mildly baked berries. The palate is round and a little rough in the tannic category. But overall this wine is exceedingly pleasant, well made and pretty much ready to drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"If you don't mind some heavy barrel char, then you'll probably like this rough rider. It has espresso and asphalt on the nose, and then you get leathery plum and berry fruit on the palate. A good wine, with a long finish, lots of oak and overall balance. In a nutshell, there's plenty going on.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not often do you come across an aged Valdepeñas red, especially one with style, structure and character. The nose of dried fruits and spices also features cigar box and tomato, while the palate of red plum, cherry and tomato is mature. With some length and intensity to the finish, this is perfect to drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Scala Dei seems to have managed 2003's tough conditions, and this is endowed with sweet Garnacha-driven aromas that touch up against raisiny but don't cross the line. The palate is plump and loaded with strawberry and vanilla flavors, then chocolate shows up on the finish. The blend is 41% Garnacha, 41% Syrah and 18% Cab Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Peach, melon and natural vanilla aromas are an open invitation to this fresh Spanish white. Feels jumpy and lively like it should, with green fruit, citrus, apple and melon flavors. Spunky on the finish, this is textbook Verdejo.",Spain,Verdejo
"With a nose of citrus and mineral and a fresh palate, this is nothing but pleasing. Flavors of grapefruit, tangerine, lime and green apple are direct and lively, while the finish is long and fruity. This is how Verdejo should be.",Spain,Verdejo
"Lightly spiced up front, with cinnamon and nutmeg aromas adding complex sweetness to cherry and cassis scents. It feels juicy and sincere, with a mix of berry, plum, herb, spice and licorice flavors. This turns toward vanilla on the finish. A traditional wine that's ready now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Plenty of intense new oak sets the nose in a direction toward mint, licorice and black pepper. And that's all good, because the palate backs it up  with prime blackberry and cassis flavors. This is a solid wine with slightly pronounced acids and tannins. Not for those averse to a little grab and kick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nicely balanced and a better example of the upside of Navarra than the wines that are based on or include Merlot. The nose shows some herbal character but more deep fruit notes. And in the mouth there's ripe cherry, cassis and plum. Texturally, it's very nice, and when you get down to the nuts and olts it's a very good value.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo
"Carchelo is at its best in this vintage. This is loaded with wild blackberry and leathery sass, too. Typical of Jumilla, it's big, saturated and packed with ripe berry flavors, jabbing tannins and warmth. A true hot-climate country wine but one with polish and pizzazz.",Spain,Monastrell
"Earthy and leathery smelling, this has briary, almost cheesy-berry and oak aromas. This feels full, and it evolves with airing. Flavors of herbal black fruit join notes of tobacco, peppery spice and mint that carry onto the finish. A blend of 60% Tempranillo and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the Cab standing out.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Gritty aromas of olive, herbs and charred berry give this Montsant wine a Chilean-like bouquet. The palate is wide, blunt and tannic, with blackberry and stewed plum flavors. It mellows out on the finish, with earth notes. It's solid and sturdy, but feels tough. A blend of Garnacha, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"This smells fruity, like a mix of melon, mango and sweet nectarine. It feels alert and alive, with fresh flavors of melon, passion fruit and green currant. On the finish, it settles down without forcing things. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"Roasted and rustic up front, with bricky, oaky berry aromas. This is tight and ripped across the palate, with hickory, maple and bacon flavors. It's zesty in terms of mouthfeel, with adequate chunkiness. The finishing flavors of spice, herb and earth are solid.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The leathery red-berry aromas are a tad stretched and tight but still good. This feels zesty, snappy and alert in the mouth, with lightly herbal flavors of red plum and tangy cherry tomato. The hickory spice imparted from 24 months of oak aging shows up on the finish along with licorice.",Spain,Red Blend
"Toasty, yeasty and quite composed given the price point. If you like green apples, ripe pears or lychee fruit, chances are you're going to like this well-blended and fairly smooth Cava. It's persistent and structured enough to go with appetizers or main courses.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Raspberry and a touch of citrus peel make for a light, appealing nose, while the red cherry and red apple skin flavors are cheerful, bouncy and attractive. For a basic Garnacha from Campo de Borja, this has it all: color, fresh fruit, balance and character.",Spain,Garnacha
"Rarely do you find musclebound, intense reds priced at $8 that are this good. But Luzon manages to give you a 65/35 blend of Monastrell and Syrah that is lively, loaded and eminently likable. It's all about hefty black fruit, bold tannins and flash. Only 5,000 cases made.",Spain,Red Blend
"Brutal heat didn't do a lot for Mas La Plana in 2003. While still a worthy wine, this one shows some green on the nose and palate, while the balance is weightier than normal. In its favor, there's bold blackberry and a touch of cola on the palate. Good but not up to the wine's usual high standards.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Blackberry, tobacco and balsamic aromas lean slightly towards vinegar, and there's a distinct tangy quality to the palate. Otherwise, the wine is very nice, with plum and blackberry flavors. Tobacco notes reappear on the finish along with toasty oak. Will do best with food.",Spain,Mencía
"Mature, earthy and soft on the nose, with roasted, spicy, integrated berry aromas. Full but baked feeling, with maturity and monotone flavors of sweet berries that don't vary. It remains roasted and warm on the finish. Drink soon.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"For a 60,000-case Toro, this is very good and well recommended. It smells full, leathery and slightly cheesy, with baked berry aromas. The palate is smooth, with minty, spicy, black fruit flavors. A hint of young oak rises up on the finish.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Smoky, dark and robust, with blackberry and black coffee on the bouquet. It's full, textured, resiny and tannic on the palate, with blocky blackberry, leather and a pinch of saltiness. Dry, dense and oaky late, this is powerful overall.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy berry aromas come with a dense coating of milk chocolate. But in the mouth, it's snappy and juicy, with enough body to handle the acids. It tastes fresh, pointed and zesty, with plum and berry flavors that finish full and grabby. A very good old-vine Garnacha for the price.",Spain,Garnacha
"Generally speaking, this is a respectable Priorat from a tough year. The nose is berry packed, while the flavors run toward toast-covered raspberry. It's typically grabby and expansive, as any good young wine from the area will be, yet you can drink it now with meat.",Spain,Red Blend
"Lightly herbal and slightly leafy smelling, with tobacco, earthy berry and chocolate aromas. This feels tight and well built, with zesty red-berry, plum, spice and herbal flavors. It finishes toasty, with sweet mocha accents.",Spain,Monastrell
"Damp earth, subtle berry, plum and smoke notes define the nose. It feels typically tannic and clampy for Ribera del Duero, with leathery, roasted flavors of blackberry, rubber and herbs. Long, meaty and dense on the back side, with chewy tannins and sweet lasting flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's not much difference between this wine and the label's less expensive Brandal. This is a bit richer, with chunky melon aromas and peach melba flavors. But it may suffer a bit from additional ripeness and lower acidity. For best results, get at it fast.",Spain,Albariño
"A little weighty, with ripe apple and peach aromas. Fairly succulent in the mouth, with apple and citrus flavors that are both sweet and a touch chewy. Some pith on the finish adds complexity and overall you can't knock the wine's character. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"In 2005 this winery got a great harvest, and it's evident in this ripe, clean Garnacha that hits with jammy aromas and a ton of fresh-fruit flavors. Juicy, smooth and earnest is how to describe this tasty bargain from a region that doesn't always shine this bright.",Spain,Garnacha
"Heat from the 2003 vintage aside, this is one sweet, forward, dark-colored Cava. The nose is all about cheeky, sweet fruit, while the palate offers more berry sweetness along with vanilla. Normally this bottling is more restrained and striated, but 2003 was a warm year. May be better with desserts than appetizers, given the ripeness.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Strawberry and herbal aromas find their way to a tight, structured palate that's home to medicinal fruit flavors, accented by toast and bitter chocolate. Dark and medium-long on the finish, with freshness, depth and good complexity. Drink now.",Spain,Garnacha
"Tight aromas of cherry and cassis come with orange peel and licorice scents. It feels edgy and acidic on the palate, but there's enough body and fruit to absorb the acids. Tastes like schisty licorice, black fruits and spice, with a choppy, tannic, medium-long finish. Drink this Syrah-Carignan blend now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Nothing wrong with this pleasant, friendly Cava. The nose boasts frosted breakfast cereal and lemon curd, while the palate is defined by spiced apple and baked citrus. It gets more honeyed and fat as it opens, although a good chilling will keep that in check.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Nice and fruity, with a touch of spice to the nose. The palate is plump and dark, with nothing besides all-natural fruit. A hearty and healthy wine that boasts freshness and purity but no oak.",Spain,Mencía
"Fairly bold and ripe up front, with dark berry aromas and an almond candy undercurrent. The palate is a bit more red-fruit based than the bouquet, and the flavors of raspberry and red plums are satisfying a touch tangy. Interesting, with drying tannins on the finish.",Spain,Mencía
"Classic in every sense, from the early aromas of dill butter to the dry, acid-driven palate to the light, crisp finish. In a world where so many wines are going ripe and heavy, this one holds steady to the traditional. So if you're looking for an old-school Spanish red to go with tortilla espanola or lamb chops, this will do the trick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light and floral on the nose, and medium in intensity and acidity. Flavors of apple, green melon and citrus are clean and crisp, and overall the wine is a model of freshness. Drink it sooner rather than later; it's a touch on the soft side.",Spain,Verdejo
"This is a bit dry and scratchy on the bouquet, with direct cherry and plum aromas. It feels snappy and a little on the acidic side, with oaky creaminess softening things up. It tastes of vanilla, butter, cherry and plum, with vanilla on the finish. This comes across both bright and woody.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is toasty and overflowing with wild berry and cassis aromas. The palate is tight and tannic, with salty berry fruit flavors that seem wild and untamed. Stays salty on the finish, with herbal notes sneaking in. It smells great, but it's rough in terms of feel.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromas of pointed red plum and mild earthy, leafy aromas precede a well-constructed palate, with dark plum and standard berry flavors. This is a mellow wine that's very good for the price.",Spain,Monastrell
"Aromas of watermelon and a dusting of natural vanilla mark the bouquet. On the palate, it's fleshy but still crisp and focused, with nectarine, red apple and strawberry flavors. The finish lasts, with some sweetness.",Spain,Rosé
"With its black plum, blackberry and other bold, juvenile aromas, this bargain-priced Spaniard shows flavors of chocolate, natural bitterness and good overall balance. A little big and brawny, but better than washed out and weak. A classic chorizo or hamburger wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Moderately dark and dense, but hardly brooding and deep. This is a nice, zesty version of Mencia that highlights the grape's cherry and raspberry character. It's flush and features good fruit-to-acid balance.",Spain,Mencía
"No doubt this wine possesses peppery, herbal qualities. But before it's dismissed as green we'd like to note that there's also a nice savory side to it. More herbal than vegetal, and with decent balance. With food this wine will do just fine; on its own it may seem a touch reedy and rough.",Spain,Red Blend
"Plump, melony and ripe on the nose, with creamy pear, melon and banana flavors. Normally this wine is more racy and acidic than this, but the '05 seems tropical relative to previous years. Still, it's a good wine that will go down nicely if properly chilled. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"The Eguren brothers of Sierra Cantabria and other projects always do a nice job with this Tempranillo from central Spain. It's a no-frills, bulky red with rich fruit and bacon aromas backed by bold boysenberry and blackberry flavors. There's no shortage of voltage in this tight, jabby, slightly clumsy red.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Attractive aromas of cigar box, forest floor, plum and berry get this Tempranillo off to a good start. It feels crisp and juicy, with proper acidity cutting into flavors of buttery oak, raspberry and plum. On the finish it remains buttery tasting and turns grabby but also tangy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Heavily barrel influenced on the bouquet, where sawdust and resin aromas render any fruit to the upper deck. Feels resiny and sappy, and never really moves off that feel. Tastes of oak, baked apple and banana, with resiny oak controlling the finish. Nice but not great.",Spain,Verdejo
"Red berry and mild matchstick aromas augment the resiny oak scents from being barrel fermentation. It's juicy, fresh and healthy in the mouth, with a mix of red fruit and stone fruit flavors and a finish that's mild, consistent and long.",Spain,Rosé
"Lime, apple and mineral aromas come with a note of eggy yeast. The mouthfeel is regular and a touch foamy, with semisweet flavors of kiwi, apple and gooseberry. Mild and feeling good on the finish, it's basic but well worth a go.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Spunky and clean as a whistle, with pointed cherry aromas leading to a zesty, juicy palate with red plum and red berry flavors. It remains dry and poised on the finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"This Cabernet-Tempranillo blend is even-keeled and solid from start to finish. The palate shows good raspberry and cherry fruit, and the mouthfeel holds its form until the very end, when a touch of tomato and oak enter the picture. A nice wine for the money.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"It's already too late for an '04 Albariño, but this one still has some life and kick in it. The nose has some peanut and lacquer, but overall apple aromas ride high. In the mouth, it shows the oily quality of an aging white along with peach, citrus and nut flavors.",Spain,Albariño
"This Cab-Merlot blend delivers nice tobacco, char and dark fruit aromas, which are backed by plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors. Like most Navarran reds, there's some lettuce and other green characteristics. But for the most part the wine's balance, charm and mouthfeel win you over.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Young and bouncy, with jammy aromas of raspberries and strawberries. Immediately you know this has Tempranillo at the core, and fans should appreciate the pleasant combination of meaty flavors, a round body, solid ripeness and a good price.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Leathery, earthy aromas don't seem entirely fresh, but they are solid and don't waiver. Full bodied, with coarse tannins and roasted red-berry, tomato and herb flavors. It's tight, chunky and long on the finish, with tannic grab, and more tomato and herb characteristics.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Oily and pinched on the nose, with cactus and nettle aromas. This feels like a cool stream on the palate, with green-fruit flavors including lime, kiwi and apple. A note of pithy grapefruit controls the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"An impressive wine for $8. This smells savory, like a mix of smoked meats, roasted berries and leather, and it feels juicy and racy, with a good texture and honest flavors of blackberry, savory meat and spice. The finishes is mild, with mild herbal notes and tobacco.",Spain,Garnacha
"Full and smoky, with bacon, blackberry and tire rubber on the nose. This is a bit grating in feel due to full tannins and acids, with wild berry flavors, bitter oak, black plum and darkness. Lengthy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Citrusy on the nose, with rooty, restrained, earthy accents. It feels full but a bit dull in the middle, with flavors of minty spice, pepper and mature red fruit. Dry and drawing on the finish, with a tomatoey flavor.",Spain,Monastrell
"Opens with aromas of tobacco and dried leaves as well as plum and cherry, and that's backed by raspberry, plum and cherry tomato flavors. For an older wine, it's showing life, acidity and some old-school style. What it doesn't have are any of those New World characteristics, i.e. black fruit, chocolate and weight.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"There is much to like about this wine, particularly the cola and roasted fruit flavors that control the palate. But in front and back of that likable intermezzo is a sharp, prickly bouquet and a mouthfeel that's slightly grabby, tannic and elastic. Good but you want it to be better. Drink now.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"This offers chewy plum and berry flavors along with a finishing wave of vanilla, chocolate and coconut. It's fruity and forward, if a bit rubbery on the finish.",Spain,Shiraz-Tempranillo
"With full black-cherry and bacon aromas, this affordable wine comes across well on the nose. Thick and full-bodied in the mouth, this has flavors of blackberry, creamy oak, chocolate and vanilla. It feels broad and just bright enough on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Concentrated aromas of earthy black fruits and cola come with a slight burn. The aggressive, full-force palate feels grating and gritty but tastes good and smoky, with cherry and berry fruit topped off with oak and mint. It's a bit high in acid, which creates a tangy sensation on the finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"Strawberry and other red-fruit aromas run the bouquet. The palate is tangy and crisp, with dry but clean red-fruit flavors. Mildly spiced on the finish, this has length and purity. A very good quaffer.",Spain,Rosé
"Roasted and smelling a touch bricky, this also has full aromas of berry and black plum. Feels grabby but honest, with baked black-fruit flavors, chocolate, mocha and coffee. Jammy and deep on the finish, with earthy, chocolaty notes. A blend of 60% Garnacha with 20% each of Syrah and Merlot.",Spain,Red Blend
"There's more than enough to like about this red-fruit driven middleweight. It's sure handed and fruity, with enough grip, balance and character that it doesn't sway from that base-level quality line.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The melon and pineapple aromas are pure and carry a waxy edge. It feels simple and well comported, with green apple, pear and vanilla flavors. This is tasty, smooth, lively and classy; drink right away.",Spain,Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc
"Pink in color, this has fresh, clean aromas of stone fruits. Feels medium to full, with red licorice, sweet baking-spice and raspberry flavors. Quick, round and solid on the finish, which lingers for quite some time. A fine summer sipper.",Spain,Rosé
"Concentrated and sweet, with aromas of raisin and cassis that lead onto an intense, syrupy palate, with salty berry, brown sugar and fudge flavors. This is deep as a country well, with a ton of flavor. But truth be told, it's tannic as can be, with a crushing mouthfeel that makes food mandatory.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Bring on the funk, at least at first. This new-to-America wine gets out of the gate with wild leather, stable and bramble aromas, and there's always an aggressive, untamed quality to it. But with air it settles, and eventually true Tempranillo flavors emerge. More challenging than it should be.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"The nose deals perfume, sawdust and even some fruit, while tobacco, cassis and blackberry flavors are adequate if not overly impressive. More interesting than some in its class, with a few flaws along with virtues.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Leafy and minty up front, with jumpy fruit that runs toward tomato and pepper. It's a rugged little wine with hot and spicy oak notes along with some dill and burnt coffee. Not offensive but not exactly regal.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Floral, with berry aromas, it's also quite charred and oaky, with mocha. It feels weighty despite displaying prickly acidity, and there's a resiny feel to the palate as well. The flavors of baking spice, chocolate and blackberry run aside barrel-driven flavors. This is a big, oaky Garnacha.",Spain,Garnacha
"Vanilla and dill aromas are front and center. The palate imparts plum skin and red-apple flavors, with lots of rough tannins holding the feel hostage. There just isn't a lot of meat on the bones, so it comes across like a mouth full of hardware. Imported by Luneau USA Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe, warm and spicy on the nose, with standard red berry aromas and flavors. The mix is Tempranillo, Cab and Syrah, which is unusual. Yet the wine tastes perfectly open and familiar, as if you've had it and enjoyed it before. Nothing special but it's good and fruity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"An older wine with more oak than jazzy fruit, so the aromas are heavy with the scent of cinnamon and the palate is more drying and spicy than it is rich and rewarding. Still, with the right food you may be able to appreciate the wine's smoke and vanilla qualities.",Spain,Mencía
"This barrel-fermented Verdejo is interesting, but it's also a bit low on acidity. It smells like pine and blowsy flowers. Creamy, soft and cuddly on the palate, this has flavors of baked apple, wood resin and banana. It finishes round and sweet. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"Stalky and grassy smelling, which is par for a Penedès white blend. There str also apple and lemon-lime notes on the nose. In the mouth, it's lively and spritzy in feel, with pineapple, lime and grassy flavors. Zesty, dry and minerally on the finish, this should pair well with seafood and paella.",Spain,White Blend
"Peppy, clean black-fruit aromas come with a touch of leather. It feels full and juicy, with a firm texture and bright, lightly toasted flavors of plum and berry. This is an uncomplicated wine, the perfect quaffer for the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The briary, red fruit aromas are slightly prickly slightly, becoming fuller and deeper with time in glass. This feels solid and fairly dense for the price, with berry, peppery spice and light herb flavors. Fruity and friendly on the finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"Navarran Merlot often leans toward the vegetal. There's bell pepper and tomato on the nose, but also balancing red plum, cherry and raspberry on the palate. It's a touch sheer, scratchy and green, but the effort is there and by no means is it a bad, herbaceous wine.",Spain,Merlot
"Raspberry and strawberry aromas offer a reasonably good opening, backed by sweet strawberry and vanilla flavors. A bit sticky and candied, but overall it's friendly and round enough to make the grade.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite heavy; in fact, a touch too much. The nose is defined by corn and apple cider, while the palate is heavy and melony, with a lot of unbounded sweetness and softness. Needs more overt acidity and citrus to achieve proper balance.",Spain,Verdejo
"Interesting in that this fresh, snappy table wine includes 60% Airen (a white grape) in addition to Tempranillo. This odd combo results in a light-bodied, almost translucent wine that's easy to drink but offers little in the way of heft or complexity.",Spain,Red Blend
"This opens softly, with murky aromas of tomato and prune. It feels heavy and dense, with big tannins and mild acidity. The flavors of prune, mocha, fudge and stewed berry are rich and weighty. This is dense and ripe, a touch flat.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is stewy smelling, with tomato leaf and raisiny notes. It feels dense and mature, with mild acidity creating jammy raspberry and plum flavors along with a lot of barrel spice. The oak flavor is dominant on the finish.",Spain,Merlot
"Rather dilute and basic, with a touch of buttercup to the sweet, mellow nose. In the mouth there's almond skin, melon and mild citrus flavors, while the finish is fresh enough despite being fleshy. Simple but fine; drink immediately.",Spain,Viura
"In no way is this up to the high standards of other Tirants. The 2003 is overly woody and shy on the rich, saturated fruit that it's supposed to deliver. It's O.K., but very leafy, dry and tight.",Spain,Red Blend
"First, second and third nosings all result in the same finding: that this Cava smells a lot like lettuce. In the mouth, scattered citrus and apple flavors are acceptable, and while the mouthfeel is fine, it just doesn't hit the spot or trigger much excitement.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The sweet, oddly spicy nose stirs some intrigue, and that's likely derived from the Grenache. Yet despite reasonably good flavors, it bounces along like a truck on a gravel road. It just doesn't have much balance, mouthfeel or charm.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is appealing from the beginning, with fresh raspberry, strawberry and mineral aromas. It feels nice and bright, with flavors of citrus, pink grapefruit and green herb. Finishes with forward acidity and mild flavors of sage and tarragon.",Spain,Rosé
"Earthy and dark, this has a lot of oak, herb and carob aromas. It feels full, tannic and grating, but also creamy due to copious oak. The flavors are beefy and mildly herbal, with sweetness on the back palate. It's very oaky and bulky, with Garnacha, Shiraz and Monastrell.",Spain,Red Blend
"The lime, mineral and flower aromas are inviting. On the palate, light, powdery flavors of lime, kiwi and green melon take over. It tastes a little green on the finish, like tarragon, but overall it's fresh, dry and easy to drink. This is a blend of 40% Macabeo and 40% Parellada and 20% Sauvignon Blanc.",Spain,White Blend
"This has firm, ripe berry aromas that are a little roasted and woody. Thehe palate feels fresh, compact and bright, with earthy plum and berry flavors that carry a minerally note and a hint of leather. It's ightly herbal and toasty on the finish. A blend of 70% Monastrell with 30% Syrah.",Spain,Monastrell-Syrah
"Rubbery and gaseous smelling at first, with medicinal black-fruit aromas of blueberry and black plum. It feels syrupy and heavy, with roasted flavors of herb-tinged black fruit and mint. A full-bodied, forceful wine, with heat and herbal influences.",Spain,Garnacha
"Smells whole, so you're hopeful going in. But the palate is stark and rather raw, while the flavors of raspberry and cherry are limited. A palate slammer with harsh tannins. Tempranillo 65%/Cabernet Sauvignon 35%.",Spain,Red Blend
"Already past its prime, this Garnacha-based rosado has sweet nectarine aromas along with a sugary, creamy palate. If it had more zest upon release, that's mostly gone at this stage. Wait for the 2006.",Spain,Garnacha
"Campo de Borja can produce some strange wines, and at the head of the class would be this rooty, tomato-laden wine that's at one point sweet but then bland and cooked at the next. A varietal Garnacha from a hot vintage that just isn't worth the price.",Spain,Garnacha
"Burnt and seemingly weedy at first, this heavily oaked 100% Garnacha is initially downright weird and baked. In the final analysis it's all wood and medicinal fruit. Not a personal favorite.",Spain,Garnacha
"Initial sweet-plum aromas are as good as it gets. Raisin enters the picture, and eventually you've got a  heavy, clumsy, overly ripe wine that tastes and smells mostly of sappy oak and coconut.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cloudy red in color, with musky berry aromas. The palate shows some cherry and raspberry, while the feel is sort of rough. A classic country wine that isn't about to rock anyone's world.",Spain,Tempranillo
"No matter how you slice this up, it comes out smelling and tasting sharp and burnt. The nose is brambly and fiery, while the mouth is peppery and rough. Hard and jagged at every turn, thus you need the pan y arroz (bread and rice), to absorb the wine's kick.",Spain,Red Blend
"Prune and other overweight aromas carry the nose, and the palate is raisiny. Not rough by any means, but a lot of dead weight drags it down.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Heavy and quite herbal, with strong tomato and molasses flavors. The feel of this wine is chunky and broad, yet the edges are sheer and sharp. It requires too much patience and shows too many flaws to rate better.",Spain,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is over the hill and showing mostly vegetal papaya and green melon aromas and flavors. There's not much spunk or style left, so wait for the 2006 and drink that wine upon release; Fransola has never aged well.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Red plum, rubber and leathery aromas lead to a dry, medium-full palate, with peppery spice and red fruit flavors. It's spicy on the finish, with modest depth of flavor and little to no variety in texture. A good but regular Monastrell.",Spain,Monastrell
"Ripe but basic on the nose, this has dusty apple and sweet, minerally notes that are not sugary. It feels a little blowsy, but there's ample acidic cut to frame the dry, flavors of melon, green banana and apple. This has a simple finish. A blend of 80% Xarello and 20% Riesling.",Spain,White Blend
"Slightly earthy and rubbery smelling, with a pinch of wet dog fur on the nose. It feels full and hefty, with sweet blackberry flavors leading to a round, sweet finish. This is solid and easy to like.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells gritty and herbal on first take, with roasted, leafy aromas. The herb and red fruit flavors are a bit spotty, remaining herbal and mildly green on the finish, with snappy acidity.",Spain,Cabernet Franc
"Light salmon in color, this has aromas of pineapple, passion fruit and tangerine. It feels tangy and zesty, with pithy, crisp flavors of citrus fruits and red berries. It's juicy, but not overly flavorful on the finish.",Spain,Rosé
"A bit heavy and corny, with a strong influence of tortilla and corn chips on the nose. On the palate, it's crisp, with modest flavors of salt, baked apple and dried papaya. Dry, mellow and ultimately short on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Smoky and roasted on the nose, it also has standard red-berry aromas lurking in the background. This feels fairly full and healthy, with sweet-oak flavors accenting lightly-pickled-tasting red berry. It finishes a bit herbal, with lasting minty, oaky flavors.",Spain,Red Blend
"Bacon, rubber and berry fruit aromas comprise the bouquet. Feels crisp on the palate, with roasted berry flavors and herb and pepper accents. It feels warm on the finish, with herbal leanings and some roughness.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is big and bacony on the nose, with herbal berry aromas and notes of spice and more. It feels lifted and nervy, with vital, almost volatile acidity and resiny, oak-led flavors of vanilla and black fruit. This is minty, spicy and aggressive on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is bulky on the nose, with meaty, rubbery aromas. It feels more snappy and acidic on the tongue, with zesty acids pushing tomato, red plum and herb flavors. Long and steady on the finish, with additional tomato-based tang.",Spain,Garnacha
"Stretched and woody on the nose, with not much fruit. It feels wide, grabby and tannic, with leathery, herbal berry flavors. Grabby on the finish, this is still quite tannic and a bit tough on the palate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty, chunky peach and apple aromas find a second gear with airing. This feels round, with mild acidity and flavors that range from apple and citrus to sweet banana. The finish is mostly smooth and full flavored, albeit sweet.",Spain,Verdejo
"This is a bit wayward and cheesy on the nose, but on the palate it's good and smooth. It tastes sweet, with a burnt brown-sugar flavor and mild bitterness on the back palate. The finish is sweet and slightly maderized.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Jammy and mildly baked on the bouquet, with cinnamon, matchstick and blueberry aromas. It's full and tannic, with a mix of stewed fruit, brown sugar, spice and tomato making up the flavor profile. The woody and chunky finish has herb and tomato notes.",Spain,Bobal
"Hickory smoke and rubber band aromas control the nose. It feels stretched and acidic, with zesty plum and raspberry flavors. Oaky vanilla and creamy flavors surface, which lead to a long but undistinguished finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"A bit oily on the bouquet, this has slightly acrid notes of burnt hay and matchstick, with notes of apple and nectarine. It feels full and not edgy, with good acidity and limited flavors of baked apple and peach. A standard Penedès wine made from 80% Xarello, with Malvasia and Macabeo.",Spain,White Blend
"Rather unusual smelling, with exotic spice and blue fruit aromas that aren't cut from the normal cloth. It feels rubbery, with black plum, cumin and licorice flavors. Dark and fruity on the finish, it has warm notes of spice covering every angle. A blend of Garnacha, Monastrell, Samso and Syrah.",Spain,Red Blend
"Sassy right off the bat, with feline aromas and juniper. Feels wet, bouncy and soda-like, with a mix of prickly green-fruit flavors and sweetness. There's more of the same on the finish; it's briny and melony sweet.",Spain,Verdejo
"Subtle and sweet on the nose, it has aromas of honey, peach and melon. Standard nettle, gooseberry and slightly-mealy citrus flavors mark the palate. This finishes chunky yet easygoing. Drink immediately.",Spain,Verdejo
"This has berry fruit aromas that don't fully register as crisp and spunky. It feels narrow and tastes tart and tangy, with red plum and cherry pie flavors. Punchy and refreshing.",Spain,Rosé
"The earthy-smelling aromas of red berry and plum are snappy and rustic. It feels fresh, zesty and deep, with bright but basic tasting berry flavors that transition to chocolate and herb before the scratchy feeling finish. This is a good wine with moderate depth and complexity.",Spain,Monastrell
"Rugged and roasted on the bouquet, with rubbery blackberry and freshly laid tar aromas. It feels big and solid, but simple, with raspberry, strawberry and a hint of green herb on the palate. The finish is mild tasting, with a cocoa note.",Spain,Garnacha-Monastrell
"Narrow and fiery on the nose, this has plum and raspberry aromas. On the palate, it feels snappy and crisp, with a mild lactic note alongside flavors of light herb, raspberry, plum and buttery oak.",Spain,Grenache Blend
"Standard berry and cherry aromas set up a fresh, fairly balanced and medium-weight palate with raspberry, red plum and oak flavors on the back end. It's mild on the finish, with snappy acidity that causes shortness.",Spain,Garnacha
"This opens with smoky, rubbery aromas along with dark berry and cherry scents. It feels fresh and lively, with good body weight and forward, candied flavors of cherry and raspberry. The finish is nice, with cocoa notes and lasting sweetness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Very sweet on the nose, this has aromas of prune, raisin and nutmeg. It feels surprisingly acidic given the sweet-leaning aromas, with full tannins and berry and smoky oak flavors. The finish is tasty and long.",Spain,Monastrell
"Red in color, with sweet aromas of sugar beet, Red Delicious apple and cherry. It feels zesty, with simple flavors of red fruit and red apple. The finish is dry and a touch peppery. Drink immediately while it's fresh.",Spain,Rosé
"Dark, meaty and ripe, the bouqiet has a strong wave of herb and carob notes. It feels grabby almost to the point of cloying, with heavily oaked flavors of roasted black fruit and milk chocolate. This is oak dominated, but full and chocolaty.",Spain,Garnacha
"Charcoal, cola and menthol aromas sit on top of blueberry and mint. The mouth is so tannic and powerful that it's tough to swallow. Incredibly ripe, this has a short finish that's toasty tasting and not complex in the least.",Spain,Petite Verdot
"This is dark in color, with pushy aromas of wild field, prune and vinegar. Wide, chunky and heavy, it has flavors of black fruit, mint and green herb. It's full but soft on the finish, with pruny accents.",Spain,Garnacha
"Beefy and roasted up front, without much lift to the bouquet. The palate is marked with high acidity but also some texture, while the flavors run toward salty tomato, herb, baked berry and a hint of brown sugar. It's crisp and tangy on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Cherry and plum aromas come with a dusty note, however things turn sharper and more brambly with airing. It feels citrusy and choppy, with sweet-and-sour flavors of raspberry and red plum. Juicy, but fiery on the finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"Roasted and rubbery on the nose, this has herb and leaf accents. It feels thick, chunky and a bit syrupy, with flavors of herb, mint and roasted blackberry. This turns grittier on the finish, with bacon, hickory and rubbery flavors. A blend of 50% Monastrell and 50% Syrah.",Spain,Monastrell-Syrah
"Stalky and sweet smelling, this has aromas of beets and rhubarb pie. The palate offers weight, depth and a firm feel, with sweet berry flavors that come with herb and mint accents. It's warm on the finish, with length.",Spain,Garnacha
"Opens with tolerable green tobacco and green bean aromas interspersed with black-fruit notes and earth. It feels astringent and supertannic, with leathery, herbal berry flavors. Same on the finish, which is rough in feel and tastes herbal.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet and heavily oaked, with candied fruit, loads of vanilla and milk chocolate-covered raisin aromas. Feels choppy on one hand and lactic on the other, with mostly oak-based, sweet flavors of maple, vanilla and mocha. Feels O.K. but creamy on the finish, and it tastes candied and artificial throughout.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Flourescent pink in color, like Day-Glo paint. It smells of sweet plum and berry; the palate is crisply acidic, with citrus and tart red-fruit flavors. The finish is crisp and cleansing but regular.",Spain,Rosé
"Gritty, toasty and burnt smelling, with stalky aromas of burning hay and rubber. It feels solid, with herbal flavors of tomato and basil that are given heft via additional flavors of grilled beef and leather. This has a medium-long on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"This is lightly baked and sweet on the nose, with a hint of plastic and raisin as the bouquet opens. It feels fresh and a bit sharp, with tangy red-plum and currant flavors followed by bland oak. The finish is tart and acidic.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is mustardy smelling, with salad-like aromas. It feels round, plump and a little heavy, with spiced apple and mild citrus flavors. Chunky in feel and briny in taste on the finish. Not as good as past vintages.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dusty red-fruit aromas come with earthy, leathery tones. It feels tight, drawn and resiny, with hard spice and oak flavor. There's not much fruit to ponder, and the finish is dried out, with a woody note.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Broken up on the nose, with a nutty, leafy set of over-the-hill aromas. Feels soupy, with hard acids and flavors of tomato, herbs and heavy sweetness. It shows a few good qualities but not enough to rate better.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Burnt and leathery smelling, with aromas of earth, rubber and baked fruit. It feels rough and grabby, with dry spice, cinnamon and roasted berry flavors. The finish is abrasive, with some warmth.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Soft and stewy up front, without a whole lot of vigor. It feels wide and hard, with abrasive tannins and strained flavors of herbal berry and leather. On the finish it's earthy, tannic and warm, with a weedy note along with barrel spice.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This is cedary and dry smelling, with more spice than fruit aromas. It feels crisp, tight and acidic, with flavors of raspberry, red plum and forced spice coming from the heavy oak. Dry, oaky and spicy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Herbal to the max, with strong bell pepper and pimiento aromas. It feels clacky, with salty, herbal flavors of blackberry and dark plum. Warm almost to the point of being hot on the finish, with burnt notes as well as acidic zip.",Spain,Red Blend
"As it smells blowsy, stalky and oily, this is probably already past its freshness point. It feels chunky and sort of flat, with mealy apple flavors leading to a honeyed finish that feels fleshy. This is a blend of 50% Viura, 40% Chardonnay and 10% Muscat.",Spain,White Blend
"Quiet up front, with dull, candied aromas of black cherry and plum. This feels bullish and grabby, with clipped, crisp flavors of red plum and cherry pie filling. Fresh, but it comes up short on flavor on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Floral and fruity smelling, this also has notes of dry earth and asphalt. It feels tangy and tomatoey, with saucy flavors of red cherry, tomato and herbs. The finish is herbal, with flavors of oregano and rosemary amplified by zingy acidity.",Spain,Garnacha
"With aromas of milk-chocolate-covered cherries and forced oak, this smells overtly sweet and candied. This feels choppy and juicy, with red fruit flavors and buttery oak in the background. It turns sweeter and more buttery on the finish, but doesn't offer much complexity.",Spain,Grenache Blend
"A funky, lean wine that's all over the place. The nose is fiery, with cardamom and notes of sweet peppers and candied berries. It feels clampy but juicy, with flavors of cumin, cardamom, sour plum and raspberry. It finishes acidic.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stemmy, earthy aromas of cherry and hard spice lead to a rough palate with hard cherry and berry flavors. It blackens up on a pounding finish; this is edgy and rough stuff.",Spain,Tempranillo
Mild raspberry and tomato aromas precede a grabby-feeling wine with sandpaper tannins and flavors of medicinal plum and tomato. It comes across loud but raw and unrefined.,Spain,Tempranillo
"This is rubbery smelling, with distinct whiffs of leather and grilled meat. Sheer, tangy and acidic, this has a burnt, gritty flavor that blends with cherry and tart plum. It's minty and somewhat dilute on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromas of white pepper and nettle are about as fresh as it gets. The rest is falling off, with bitterness and oxidation. Acceptable but bland and bitter on the tail end.",Spain,Verdejo
"Stalky aromas give off the impression of corn and funk. It feels ultrasnappy, with medicinal fruit, forced oak and berry flavors that don't really click. The finish is grating and slightly bitter.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells flat and stewy, with jammy sweetness and little punch. Conversely, it's pointy on the palate, with tart, generic red-berry flavors and warmth on the finish. A blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fresh on the nose, with red cherry and apple skin aromas. This feels rather sharp and acidic, with flavors of tart cherry pie and red plum.",Spain,Garnacha
"A touch of vinegar and volatility sits atop the nose, but there's fruit and weight under the surface. It feels tannic and slightly sour, with sharp acidity pushing zesty flavors of tomato, red cherry, red plum and herbs. Tasted twice with inconsistent results; this note reflects both wines that were tried.",Spain,Mencía
"Tan in color, this has fleshy, almondy aromas. It feels flat and creamy, with soft, lightly oxidized flavors of mealy apple and walnut oil. This is past its prime.",Spain,Verdejo
"A soupy sort of wine with raisiny aromas. It tastes salty and feels astringent, with tomato, herb and brothy flavors. The mouthfeel is the best part.",Spain,Syrah
"This is gritty, burnt and stalky smelling. On the palate it's sour and underdeveloped as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"This smells of latex and cinnamon. On the palate it's light and lean, with dilute flavors of cherry pie and unusual Middle Eastern spice. Grating and acidic on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Burnt and gritty smelling, with rubbery, meaty berry aromas that turn candied and herbal with airing. This feels hollow, with roasted, stalky flavors and buttery young oak. It's grabby on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"This starts with aromas of cinnamon, hard candy and weedy red fruits. It feels sugary and broken, with candied strawberry flavors in front of a sweet, confected finish.",Spain,Syrah-Grenache
"Murky and stewy smelling, with no vitality and overt green accents. It's a bit heavy in feel, with salsa-like flavors of tomato, tomatillo, chili pepper and herbs.",Spain,Garnacha
"This smells like compost. It feels hard and clacky, with sharp acidity and weedy, minty flavors that finish rough and green.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pungent up front, with dry bayberry, leather, jam notes and schisty minerality. The palate is all about structure, snappy acids, sinewy tannins and lively, full-force red-fruit and plum flavors. Like in the past, this is a top-notch Priorato that holds its form through the acid-driven finish. Best from 2011–2015.",Spain,Red Blend
"With spice, raisin and driving dark-fruit aromas, this sweetie is lifted and enticing on the bouquet. Big, rowdy and complex in the mouth, with layered cherry, cough drop and kirsch flavors. Very pure late, with coffee, chocolate and even more spice to the finish. Shows good fruit, acids, heft and overall balance. Delicious and highly recommended.",Spain,Red Blend
"Tight, pure and just right from start to finish. The nose offers bold berry, roasted plum, vanilla and spice aromas along with exceptional clarity, and the palate is snappy and pure but also dark and loaded with coffee, chocolate, mocha and fine raspberry and cherry flavors. Slightly oaky but smooth late, and composed. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little heavy at first, but airing reveals a robust and stirring bouquet of plum and berry aromas mixed with coffee and leather. The palate is pure and deep, with a lush set of blackberry, ripe plum and berry syrup flavors. Shows a fine structure, a long and warm finish, and the potential to age another 5–8 years.",Spain,Red Blend
"Smells slightly exotic and different from the norm; the nose offers baked black-fruit scents, lemon peel, rubber and Eastern spices. Pure and driving on the palate, with good acidity and woodsy, complex flavors of blackberry, coffee and licorice. Snappy and pure on the finish; drink from 2011 through 2016.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of bold black cherry, leather, bacon and sandalwood scream “modern,” yet its age renders it a bit classical. The palate is mildly woody but the flavors or creamy vanilla, dill and balsamic berry fruits are excellent. Toasty and full of coffee and depth on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little tight on the nose, with earthy characteristics as well as raspberry and plum aromas. The palate is juicy and offers good flow, while the flavors of raspberry and plum are classic and touched up by vanilla, spice, dill and toastiness. Long on the finish, with tobacco, spice and cocoa. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Very pretty aromatics of blackberry, vanilla, tobacco, spice and coffee draw you in. The palate is lush and deep, with black fruit, cola and integrated spice flavors. Concentrated and smooth, and already approachable with roasted fig and an extra dose of black fruit on the finish. Drink from 2011–2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With aromas of moss, balsam wood, baked berry and earth, this is a complex, interesting Rioja that's overdelivering for $20. The palate is lush, soft and easy, but also pure and flavorful as the fruit runs deep and meaty. Finishing notes of licorice, dark spice and lasting berry fruit will make you happy you went here. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Meaty, earthy and dark, with a powerful consitution along with briar and sharpness. In the mouth, it's a touchy customer with biting tannins, but as it unfolds you get a dark palate of black fruit, coffee, chocolate and spice. Big in flavor but not as complete or lush as in the past, which is a reflection of the vintage. Drink now through 2016.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Intriguing but expensive sweet wine, with leather and dried cheese aromas as well as dusty, rubbery black fruits and licorice. It's not that unusual or exciting in terms of mouthfeel, but the flavors of cassis liqueur, stewed cherry and black licorice are tight and powerful. Structured to last another decade, with meaty tannins and molasses on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"A fresh and appealing style of Rioja with aromas of dried cheese, dill, cedar, tobacco and kirsch. The palate has a pleasing juiciness and layered flavors of cherry, rapsberry and vanilla. Mocha and coffee flavors accent the well-oaked finish, and overall this is pure and kicking, but not too hefty or extracted. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big and forceful, with dark, penetrating aromas of oak, cedar, stocky blackberry and spice. The palate is pure and deep, with savory plum, berry, herb, vanilla and tea flavors. Finishes smooth and classy, with a dry, clean ending. Gets it right; a very good Bierzo red for under $20.",Spain,Mencía
"There are few points of reference for this hugely intense sweet Monastrell. It's deep and purple, with concentrated, fresh raisin aromas, licorice and berry syrup. Entirely rich and unctuous, with caramel, toffee and reduced berry flavors. Like P.X. but red; serve with chocolate and/or a smooth, potent cheese.",Spain,Monastrell
"Light, elegant and hinting at lemon-lime on the bouquet. The mouth is mellow, complete and not the least bit aggressive, with peach and melon flavors that turn drier and mildly pithy on the finish. Well-executed and elegant cava, but simple in its totality because it's brut nature.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Not on a par with the inaugural 2007, but for a rough year this wine brings about as much as it can. The nose is woody, deep, balsamic and herbal, while the body is thick and saturated, with roasted berry, coffee and bitter chocolate flavors. The finish lacks length and character, but it has heft and feel. A commendable effort for a poor vintage.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Stocky and kind of big on the bouquet, with broad, fat berry fruit aromas and some jamminess. The palate is saturated and jammy, with thick blackberry flavors and roasted fig. Chunky and on the verge of being syrupy, but still really nice in a rich, easy way. Drink now and over the next couple of years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pretty aromatics that include floral notes, light coffee, berry and cherry are just right, and the mouth is juicy and driving, with slightly astringent acids that propel strawberry, raspberry, vanilla and dill flavors. Smooth on the finish despite the wine's vital acidity, and ready to drink with an array of foods.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raisin and other sweet, soft aromas are friendly but don't really bring it. The palate follows suit; it's chubby and jammy, with sweet berry flavors, a touch of raisin and a roasted, candied finish. Very nice and true to the region, albeit on the soft and easy side.",Spain,Red Blend
"Just sweet and soft enough to temper the wine's more citric, minerally side. Aromas of green pear and melon are basic and welcoming, while the snappy, forward palate is cleansing and fresh. Flavors of green melon, apple, saline and honey scream Rías Baixas.",Spain,Albariño
"Not a lot of glaring aromas of a sweet wine here; in fact, it's showing fresh tomato, cherry and more dryness on the nose than candy or syrup. The palate is tight and a little clipped, with sweet cassis and reduced black plum flavors. Short on the finish, but good and grabby overall.",Spain,Grenache
"Big, chunky and dark on the nose, but smells monotone except for a floral hint. The palate shows nice body, saturation and grabby tannins to go with oak-infused flavors of black plum, cola and spice. Savory and rooty on the finish. A good restaurant wine, either by the glass or bottle.",Spain,Red Blend
"Marqués de Cáceres intentionally lowered the amount of new oak on this barrel-fermented Viura, and the result is positive. The nose is smooth and slightly creamy, but not oaky or resiny smelling. Composed and balanced across the tongue, with orange, lime, nectarine and toasty flavors. Quite good for barrel-fermented white Rioja.",Spain,White Blend
"Opens with mossy aromas that are soon replaced by foresty oak and murky black-fruit notes. The palate has enough thickness and concentration to register as true Toro, while the flavors of berry fruit, herbs and spice cover the bases. Oaky and lightly tannic on the finish, and just beefy and chewy enough.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"The best Paso a Paso white yet; it's ripe and smells of pineapple and melon, while the palate is pure and has a solid feel. Flavors of apple, peach and pithy citrus are honest, and the finish is clean. Delivers what it should and more.",Spain,Verdejo
"More up the ladder from Vitoria's crianza, but also more raisiny and oaky. The wine develops nicely with air, shedding raisin for more of the fruit spectrum. Meanwhile, the oak is strong and obvious, leaving vanilla, toast and spice on the finish. Otherwise, it has the same flavor profile and acidic kick as the crianza. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite ripe and dark, with blackberry, raisin and aromas of woody spice manifested as cinnamon. The palate shows a controlled sharpness and then flavors of saturated berry fruit accented by oak-based notes of vanilla and dill weed. A powerful, deep style of crianza with a lot of oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little rusty in color and somewhat transparent, with raisin as the key aroma. There's not a lot going on in the mouth, but the wine is mellow and deep, with sweet flavors of molasses, berry syrup and baked black fruits. Rich and candied, but rather sweet and a touch dull for Priorat. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Very friendly and clean cava with good fruit and a pinch of aromatic toast. It's far from out of the ordinary, but it is extremely fresh and clean, with pure lemon-lime and green apple on the palate. Finishes fruity and with finesse. Really good in an uncomplicated way.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Beefy, stocky aromas also bring herb, tomato and berry notes. The palate is jumpy and slightly medicinal, with currant, tomato, herb and plum flavors running the show. Medium in size, with level tannins and a juicy, good overall feel to it.",Spain,Mencía
"Leafy, roasted and herbal up front, with modest ripe-fruit aromas sitting below. The palate smacks down hard with tannin and acidity, while the flavors are leafy, herbal and suggest raspberry and cherry. Prieto Picudo is a unique grape with a natural rubbery bite, but give Peregrino credit for presenting it well.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"A bit mulchy but also displaying power and quality for an under-$10 wine. The nose is initially murky but evolves toward sweet, simple berry fruit. Meanwhile, the palate is ripe, bouncy, lively and solid, with cherry, plum and chocolaty flavors. Slightly big and rubbery but convincing as a whole.",Spain,Mencía
"Satisfying from the purple color to the sweet bouquet to the clean palate to the long finish. It's a little simple and syrupy, but overall there's plenty of freshening acidity and flavors of plum, berry and chocolate to make it a complete and balanced wine. And that's really all you should hope for in this price category.",Spain,Monastrell
"Rubbery and roasted, but not too much so. Otherwise one should look for medicinal berry aromas followed by flavors of baked plum, prune and black pepper. The finish is dense, a touch flat, and chocolaty; overall this is a chunky, sweet performer.",Spain,Monastrell
"One of the most cutting, acid-intense Albariños out there. The nose in minerally and tight as a drum, with green melon and green apple scents. The palate is razor sharp and driving, with tangy, high-toned lemon and Granny Smith apple flavors. Totally citric and zesty; it will last another few years.",Spain,Albariño
"Clean and inviting, but simple, with apple and fresh-herb aromas. The palate is properly crisp yet not sharp, and the flavors of green apple and white grapes are snappy. Regular and a little better than good in every way, but ultimately more basic than special.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dark, smoky, heavily oaked and resiny, with aromas of char, leather and burnt toast. The palate is big and forceful, with a lot of oak character and also snappy blackberry, plum and buttery flavors. Modern and creamy, with enough quality fruit to back things up.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fiery to start, with spice and herbal fruit aromas. The palate is juicy, lively and healthy in feel, with berry, plum and spice flavors. Finishes herbal and a little leafy, and there's not as much stuffing as you'd expect for a Toro red. On the plus side, it's manageable and not overweight.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Yellow-gold in color, with baked fruit, butterscotch, creamed corn and wood resin aromas. Forcefully oaked and massive in the mouth, with enough sporty acidity to prop up the woodspice, nutmeg and resiny flavors that render the fruit secondary. Much like chewing on an oak plank, structured and layered.",Spain,White Blend
"Opens with rubber, smoke, leather and coffee aromas, then the fruit comes in on the palate, which is juicy and correct, with tight, fresh red-fruit flavors and notes of ripe tomato and pepper flake. Finishes spicy and dry, with a crispness that'll make it 100% food-friendly.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This “basic” Tierra de León wine made from the obscure Prieto Picudo grape outshines Pricum's higher-priced bottlings. It has a leathery nose with mild baked-berry flavors, while the palate is tight but not astringent. Flavors of toamto, red currant, raspberry and herbs are snappy, and overall it's textured and long in the mouth.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"The bouquet of cherry and raspberry is sprightly and mildly leafy, with hints of leather and dried cheese. The palate is whispy, with red-fruit flavors of raspberry and plum along with mild herbal notes, cocoa powder and dry spice. A basic, lighter-bodied Rioja with a traditional tilt.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Another fine Best Buy from a winery that knocks 'em out year after year. This Monastrell-Syrah blend delivers full, rustic aromas of tomato, baked berry and salsa. The palate is saucy and smooth, with blackberry flavors mixed with herbs and tomato. Textured, healthy, snappy and a good partner for full-  flavored foods.",Spain,Red Blend
"Slightly fiery and hot on the nose, but there's enough berry, cherry and dusty leather to keep it positive. The palate is more sheer and sharp than expected, with piercing raspberry, razor's edge acidity and only a touch of back-end sweetness. Juicy but short and searing.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, juniper berry and dust are slightly sharp but do manage to fold together into a solid whole. The palate is correct, with green-leaning, semiherbal flavors of melon, papaya and mango. A good to above-average Albariño that should be drunk right away.",Spain,Albariño
"Fairly pungent, with apple and lemon aromas that are typical for the variety. The palate has an edge to it and jacked-up acidity that pushes citrus and pineapple flavors toward tangy. With so much citrus character and acidity, it's lasting and scouring.",Spain,Albariño
"A solid rendition of Verdejo with apple and pear aromas along with basic minerality. The palate is standard and firm, with good acidity pushing apple and citrus flavors. Perfectly competent but not showing the nuances and higher qualities that would justify a $17 outlay.",Spain,Verdejo
"Basic and a little sweet and confected, but consider the price and you should be smiling. There's some bramble and pepper to the nose, but mostly it's just ripe and full of blackberry and black plum character. Candied and almost cloying, but remains flush and happy. Good in the midlevel category.",Spain,Monastrell
"Slightly rubbery on first impression, but cleaner and better as it opens up. Zesty and full of acidic punch, with juicy black cherry and plum flavors. Registers as healthy and ripe, with a spot of medicinality. Quite good for the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Spiced berry aromas are dense and suggest raisin, but overall this is a clean, inexpensive blend of Garnacha and Tempranillo that is satisfying and highly competent. Flavors run smoky, rubbery and dark, but not baked or too heavy. Toasty and roasty on the finish, too.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark and rubbery on the nose, but also lightly leafy and herbal, with oak and coffee for cover up. The palate is good but slightly rough and narrow, and the flavors are not as deep and developed as they have been in the past. Plum, berry and herbal flavors are good but lead to a short, modest finish. Vintage 2008 was not a good one, and this wine reflects that.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Rubbery and a little gaseous on first pass, with medicinal berry emerging later on the nose. The palate is structured and reasonably good, with cherry and raspberry flavors that are fresh, lightly extracted and well spiced. Finishes with just a hint of creaminess.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raisin, black plum and peppery aromas make for a good bouquet, and the palate is healthy and dark, with snappy black cherry and blackberry flavors floating on a current of zesty acidity. Full on the finish, but still there's some acidic scour. Best with food.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with aromas of burnt leaves, roasted bell pepper and tomato and finally secondary red fruit. The palate is saturated but hard, with herbal, leafy, dry red-fruit flavors and a backing of cured meat. Herbal late, with some old-school cherry and tobacco. A tough wine, but at least it's something different.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"Aromas of tobacco, mild raisin, dry oak and berries are simple and pleasant, while the palate is light in weight, a touch dilute but very fresh and easy, with cherry, plum and even some citrus for flavor. Light and transparent on the finish, with barely any excess.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The question is: How scouring and razor's edge do you like it? If you like it sharp but clean, then this is a winner. It's minerally and green in style, with Granny Smith apple and lime on the palate and finish. Juicy, crisp and bone dry Viura.",Spain,White Blend
"Peachy up front, with a pithy, dry, diluteness to the nose. The palate is wet but a little bland and innocuous, with nectarine, generic citrus and pith flavors. For a blend of Viura, Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc, it works well enough.",Spain,White Blend
"Zesty on the nose and pulsing with white-fruit aromas, and that opening is backed by a spritzy, lively body that brings lemon-lime and soda-like flavors. Melony and green on the finish, and good overall in a simple, tropical sort of way.",Spain,Macabeo-Moscatel
"Tropical on the nose, with lychee fruit and tangerine aromas. The palate is easygoing and fairly thorough, while the flavor profile suggest Argentine Torrontés as it deals lychee, powdered sugar and papaya. Clean, light, quaffable and that's about it.",Spain,Macabeo-Chardonnay
"Tomato, savory spice and earthy, mildly stewed red-fruit aromas lead to a crisp palate with firm acids and flavors of tomato, raspberry, herbs, vanilla and dried cheese. Lasting but light on the finish. Contains 30% Gracianio, which helps explain the sheer, red-fruit character.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Hefty and rubbery on the bouquet, with black-fruit aromas and some dustiness. The palate is fresh feeling, with full acidity and a mildly stretched set of lively berry and roasted flavors. Comes up a bit short and hollow on the finish, but good all totaled.",Spain,Red Blend
"Opens with burnt, rubbery aromas that eventually cede to asphalt, roasted peanut and leather. The palate is soft and a bit hollow in the middle, with earthy, rubbery flavors of black plum and berry. Finishes with cola, bitter coffee and root beer flavors. Decent and full overall, but rubbery.",Spain,Red Blend
"For a sweet wine, it's clean, light and airy, with pear and powdered sugar on the nose. The flavors are definitely sweet but the feel isn't particularly sticky, and the finishing flavors of candied fruit, vanilla and honeydew are good. Made from late-harvest Viura and Malvasia.",Spain,White Blend
"Slightly minty and grassy on the nose, and that mild green character persists. The palate is a bit clacky and acidic, yet the flavors evolve and ultimately rest at candied and medicinal. A touch biting but it tastes pretty good and it's decidedly not sour. A blend of 55% Monastrell with 25% Cabernet Savuignon and 20% Syrah.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mildy green tobacco aromas lead the way along with forest floor, fern notes and standard berry aromas. The palate opens with forceful acidity, while the flavors are a bit underdeveloped as they lean toward blackberry. Mild bitterness is also part of the picture as the wine flattens out on the back side.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy and rubbery on the nose, and rather dark for a $10 Rioja. The palate is jammy and solid, with berry flavors, a hint of toast and heat. The finish is somewhat burning, but overall it's a legit blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha that fits the “value” mold.",Spain,Red Blend
"A simple and snappy style of Rioja with just enough weight and ripeness along with light berry aromas. The palate is perky and fresh, with young, medicinal, semisharp flavors of cherry and plum. More than competent, with verve and acidic scour.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Medicinal, sweet and short on complexity for a wine of this price. The palate has a choppy, rough feel and then comes an onslaught of medicinal berry flavor that leads to a tight, biting finish that's big on acid and low on depth of flavor and intracacies you might expect for $80. More of a novelty wine; 160 cases made.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"Richer and more grapey than the Valdorramiro 2008, but also friendlier, deeper and more complete. Aromas of blackberry, vanilla and sweet spices lead to a structured, weighty palate full of spicy, oak-driven berry and plum flavors. Clove notes and length define the finish. Drink from 2014–2019",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Raspberry, cranberry, schist and wild brush aromas are about as correct for Priorat as you'll find. In the mouth, this wine from Sara Pérez and René Barbier Jr. is lively, racy and pure, with red berry, vanilla, coconut and tobacco flavors. Finishes long and elegant. Drink through 2016; 166 cases made.",Spain,Red Blend
"Neutral on the nose, and then crisp but bland tasting. There's apple and green hints of fresh bell pepper and lettuce, while the finish shows lime, citrus pith and mild bitterness. Light and basic; made from 50% each of Airen and Macabeo (Viura).",Spain,White Blend
"Lemony and citrusy from the get-go, with floral notes to the nose. The palate is sheering and tart, with edgy tannins. As a whole, it's angular, with tomato and red-fruit flavors. A natural, jacked-up example of Prieto Picudo that's a bit underwhelming.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"Dry, minty and spicy, with cool, lightweight berry and cola aromas. The palate is fairly light and easy, with lean red-fruit flavors, dry spice and a creamy tasting accent. Spice more than fruit carries the finish. Pedestrian wine that's competent.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Earthy and mildly medicinal smelling, with a healthy, not too stark palate that's dealing pointed cherry flavors and some dry oak. It's a touch sharp and angular, with a dry, peppery finish that's lean, acid-driven and starching.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Smells oily, stemmy and a bit funky, while the palate is sweet in the extra dry mold, with candied white-fruit, vanilla and powdered sugar flavors. The finish is warm and sweet, with a fast fade. More candied and sweet than fruity or exact.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Quiet and shy on the nose, with generic white-fruit notes. For a medium-dry white, it offers requisite sweetness along with soft fruit notes, candied flavors and a green, lightly vegetal accent. A bit spritzy but not that lively or precise.",Spain,Verdejo
"Grassy on the nose, and for a brut nature this is decidedly flat in aromas, with ultradry flavors of lime and tangerine along with powdery vanilla. Super light on the finish, which dissipates in no time. Almost tart and lacking in the long run.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Blowsy and mustardy, like it's starting to turn south. The palate is loud, jumbled and heavy, with mustardy orange flavors, a touch of flowery honey and then bitterness. Big and powerful, but not very poised.",Spain,Albariño
"Tanning in color, with stalky, semimealy aromas that lack zap and citric crispness. The body is heavy, although there's adequate acidity, while the flavors lean toward mealy citrus and ripe melon. Pithy and bitter on the finish, like almond skins.",Spain,Macabeo
"Sweet and funky smelling, with a weird set of aromas that suggest Middle Eastern spice and hard-to-gauge fruit. The palate feel is barely acceptable, while the flavors are jumbled and overtly spicy and strange. Maybe it's the oak? Or maybe it's just not very good wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A passionfruit-dominated wine without much else besides a fresh, almost watery palate feel. This is a one-trick pony that's all passionfruit except for some pineapple juice and mango sorbet. Wet, zesty and tropical but only moderately pleasant.",Spain,Viura
"Roasted, rubbery primary aromas turn herbal, while the palate is classic Navarran in that it's tomatoey, with herbal cherry flavors and a leafy juniper character. Simple and short late, with a slightly sour, herbal finish.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Based on experience, Zumaya's wines just aren't at the high level that Ribera del Duero is known for. This is herbal and foxy, with roasted, leafy aromas leading to an underwhelming palate of tomato, stewed red fruit and vanilla. Saucy on the finish, and ultimately okay but not up to par.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Serious wine for serious Ribera lovers, even if it's from a generally weak vintage. Smells of bacon grease, graphite and dark berry fruits. Feels tight and youthfully tannic, with hickory, smoked meat, clove, toast and blackberry flavors. Clove and spice rest heavily on the woody finish; needs time to evolve and absorb its oak treatment. Best from 2013–2018.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Dark as night, with charcoal, campfire, sweet berry and jammy notes to the alluring bouquet. Lively on the palate, with tangy acidity propelling black fruit, sweet oak, licorice and spice flavors. Solid, well built and generally smooth. Excellent Ribera from a very good year. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Candied cherry and raspberry aromas are anything but complex or serious, while the palate is lean, sheering, crisp and more tart than flavorful. Scouring on the finish, and not really offering much of anything.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Heavy and mealy on the nose, with stalky white-fruit aromas. The palate is weighty and sticky, with a cloying feel and sweet, baked flavors of apple and honey. Then it turns distinctly bitter and pithy on the finish. Generally speaking, Calatayud is not white wine country.",Spain,Macabeo
"Smells like tarmac and tire rubber initially, and it remains stemmy and staunch even with air. The feel is dilute yet edgy, and the flavors suggest generic red berry and a dash of spice. Fades quickly on the finish, which is probably a good thing.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Hard and crusty on first impression, with smoky, leathery, meaty aromas along with hints of wild herbs and dark berry fruit. Feels racy and ultraslick, with cherry, plum and mineral flavors. Hits all the right notes while not pushing any buttons too hard or too often; long on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Red Blend
"Smells strange, with a mix of unknown spice and odd fruit aromas. The palate is snappy and sharp, with light fruit and oaky, resiny flavors that leave a lasting, confounding aftertaste. Rather pointless given all the good value-priced wines on the market.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Roasted, herbal and blunt, with an acrid stemminess. The palate lacks ripeness and elegance as it delivers burnt, leafy, herbal flavors. Underwhelming.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Nutty as they come, with a dose of honey on the bouquet. Tastes extremely nice and powerful, with cleansing acids and complex flavors of salted peanuts, almond, baked peaches and toffee. Layered in terms of feel and delivery, with a nutty, crisp finish.",Spain,Sherry
"A unique and individual style of Sherry, even among palo cortados. It's dark amber in color, with a pungent mix of aromas that include molasses, raw brown sugar, chocolate and campfire. Feels fresh on the tongue, with coffee, dark chocolate and core peach and citrus flavors.",Spain,Sherry
"Light in color, with pecan pie aromas. There's nothing heavy or blowsy about this refined palo cortado; it's tight in the mouth, with narrowing acidity and tangy, oily flavors of citrus, almond and rancio. Long as they come on the finish, with zero excess weight.",Spain,Sherry
"After it oozes rubber and bacon on the nose, berry fruit and mild medicinal aromas settle in. Feels full, tight and structured, with meat, black cherry and wild berry flavors. Finishes warm, chocolaty and lightly roasted. Well-made, and impressive for the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Full, lusty and slightly floral smelling, with notes of leather, crusty berry and hoisin sauce. Feels thick, with body and weight along with flavors of berry, cookie dough and floral hints. Long, meaty and slightly herbal on the finish, with just enough complexity to nudge it ahead. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Toasty and sweet on the nose, however it's not very complex. Feels juicy and refined, with raisin, fig and date flavors. Long on the finish and chocolaty tasting, with raisin and a lightness of being. Sweet within the style, but not unctuous or candied.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Round and welcoming up front, with toffee, caramel and mocha aromas that are not too sharp. Feels smooth, with pure flavors of toasted nuts, caramel, cocoa dust, dried apricot and underripe peach. Complex and nutty on the finish, with a sweet aftertaste of chocolate and toffee.",Spain,Sherry
"Complex, integrated and solid up front, with berry aromas, vanilla notes and toasty oak. Feels full, thick, staunch and balanced, with deep berry and cherry flavors leading to a toasty, peppery finish with leftover berry flavors. Well formed and well oaked, with excellent fruit quality. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"For affordable amontillado, this is downright excellent. Smells nutty and oily, maybe a touch sharp, but well within normal parameters. Feels fresh, round and comfortable, with lots of core fruit flavor, nuttiness, sweet toffee and caramel. Finishes with toasted pecan flavors and peanut butter notes. Semidry in style.",Spain,Sherry
"Packed tight with power and minty, earthy berry aromas that come with a dry dustiness. Feels ripe and proper, with a slight tannic grab and full but fresh flavors of wild berry, cassis, cocoa and oak. On the finish, chocolate and dry spice flavors take over, yielding a pleasant, complete whole. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pure, condensed and dark on the nose, with blasting aromas of blackberry, crusty spice and char, this is packed like an overstuffed suitcase, with flavors of jammy black fruit, fine herbs and spice. Shows more big fruit on the finish and plenty of lasting berry flavor. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Good berry aromas form a nice opening, and there are solid spice and herbal notes to boot. Feels juicy, well-cut and tighter than in years past, with blackberry, tea, spice and cured meat flavors. Oaky on the back side, but complex and showing potential. Hold through 2013, then drink.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"True as dry oloroso comes, with nutty aromas combined with caramel richness. Feels raring to go, with pumped-up acidity that boosts otherwise normal flavors of dried white fruits, mixed nuts and brine. Tight, long and driving on the finish.",Spain,Sherry
"This perennially consistent Priorato deals graphite, coconut, leather, forest and oaky, chocolaty berry aromas in front of a round, mouthfilling palate. Tastes primarily of plum, cherry and currant, with a snappy finish defined by red fruit flavors and length. Perfectly good and ready; can hold through 2014.",Spain,Red Blend
"Excellent modern Rioja at a fair price. Smells solid, with crusty minerality and toasty oak to go with black fruit aromas. Feels flush and voluminous, with jammy blackberry, baked fig and coffee flavors. Toasty, meaty and dark on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of pencil shavings, marzipan and jammy berry are sweet and slightly candied. Flavors of Bing cherry, raisin, licorice and citrus peel are forward and tight, while the finish is long and flavorful, with some acidic tang. Lively despite a mild raisiny quality. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"A meaty, bulky, earthy style of Ribera with smoky, charred, new-oak aromas setting up a reduced-seeming palate with roasted, sweet flavors of black fruits and cured meats. Feels rich, sticky and candied on the finish. Needs a couple of years to knit together; may improve with bottle age.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Blackberry aromas blend with open-grained oak to create a slightly charred bouquet. A bit acidic and edgy in feel, with a mix of herb, plum and berry flavors. Tight, juicy and a touch short on the finish, with dry, peppery spice notes. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet smelling, but welcoming and true to the cream style. Feels creamy and soft by Sherry standards, with prune, raisin, caramel, toffee and chocolate flavors. Turns a touch bitter on the finish, with a final dose of raisin, honey and toffee.",Spain,Sherry
"Pretty to sniff, with aromas of lemon, fresh white fruits and minerals. Feels crisp, chiseled and racy, with blazing acidity propelling green apple, lime, green melon and saline flavors. Long on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Concentrated aromas of berry fruits, spice and black currant jelly suggest that the wine is full and rich. In the mouth, severe tannins create a grinding sensation, while flavors of toast, blackberry, cassis and brown sugar lead to a heavy, burnt tasting finish that's blocky in feel.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Red in color, with fresh aromas of nectarine, orange peel and red currant. For a 2010 this is still fresh and sturdy, with cleansing acidity and focused flavors of citrus and red berry fruit. Eminently drinkable, with a long finish for basic rosé. Drink immediately.",Spain,Rosé
"Chunky aromas of sweet berry and beets announce a ripe style of Rioja. The mouthfeel is medium to full and healthy, with focused flavors of berry, oak and peppery spice. Long and a little fiery on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A fiery, demanding, extremely power-packed Sherry, with toffee, orange zest, pecan pie and apricot aromas. Feels tight and high in acidity, with dry, salty flavors of walnut oil and pecans. Layered and drying on the finish, with power to spare.",Spain,Sherry
"Opens with grainy, whispy aromas of reedy raspberry and smoky blackberry. Feels tannic and aggressive, so it punches ahead with lively, firm flavors of raspberry, plum and strawberry. Finishes oaky, with vanilla and dill notes. Bold Rioja to drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Earthy and subtle on the nose, with mellow leafy notes, spice and fresh red-fruit aromas. Feels lively and layered, with integrated flavors of berry fruit, oak and mocha. Creamy and long on the finish, with just enough acidity to maintain length and feel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark and bold, with leafy, slightly mulchy aromas that settle on earthy and mossy. Feels round and full, with weight, along with flavors of cola, blackberry and plum. Toasty, dark and tasting like coffee on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Standard cherry and plum aromas are fresh, clean and unadulterated by heavy oak, leather or earth notes. Feels clean and dry, with nice but standard red-berry and plum flavors. Has good flow and feel, with a light dusting of spice on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Saline and oceanic on the bouquet, but largely it's neutral-smelling. Feels tight and fresh, but tastes a bit stalky and bitter, with baked apple and a strong taste of straw. Finishes with white pepper notes and that same stalky flavor from before.",Spain,Albariño
"A nutty and acidic wine, with aromas of pressed walnuts and toffee. Feels tight, sharp and narrow on the tongue, with blazing acidity and dry, limited, salty flavors that fold in toffee and sour fruit notes. Exceedingly salty on the finish; smells great but feels and tastes astringent for such an expensive bottling.",Spain,Sherry
"Dark in color, with plum, berry and medicinal aromas. Round, full and in good shape, with dark plum, blackberry and a lot of oak for a $10 wine. Finishes creamy and big, with a spicy aftertaste. Plump and solid for value-priced Graciano.",Spain,Graciano
"Lightly spiced up front, with dry wood aromas, light cherry and floral hints. Feels juicy and tight, with basic red-plum flavors that transition quickly to spice and acidic crispness on a short finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light, minerally and showing red fruit and cocoa notes on the bouquet. Offers depth and density in support of sweet, malty, chocolaty berry flavors. Creamy, oaky and chocolaty on the finish. Uncomplicated and easy to like.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Sweet toffee, butter pecan and apricot aromas are the lead-in. This wine has a light body, decent acidity and mild flavors of burnt banana, spice and almond paste. Nutty yet basic on the finish, with a hint of mushroom.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Quiet on the nose, but by no means does it smell poor. Feels chunky, with raisin, prune, brown sugar and baked fruit flavors. Flabby but flavorful late, with a finish that tastes like caramel and chocolate powder.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Charred and burnt-smelling, and those aromas are overpowering although not necessarily bad. Feels big and tannic, with bite to go with dark flavors of bitter coffee, roasted black plum and wild berry. The charred, burnt character that controls the bouquet returns with a fury on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Fresh raspberry and plum aromas offer an inviting opening that's simple, easy and clean. That's pretty much the wine in a nutshell: it's bright and fresh, with lightly spiced red-berry and plum flavors. Focused and uncomplicated.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Floral and lightly earthy on the nose, with a touch of latex. Feels fresh and pure, with fine acidity pressing bright flavors of red cherry and raspberry. Gets toastier and darker on the finish, ending with spice and clarity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rooty and mildly sweet on the nose, then tight and zesty in the mouth, with crisp red-fruit flavors and citrusy snap. Feels entirely lean and crisp, even a bit tangy. But sometimes fresh, basic Rioja has its place.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Coconut, vanilla and dill aromas sit on top of solid berry scents to form a classic Rioja bouquet. Feels fresh and agile, with acidity that allows the wine to dance around on the palate. Tastes of red plum, raspberry, mint and spice. Seems oaky on the finish, but lively.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts with aromas of black cherry and kirsch, but turns stalky and stemmy fairly quickly. Feels crisp and a bit hard for a reserva, with herbal, zesty flavors of roasted red berry. Falls off on the finish, but maintains good quality.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Good for the style, which is sweet and lightly bubbly. Smells melony, then feels fresh and lively in the mouth. Sure, there's lots of residual sugar, but for a Moscato-type wine the tropical fruit and cotton candy flavors work well. Decidedly not cloying.",Spain,Rosé
"Sweet oak and mint aromas vie with berry fruit on the bouquet. Feels chunky, round and full, with sweet plum, ripe berry, lactic and mint notes. Falls off on the finish, which is sweet but simple.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Waxy and oily on the nose, then narrow as a thin line on the palate. Feels linear and sharp, with lemony flavors that come with a green apple accent. Tastes aged and maderized on the finish, despite displaying lemony acidity and tartness.",Spain,Albariño
"Neutral on the nose, with peachy sweetness and softness that suggests it's beginning to fade. Feels honest but light, with pithy, neutral melon and red apple flavors. Dry but sort of bland; still upright. Drink right away.",Spain,Rosé
"Baked, saucy aromas suggest the wine's overall character. It's ripe and stewy, with a grippy palate and a flavor profile full of tomato, herbs and red plum. Tastes herbal and roasted on the finish; aggressive, savory Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Smells a bit cheesy and leathery, with mint and slightly chemical berry aromas. Chewy in feel, with buttery flavors of red berry and chocolate. Tastes oaky, minty and forced, but overall it's not a bad wine given the price and subpar vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Labors from the start via soft, punchless aromas of generic red fruit. Feels a little flabby, with dry, basic flavors of red apple and cantaloupe. Turns pithy and slightly bitter on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty, dry and lightly spiced aromas frame stalky red fruit scents. Feels chunky and clampy, with rooty berry sweetness and rubbery bitterness on the back palate and finish. Good, but tough around the edges.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Gaseous smelling at first, then the nose transitions to rubbery plum and blackberry. Feels zesty and spunky, with tangy raspberry, pie cherry and tomato flavors. Feels racy and juicy, with a tomato-like flavor on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Citrusy on the nose, with tangerine and passion fruit aromas, with white grapefruit and less-defined citrus flavors. Grapefruit persists on the racy, tangy finish.",Spain,Albarín
"Prickly smelling, with pointed red-fruit aromas. Feels snappy and high in acid, with quick, zippy flavors of tangy red plum and red currant. Not too much flavor or feel on the quick, crisp finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Neutral, dusty and a bit damp-smelling, with a leanness to the palate feel as well as flavors of semitart melon and peach. Decent but fails to excite. Drink now.",Spain,Rosé
"Smells flat and sweet, with a plastic-like essence. Zesty in feel but angular, with tangy acids and candied red-fruit flavors along with a pinch of dry spice. Tastes oaky on the finish. Tempranillo with 20% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Rooty aromas come with a caustic side, something akin to Pine Sol or ammonia. Feels narrow and restricted, with limited berry flavors, juniper and other weird elements. An intense wine, but not in the right way.",Spain,Graciano
"Solid as a battleship, with lemony oak, marzipan and layer upon layer of black fruit aromas. Almost syrupy in its richness but not fully; it's chewy and creamy, with vital acids. The flavors are mega ripe and rich, emphasizing blackberry, black cherry preserves, fudge and fig paste. Yet at the same time it's an ethereal wine; the epitome of modern Rioja. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"El Bosque is Eguren family top-shelf Rioja that's a knockout. It's dark as night, with dusty aromas of cola, cocoa, marzipan, blackberry and spice all rolled into a finessed whole. Feels tight as a drum but balanced, with monstrous flavors of boysenberry, cassis, peppercorn, baking spices and chocolate. Young and raring to go; hold until 2013 then drink through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This single-vineyard Rioja always impresses through its impeccable balance, depth of aromas and richness. Aromas of jammy blackberry come with blueberry, orange peel, graham cracker and graphite. It's tight and mildly tannic, with pure boysenberry, cassis, roasted plum, charred spice and toast flavors. Coconut, vanilla and coffee flavors are on the front side of the finish. A beautiful wine that will be best from 2013–2016.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A rank well above most PX sweeties, with lush but fresh aromas of raisin and spice that are distinctly not syrupy or heavy. Feels thick, but there's enough acidity to cut through the wine's weight. Flavors of caramel and chocolate are ideal, and the finish is smooth, not heavy, and has bounce in its step. A beautiful PX any way you cut it.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Perfectly sweet, unctuous and rich, with lush coffee and cocoa aromas that indicate that complexity is coming. That promise is rewarded on the palate, which hits fifth gear in seconds flat. Flavorwise, it's complex and balanced, with good acidity forcing up orange and honey flavors in addition to raisin and brown sugar. A Wow wine where there finish lasts for minutes on end.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Dense up front, with earthy notes to go with aromas of cola, ripe berry, coconut, almond candy and toast. Features a well-oaked personality and full flavors of ripe black plum, blackberry, fine herbs and integrated spice. Long and lasting on the finish, like a good cigar. Mature, but with lots of life left; drink now through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Smooth and inviting from the start, with floral aromas, popping cherry and ripe plum on the bouquet. Feels fresh and forward, with black cherry, cola, baked plum and spice flavors. Gets it right all the way through, with smoothness and chocolaty oak on the finish. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Layered, stout and pure smelling, with aromas of cola, chocolate and modern, ripe berry fruit that roll out the welcome mat. Feels full and tannic, with toasty black fruit flavors accented by espresso and bitter chocolate. Finishes dark, with coffee and licorice flavors. Best from late 2012 through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Even in marginal vintages like 2008, Atauta manages to shine above the rest. This delivers a gorgeous mix of blackberry blended with complex notes of fine herbs, vanilla and chocolate. It's alert in the mouth, with strong but manageable tannins and full flavors of berry, cherry and vanilla. Short but precise on the finish; drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Ripe and leaning to the dark fruit side, with spicy blackberry aromas. Feels round and complete as it unfolds, and not at all edgy. Flavors of plum, cocoa and spice come with toasty oak, and the finish is bright and snappy. Will age for another decade without much trouble, but it's more than drinkable now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mellow on the nose, with red fruit aromas, freshness, hints of tobacco and marzipan. Feels flush in the mouth and lifted by fine acids, while it tastes of dried berry and plum, with dark spice accents. Shows a touch of espresso bitterness on a long finish. A keeper to drink now through 2017.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Bold and gold, with penetrating aromas of orange, dried apricots, sweat and honey comb. The feel is rich and layered, with just enough acidity to lend volume to the apricot, dried peach and honey flavors this late-harvest Chardonnay is pushing. Thick and a bit unctuous on the finish; drink now.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Tight and edgy but ultimately oaky and generous on the nose, with earth, vanilla, dried cheese and blackberry notes. Feels cushioned and complete, with depth of feel and flavor; tastes of deep berry, mild herbs and finally a toasty wave of coffee and chocolate takes over. Impressive for a 2008; drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ultraconcentrated and almost heavy on the nose, but not fully syrupy or leaden. Has a heavy disposition in the mouth, with brown sugar, caramel and other usual suspects making up the flavor profile. Creamy and chunky on the finish. Excellent dessert wine for the price.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Thick and potent on the nose, with aromas of prune, cola and fig. Feels dense and syrupy, with dulce de leche, cocoa and integrated citrus flavors. An unbridled winner with richness, length and raw value; how many $15 wines rank this high? Not many.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Ripe, dense and powerful, with on onslaught of raisin, spice, pepper and leather on the nose. The palate is direct and pure, with clean flavors of berry, spice and chocolate leading to a long, layered finish. Beautiful wine; one of the best I've had from this region. 70% Monastrell with 20% Cabernet and 10% Syrah.",Spain,Red Blend
"Arguably the best Ysios reserva to date; it shows a full, lightly baked bouquet with berry aromas, spice, barrel char and herbs. Feels fresh and lush, with balance and tasty flavors of black fruit, fig, tobacco and chocolaty oak. It's a touch oaky and warm on the finish, but elegant and very well made. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Tan in color and elegant beyond what's normal, this high-end fino shows full, complex aromas of honey, citrus, rancio, dried gouda cheese and nuttiness. It feels both easy and fresh, with dry, intense flavors of citrus and almond. Long and smooth on the finish, with zero burn or bite.",Spain,Sherry
"Light brown and slightly translucent in color. Aromas lean toward raisin and prune, but there's orange zest and molasses on the bouquet as well. Bores straight ahead on the palate, with sweet flavors of burnt brown sugar, caramel and prune. Satisfying and balanced even if it's not overly complex.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"A deep, cool, mellow style of PX with requisite raisin and prune aromas along with molasses and a touch of heat. Feels unctuous and almost cloying, with concentrated caramel and raisin flavors. Very long and supersweet, with excellent power and commendable balance.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Lower in price than Cenit's Old Vines, but to me this is a better, more open wine with bacon, spice and bold black-fruit aromas. The palate is full but retains finesse as well as big tannins; flavors of black fruits come with chocolate, coffee and spice. Full-force stuff but still fairly refined. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark, condensed and inky, with big, muscular aromas of charcoal, cassis liqueur, blackberry and tar. The palate is just lush enough despite being staunch and tannic, and the flavors of black fruit and cassis are luscious and sweet, with a bit of lemony oak adding zest. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Golden brown in color, with smooth, almondy aromas along with apricot, cinnamon and toffee. The palate is full, round, smooth and satisfying, with a fine blend of weight, acidity and prime Sherry flavors. Overall this is a rich, heady style of dry Amontillado that finishes long and secure.",Spain,Sherry
"Mature, classy and different than most, with earth, tobacco, warm fruit, baked notes and subtlety to the bouquet. The palate is whole, welcoming and full of baked plum, spice, molasses and leathery, and then it finish long and complex, but a little sweet and rooty. A winner from Mallorca for those seeking something different. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Textbook Rioja reserva from a legendary label and a top vintage. Smells lightly baked and smooth, with leather, tobacco, raspberry and spice. Feels zesty, clean and pure, with reedy berry, tobacco and leathery baked plum flavors. Savory and smooth on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Rooty, leathery and spicy aromas accent dry baked-berry notes. The feel is smooth and natural, with texture and acidity supporting toasty, leathery, spicy berry and plum flavors. Mildly baked tasting on the finish, with cinnamon and pepper accents. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend

The palate is saturated but not heavy or chewy, with body and balance that highlights plum, berry, cherry and toasty oak and spice flavors. Shows freshness, health, quality and finesse. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice and bronze, with nutty, potent aromas that are forward and chiseled. Lively, clipped and zesty in the mouth, with nutty pecan, toasted almonds, lemon zest and length. A powerful Sherry that represents the Palo Cortado category with aplomb.",Spain,Sherry
"Stocky, dark and pure, with inky aromas of shoe polish, black fruits and charcoal. The palate is brawny and tannic, with saturated blackberry, espresso and bitter chocolate flavors. It's rowdy but also attractive and full of everything good including chocolate, spice and pepper on the finish. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Warm and smooth, with aromas of fresh dill, spiced cherries, mulled earth and more. The palate has a full, stacked feel with well-oaked flavors of vanilla, toffee and earthy berries. Finishes chewy, with complexity and light flavors of caramel and tobacco. Ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"Super smooth and complete on the nose, with black fruit, toasty oak and earth notes rolled into a nice whole. It's lush, plump and balanced, with full blackberry, raisin, chocolate and spice flavors resting in front of a mellow, spicy finish. A pretty, balanced blend of 75% Tempranillo and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon that shows Jumilla at its best.",Spain,Red Blend
"Elegant and classically built on the nose, with lemony oak, coconut, cola and dried cherry aromas. Feels a bit high in acidity, with raspberry, dry spice and tobacco flavors. Juicy and long on the finish, and with this type of acidity it'll last another decade, no sweat. Drink now through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Classic in its aromas, earthiness, zesty acidity and dried fruit character. The mouthfeel is bright, juicy and fresh, with earthy berry flavors, a mild baked element, chocolate notes and leather. Expands on the finish, and overall this is a textbook wine that's honest and sings of what Rioja represents.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts out smelling charred and heavy, but with time the bouquet softens and shows aromas of smoky berry and fresh brewed coffee. Feels grippy and resiny, but healthy, with herb-infused flavors of blackberry, spice, clove and tobacco. Long, winding and oaky on the finish. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Traditional in style and approachable, with aromas of brick dust, dried berry, tobacco and leather. Feels flush and just concentrated enough, while the flavors of baked berry, sweet plum and earth work well together. Finishes round and solid. A very good value.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean, minerally, slightly green in aromatics and oh so approachable and nice. For an under-$15 white, this Godello from Monterrei excels with layered flavors of apple, minerals and natural spice. The finish is long and hints at fresh herbs like thyme and tarragon. Potentially superb with garlic shrimp or calamari over fresh greens.",Spain,Godello
"Rooty, warm and leathery at first, and then it really rounds into form. This Garnacha-led multigrape blend is a pretty, earthy, stylish wine that's at peak maturity. It brings baked, rich black cherry, cola and toffee flavors and then a finish of coffee and toast. A bit syrupy but still excellent and ready now.",Spain,Red Blend
"White pear, melon and almond skin aromas are good and correct, while the peachy palate has roundness and interesting flavors of orange, lime and nectarine. Crisp, precise and well-glued together, with harmony throughout. A textbook food-friendly white that's more interesting than other Rías Baixas wines due to the addition of Loureira and Caiño Blanco to traditional Albariño.",Spain,White Blend
"Roasted and baked on first blush, but then the wine's complexity and use of unusual Mallorcan grape varieties take over. Along the way there's flavors and aromas of prune, earth, leather, spice and Mediterranean terroir. It's also bringing tobacco and leaf notes to the table. A fun, different wine that goes nicely with tapas. Drink now through 2011–12.",Spain,Red Blend
"Lightly herbal on the nose, but otherwise it's ripe and ready to go. The feel is slightly tannic and tight, but it's as fresh and healthy as can be. Flavors of raspberry, red plum and mild spice are comported and correct. Finishes long, with vigor. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Toasty smelling, with a hint of burnt banana chip, vanilla and roasted nuts. Round and mouthfilling for a fino, with toasty, nutty flavors followed by dry apricot and mild citrus. Focused on the finish, and lightly nutty as it fades away.",Spain,Sherry
"Opens in good form, with aromas of blackberry, rubber and earth. Feels a touch chunky and heavy, but it's easygoing and offers full flavors of berry fruits, rubber, hoisin sauce and fig. Finishes smooth and round; drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pure and forward, with minerally aromas of citrus, grapefruit and wet stone. For basic Verdejo, this is head and shoulders above most; it bursts with fresh orange, grapefruit, green apple and peach, and the finish is pure and long. So tasty and super easy to like; a highly recommended go-to value white.",Spain,Verdejo
"Gets going with rooty, spicy aromas along with baked plum scents and fresh berry accents. Feels racy, tight and snappy, with dry spice, tomato, tobacco, pepper and raspberry comprising the flavors. Finishes focused, spicy and crisp; fresh and traditional in style.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A tough, sun-belted wine with concentration, big tannins and a ton of power and flavor. The nose is all bacon, balsamic notes, tobacco and roasted black fruit, while the ridged palate is dark and tastes of blackberry, molasses, coconut and brown sugar. Edgy, lemony and tannic on the finish. Drink now with beef; can be held for another 3–5 years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Baked, earthy and leathery, just like all the AN wines. But there's also a smooth intersection of the old and new worlds here; it's one part rooty, oaky and rich but also dry, leathery and indigenous to the Balearics (the base grape is Callet). Finishes a little sweet and warm, and thus it's begging to be drunk now.",Spain,Red Blend
"A more traditional type of crianza with vanilla, spice, dry berry fruit and a quiet, subtle approach. The mouthfeel is Old World with it's clean, dusty weight and proper acid-tannin balance, and the flavors of spice, cherry, dried currant and earth don't overstep their place. Very nice wine for under $20.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice, clean and vibrant, with a welcoming set of peach, apricot and citrusy aromas. The wine is 100% correct and fresh, with clarity and flavors of apple, peach and green grapes. Shows just enough body, acid and pith on the finish, but drink now before it starts to fade.",Spain,Albariño
"Soft and raisiny on the bouquet, with leather, earth, prune and baked qualities. Feels meaty and solid in the mouth, with drawing tannins along with herbal, moderately intense blackberry flavors. Darkens up on the finish, where cocoa, prune and coffee flavors are dominant. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Interesting and very much showing Navarran qualities, including aromas of black olive, herbs and mossy fruit. The palate has good structure, balance and feel, and thus there's a nice platform for dry black cherry, cassis and mocha flavors. As an '05 it's evolved, still fresh enough, and ready to go.",Spain,Red Blend
"Crisp, clean and minerally on the nose, with apple and green-fruit aromas. It has a round, smooth feel and flavors of peach, apple and citrus that will enliven the palate and aid almost any seafood, vegetable or salad. A natural wine with just enough powdery sweetness to raise a smile.",Spain,Albariño
"Very solid and sturdy, with aromas of apple, lemon-lime, soda cracker and mineral. The palate is fuller and more flavorful than your average cava, with candied apple, papaya, lime and lemon flavors. Dry, pithy and hinting at complexity on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A different breed of blended wine, with earthy aromas of dried cheese, leather, dill and vanilla. The palate is tight and mildly tannic, with sweet cola, roasted berry and earthy tobacco flavors. Not your normal bulky, dark wine; it's complex and based on 85% Garnacha and Carignan.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pure and intense up front, with dry, nutty core aromas and not too much blatant oxidation. Fresh and kicking in the mouth, but still fairly smooth, with nutty, toasty flavors and a hint of baked apple. Nutty, creamy and not too acidic or scouring on the finish.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Ripe, with a slightly baked persona turns more jammy with airing. Despite aromatic richness, the wine is a bit jagged and jabby in the mouth, with roasted berry, leather and acid-based sharpness. Still, it's a very good modern Rioja from a not-so-great vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fairly rubbery and smoky on the nose, with hickory aromas vying with blueberry and plum notes. Feels good and full, with sweet berry flavors and plenty of oak. In fact, this is a woody, modern style of Mencía that's lengthy and round.",Spain,Mencía
"Crisp, nutty and very much as you'd expect a Manzanilla Sherry to be, but with a bit more color, body and nuttiness. Feels nice in the mouth, with modest, controlled flavors of toasted almond, baked apple, green olive and brine. Turns oily and slightly bitter on the finish.",Spain,Sherry
"Foresty aromas blend with cola, nutmeg and spicy berry scents. The palate is a touch clacky and narrow, with zesty acidity and flavors of lemon, mushroom and dried raspberry. Turns sharper and more angular on the finish, but overall it's still a very nice taste of traditional Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Starts out rustic and leathery, with hints of smoke, leafiness and earth along with baked berry and spice. This four-grape wine has good density and mouthfeel that frames leather, earth and slightly baked berry fruit flavors. Finishes chocolaty and sweet, with just enough acidity to maintain balance.",Spain,Red Blend
"A delicious wine and very much the model for value in Spanish Garnacha. That this has 25% Tempranillo only seems to make it better; the nose is sweet but full and plummy. The palate is pure, flavorful and sweet, with baked cherry, earthiness and a hint of chocolate. A wine to buy in quantity, i.e. by the case.",Spain,Red Blend
"Sappy green apple, grapefruit and citrus aromas are welcoming and pure, while the palate is soft-edged, citrusy and full or tangerine and melon flavors. A good, honest, clean Verdejo that has sure-fire mass appeal. More solid than special, which is what you should want from this kind of wine.",Spain,Verdejo
"Nutty and toasty, with toffee and butter pecan aromas. The palate is wet, light, alert and snappy, but also angular and citrusy. The acidity here is key; it pushes dried apricot and tangy flavors toward a nutty finish, and overall the wine delivers what a good, higher-end palo cortado should.",Spain,Palomino
"Fragrant, clean and tropical, with slate-driven minerality. The palate is just fleshy enough but mostly it's tight and crisp, with flavors of green apple, fresh green herbs and a drip of honey. Holds it together from front to back; just right for salads and seafood-based tapas.",Spain,Godello
"Full and fruity, but with an aromatic pinch of latex and rubber that subsides with airing. Feels healthy on the palate, with good grip and weight to bolster raspberry, plum, cola and spice flavors. In golfing terms, it splits the fairway; it's perfectly good and should generate no complaints.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Floral fruit aromas suggest blueberry, but overall this vintage lacks the power and depth that Termes and its big brothers are known for. Airing sets up sweet, easygoing berry flavors and full tannins, but in the middle it's less whole than it has been in other years. A juicy, well-made wine that should not be judged as weak just because 2007 was a marginal vintage. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Opens with cherry aromas and brightness, then the palate fans out and fattens up with juicy plum and cherry flavors along with just a touch of medicinality. Toasty, warm and tasty, with a thoroughness not usually found in $8 wines. Garnacha at 70% with 30% Syrah.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"Very smooth with youthful, juicy, fragrant berry aromas along with a bouncy palate full of sweet cherry and cassis flavors. Clean, snappy, alert and healthy. More simple and straightforward than complex, but worth the money and then some.",Spain,Garnacha
"Yellow in color, with a waxy nose that's baked, rich, a bit stalky but also honeyed. The palate is round, hefty and thick, with full melon and peach flavors in front of a plump, woody finish. Good as you're likely to find among Spanish Chardonnay.",Spain,Chardonnay
"A totally pleasant wine, with earthy berry and toast aromas that lead to a full, cushioned, properly tannic palate. Shows lemony oak, citrusy notes, tomato, herbs, plum and raspberry flavors. Finishes dry, with tobacco as a lingering flavor. A very nice, dry style of Ribera reserva.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Floral and not overpowering in style, with good red-fruit aromas. Feels smooth and silky, not edgy, with tasty berry flavors touched up by a dollop of oak and chocolate. A fresh, easy wine to sip by the glass or with casual tapas.",Spain,Mencía
"An opening of apricot and peach aromas is proper, while the palate delivers a jolt of zest and acidity to more pineapple, lime and punchy green-apple flavors. Tangy later on, with more than a drop of lemon and lime to the finish. Also slightly pithy and bitter, which is natural for Godello.",Spain,Godello
"Minerality and crispness define the bouquet, which brings green apple and citrus aromas. There's punch and spritz on the palate as well as sweet citrus and juicy lime flavors that break up a little as they fan out. Not sure if there's residual sugar, but the wine tastes a bit sweet.",Spain,Albariño
"Shy at first, with standard raspberry aromas, earth and buttery notes along with cherry and raspberry flavors. Becomes fuller and more satisfying with time, and once it's fully open you have a solid, satisfying Rioja with true flavors and good overall balance.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with a load of sweet, candied black-fruit aromas but this wine excels on the nose because it's composed and precise for being so young and simple in scope. Velvety, rich black-cherry flavors run the show, and the finish brings length and an herbal shading. Very nice for a wine from Toro at this price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Comes out of the chute with some aggression, but that's settled by quality apple and grassy aromas. The palate is jumpy and lively, with pleasant, slightly sweet apple and peach flavors. Shows good refinement, ample layering of flavors and a spot of minerality. As a whole, this is good cava.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice. And the flavors are friendly and suggest black fruits and smoke. A little more oaky and charred than some, but a nice crianza nonetheless.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty lemon and cidery aromas are solid and draw you in. The palate has a fresh, clean feel and lively, tangy flavors of citrus, green fruits and green herbs. Zesty, a bit lemony, and nice on the finish. Not a complicated bubbly by any means.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dark and fully oaked Rioja with vanilla, mocha, char and black-fruit aromas. The body is good while the acidity is a bit high, and thus the flavors lean toward tart black cherry and zesty wild blackberry all with a robust amount of toast, spice and charred darkness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Solid on the nose, with pure berry aromas matched by oak-related vanilla. Fresh and medium in weight, with juicy acidity and mild tannins. Tastes of dried red fruits, blackberry, vanilla and tobacco. Fairly long and slightly elegant on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Brickish in color, with mature aromas of cedar, pine, tobacco, olive and dried fruits. There's still some racy acidity that's keeping the rooty flavors of tobacco, dried berry, coffee and spice moving forward. Finishes dry and a little bit classic; drink now for an affordable taste of Navarra.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins. There's nothing not to like about this Albariño, which is pure, pithy on the finish, and more than solid in a pedestrian, familiar sort of way.",Spain,Albariño
"Smooth on the nose, with a pinch of rubber, earth, smoked beef and plum/prune. The palate offers structure, solid acidity, zestiness and bright flavors of cherry and raspberry. Finishes crisp and tight, with lingering vanilla. A nice wine for tapas and other meat-based dishes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"While I prefer the 2009 for its clarity and freshness, this '08 is no slouching tiger. The nose delivers still-fresh apple and mineral aromas, while the flavor profile leans toward gooseberry, lemon and green melon. Shows some pithy bitterness on the finish, so drink right away or seek out the '09.",Spain,Godello
"Mineral, lime and crisp apple aromas give it a precise, pure nose. And that same character exists on the palate and finish, where white peach, green banana and melon flavors are full and forward. Shows good concentration and quality for a large-production bubbly at this price.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Smells clean as a mountain stream, with apple, peach and mellow citric aromas. Shows medium intensity and controlled citrusy acids along with grapefruit, pineapple and passion fruit flavors that come largely from the 20% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend; the rest is 70% Chardonnay and 10% the local Picapoll grape. Interesting, and a very good Catalonian white wine to match with seafood.",Spain,White Blend
"Sweet, jammy and a touch raisiny on the bouquet, with a roasted quality summing things up. Feels more acidic than expected, with zest and juiciness pushing flavors of blackberry mixed with tobacco and vanilla. Finishes herbal and oaky, but ripe and ready.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with waxy, sweet aromas of yellow apples and honey. Feels good, round and balanced, with Golden Delicious apple flavors sweetened by honey drippings and melon. Stays sweet but maintains a fruit component on the finish even as the texture and intensity dissipate. Good for varietal Xarel-lo.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance. Powerful acidity pushes it in the right direction, and the finish of lychee, passion fruit and nectarine is lasting. Very nice wine but relatively high in price.",Spain,Albariño
"Stylistically, this is at odds with what I feel Albariño should be. That said, it's a well-executed and well-made barrel-fermented white with full-force toast and popcorn aromas followed by a resiny, vanilla-fueled flavor profile that folds in apple, banana and creamy frosting. Still vital and healthy after three years in bottle.",Spain,Albariño
"For Navarran Merlot-Cab, Inurrieta Norte is always a winner. This vintage has good darkness along with smooth aromas of black fruit, earth, rubber and spice. It's a bit acidic and shrill as a tasting wine but will do fine at the table. The mouth is spunky and shows slightly herbal raspberry and plum flavors. Finishes light and easy.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"For a rosado cava, this offers nice fruit, balance and complexity. The nose is pure cherry and raspberry, but in subdued doses. Meanwhile, it's zesty, foamy and fresh in the mouth, with nectarine, plum, strawberry and prickle. Perfectly nice for everyday quaffing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of cherry and leather come with burnt earth and smoke, but overall the nose is inviting. The palate is solid in feel, with good weight and drive that supports a smoky flavor profile of red berries and controlled bitterness. Finishes toasty, with a lick of bitter chocolate.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A perfectly solid Garnacha with pepper, bright red fruit and a touch of country style to the bouquet despite its pedestrian price. The palate is bright and tastes of plum and red berry, while the feel is good and the finish fruity and lively. What inexpensive red wine should be.",Spain,Garnacha
"Tight on the nose but also a bit oxidized and yeasty smelling. Feels more tangy and juicy than Alvear's Fino en Rama, with forward acidity, bite and cut. Flavorwise, there's a heavy dose of nuts, apricot and citrus followed by a zesty finish.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Clear and focused, with raspberry and edgy spice aromas to the nose. The palate doesn't bring a whole bunch of meat or heft, but it is clean, racy and food-friendly. Flavors of red berries and pepper are normal and expected, while the finish is dry and lean.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lime, citrus and other pungent aromas get it off to a good start, while the palate is wet and fresh, with clean, familiar grapefruit, lime and nectarine flavors. Lighter and less concentrated than Naia, but still a very good Verdejo for the price.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dry and subtle on the nose, with cherry and plum fruit scents mixed with balsam wood. The palate is tight, simple and offers a bit of creaminess to go with raspberry and oak-based vanilla and mocha. Light on the finish and fresh, with a medium body.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Timid but clean as a whistle on the nose, with apple and vanilla aromas along with a sprinkling of talcum powder. The palate is lively and fresh, with flavors of pineapple, lemon and other tropical hints. Entirely pedestrian as cava goes, but 100% clean and refreshing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dry and peppery to start, with muted berry fruit aromas along with wood shavings. The palate is snappy, clean and juicy, with raspberry, vanilla and tobacco-like flavors. More basic than special, with a steady, light-framed finish. More than functional; likely good with food.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Neutral aromas suggest peach, apple and minerality. Solid, compact and healthy on the palate, with peach and white pepper flavors. Good on the finish but starting to show some maturity; at peak level now so drink immediately or wait for the 2011.",Spain,Albariño
"Pinched smelling at first, with a note of turpentine. Airing eliminates that burn, leaving standard nut and vanilla aromas. Feels good and lively, with refreshing acidity and nutty, dry flavors of white fruits including peach and apricot. Finishes long and fresh.",Spain,Palomino
"Starts out somewhat fiery, with a dose of aromatic horseradish. After airing out, this varietal Tempranillo is fresh, juicy and crisp on the tongue, with flavors of baking spices, tomato, roasted plum and earth. Feels juicy on the finish, maybe a bit lean, and overall it's cut from the classic cloth.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This vintage rosado is as good as always, but a bit lower on the quality ladder than previous years. The color is light pink and soft on the eye, while the nose suggests brick dust and orange peel. Smooth and easygoing, with sweet, generic flavors of orange and berry.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Normally this producer's high-end Sherries are outstanding, but this Amontillado is aggressive and hard, with a clod-like character that starts with molasses on the nose and then turns toward sharpness and bitterness on the palate. Try as I might, this one strikes me as good but loud, hard, forceful and lacking the suavity that great Sherries possess.",Spain,Sherry
"This is your quintessential simple quaff among brut cavas. It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors. It's slightly sweet and tropical, but still it holds onto its crisp qualities and dryness. No complaints for the money.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Slightly low on kick and bubbles for a blanc de blancs, but the wine's mix of green herb, apple, green banana and melon flavors is good and offers the proper set up to a finish that's citrusy as can be and only slightly pithy. Seems a touch flat or it might have rated even higher.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dusty, slightly candied aromas are briary and pretty good, and overall it's giving freshness, pop and red-fruit flavors touched up by dill, nutmeg and vanilla. Clean and lively on the finish, and more than competent as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts out with roasted, stewy, beefy aromas and not much brightness. The palate is measured and healthy, with dry raspberry, currant and medicinal plum flavors. It shows oak, earth, leather, acidity and some burn. In a nutshell, it's a good, standard, respectable Rioja that will complement almost any food.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A heavy, slightly strained wine that has a lot in tow. The nose is smoky, rubbery like an inner tube, and a bit herbal. In the mouth, it's a wide load with sweet, sugary, baked flavors of blackberry, prune, fig and chocolate. Very much on the ripe side, with a full tannic bite.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Initially it's rugged, but airing reveals black-cherry aromas and dry spice. The palate is crisp and a little sheer by itself, but the call here is that with food it'll be a winner. Flavors of red fruits are dry and collected, while the finish blends in coffee, spice and a touch of herbal Navarran panache.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Good on the nose, with solid raspberry and nectarine aromas. The palate is spunky and alert, with juicy red-cherry, rhubarb and integrated spice flavors. It's mostly a clean, basic, easy-to-drink bubbly, but it's persistent, harmonious and commendable. Pinot Noir with Trepat is the grape mix.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of apple cider and mild spice get it going in a good direction, and this colorfully packaged cava does pretty well in the mouth, where the texture is on the soft side and the flavors of apple and orange run a bit sweet. Not complex but good, fluffy and yeasty.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Clean, fresh and full of bright cherry and strawberry aromas. Offers the right size and balance, with red plum and red berry flavors touched up by light oak. Mildy toasty and textured on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A touch raisiny and sweet from nose to tail, but what's in between is convincing for Jumilla. Aromas of licorice and herbs are sweet but nice, while the flavors or raisin and blackberry are chunky, with a basic finish that's a little flat but definitely ripe. A blend of Monastrell, Cabernet, Tempranillo and Merlot that's ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"For Spanish Chardonnay, this is perfectly good and clean. The nose brings your basic set of white-fruit, mineral and fresh herb flavors, while the palate is lively despite some dry, resiny oak flavor. Even with banana, vanilla and creamy flavors, the wine is decidedly not cloying.",Spain,Chardonnay
"This winery is known for red Mencía, but this small-lot Godello is perfectly nice and drinkable. It has a neutral nose and a fresh palate of green melon, nectarine and apple flavors. The finish is clipped and a touch bitter, but there's no denying its tangy, forward approach. Only 250 cases made.",Spain,Godello
"Dusty earth and dry spice aromas blend with some char, vanilla and berry/cherry on the nose. The palate shows average density and depth, with lighter flavors of strawberry, raspberry, herbs, tobacco and vanilla. Finishes dry and peppery, with some toast.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean and minerally, with stony aromas along with banana and pineapple. The palate is tight, clean and balanced, with flavors of green banana, papaya and apple. Finishes pithy and with a touch of fresh-grated white pepper. A good but common type of unoaked Chardonnay.",Spain,Chardonnay
"A clean, fresh, appealing sort of Tempranillo with cola, earth, black cherry and berry aromas followed by a bright, forward, spicy cherry palate. Honest, snappy, healthy and juicy; nice and solid for La Mancha.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Simple, nice and not trying too hard; this basic brut is graced with nice apple and citrus aromas. The palate is wet, juicy and classic, with crisp apple, green herb and melon flavors. Round, clean and just crisp enough.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish. For under $15 this is good, casual Albariño that won't steer you wrong.",Spain,Albariño
"Opens with earth, lemon peel and lightly baked plum aromas. Feels easy and plump, with a good mouthfeel and proper acidity. Shows creamy oak flavors along with rooty berry, toast and milk chocolate. Turns more spicy and dusty on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"After an aromatic opening that includes wet leather, rubber and brine, this wine finds its stride, and while it's firmly tannic, the flavors of dark fruits, tomato, herbs, tobacco and cured meats do the trick. It gets better the longer it sits; drink now but give it as much air as possible.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Fresh and full of lime on the nose, and overall this is simple, smooth and gives you little reason to worry or fuss. The palate is smooth, creamy and a little low on acids, thus the lemon-lime and melon flavors have a fullness that's sweet and good.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Sweet and a little grassy on the nose, with lemon-lime aromas. The palate has a solid, regular, friendly feel along with sweet flavors of white nectarine, apple juice and tarragon. Perfectly quaffable, dry in feel despite being semisweet, and balanced. For the price, what's not to like? Imported",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dark in color, with concentrated, jammy aromas of wild berry and plum. Offers a big body given that it's a $7 La Mancha varietal, with concentration, solid structure and full, mildly baked flavors of black fruits and baked fig. Short but stout on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light and a little scratchy on the bouquet, with leathery notes. Feels fresh and kind of light in weight, with basic but clean red-fruit flavors and a dash of peppery spice. Flows easily on the finish, with a bit of fire and heat.",Spain,Mencía
"Starts out odd and exotic, with blueberry and Middle Eastern spice aromas. Feels condensed and jammy, with full flavors of herbs, boysenberry and plum. Shows freshness along with simplicity, with finishing herbal notes of sage and tarragon. Contains 10% each Merlot and Cabernet.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A neutral cava with white candy and mango on the nose. The palate is both foamy and scouring, with soda cracker, apple and citrus pith creating the flavor profile and finish. Shows basic flavors, normal mouthfeel and scouring acidity.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Opens somewhat clipped and choppy, with citrusy aromas mixed with red fruits. The palate is healthy, lean and acidic, with bright plum and berry flavors softened by some creamy vanilla. A solid wine with punch, acidity and a good finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lucid and basically colorless, with flowery, lychee-like aromas that suggest Malvasia or Moscatel. But it's only Viura and Chardonnay, and it tastes fresh, floral and nice, with lime and lychee. About as easy as they come.",Spain,White Blend
"A bit unusual and confusing, but that's because it hails from the Rioja region. The nose is herbal and mustardy, with green aromas leading to a cidery palate of apples and spice. There's also a bit of lemon and creaminess to this cava. Hard to understand but not without its merits.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Seems as though this medium-sweet Viura-Malvasia blend has gotten better in recent years as the winery has dialed down the sweetness and weight. Lately, this vintage included, Satinela has been fresh, cleanly made and easygoing, with sweet pear and peach flavors and not too much weight or residual sugar. Captures the essence of medium sweet.",Spain,White Blend
"Solid on the opening, with red fruit aromas and a mild stalkiness. Feels healthy and medium in weight, with mild oak, fresh plum and berry, and a touch of cocoa for flavors. Dry and crisp on the finish, with leftover oak flavor and good balance.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The quality of the 2009 vintage is reflected in this value-priced Toro that's full and medicinal but also balanced and rewarding. Flavors of medicinal red-berry fruit are mixed with thicker, chocolaty notes, while the finish is bold, grabby and solid. A blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Clean and approachable, with lemon-lime aromas leading to an easy, mildly crisp palate with lemon, lime and honeydew flavors. Sweet in accordance with standard extra dry guidelines, and also good for apéritifs and sparkling cocktails.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Apple, spearmint, mixed greens and citrus carry the bouquet to a firm palate with dry papaya, lemon and herb flavors. Finishes with apple, lemon and bitterness. Very basic and quaffable, but nothing extraordinary.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Opaque in color, with blackberry and licorice aromas but also a distinct streak of brambly herbs and green. Later on, pine needle and tartness enter the fray. This is a commendable modern Rioja but it does have a few issues, namely a green herbal component.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sort of generic and oily on the nose, with white-fruit aromas that don't fully register. The palate is both spongy and spritzy, with dry, soft flavors of melon and papaya. More fluffy and lush than zesty and precise.",Spain,Verdejo
"Waxy on the nose, with buttercup, creamy yellow-fruit scents and white flowers. The palate is wet, racy and a touch like soda, with sweet, candied flavors of peach and melon. Plods along with good enough acidity to support the wine's core sweetness and candied qualities.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Starts with distinct, hard aromas of mustard, horseradish and jerky. In the mouth, it's full, bullish and tannic, with flavors of bacon, wood resin, smoke and stewed blackberry. Very smoky and dark, with hard tannins, and just not as good as past vintages.",Spain,Merlot
"Unusual in that this cava hails from the Ribera del Duero region, where red wines are 99.9% of the show. For a no-dosage nature, it's properly crisp and dry, almost like a liquid version of a soda cracker. There are some holes in the fabric but overall it's citrusy, tight and only mildly bitter on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Bold, forward and extracted red wine, with raspberry, earth, compost and a light leafiness to the nose. Tannic and tight, with plum and heavy, ripe berry flavors. Toasty and dark on the finish too, with power and freshness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Heavy, dark, candied and jammy, with a hint of licorice to the nose. The palate is chunky and concentrated, with meaty berry flavors and a dose of chocolate. Short on the finish, yet fruity if a bit flat.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"The tough conditions of the 2008 vintage are reflected in this scratchy wine. Plum is the key fruit aroma, and that's followed by a tight, firm body with toasty oak, black fruit flavors, herbal notes and peppery spice. Quick and a touch hot on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Smells full but reduced, with a foxy, candied leaning and aromas of vitamins and minerals. Feels big, bulky, grabby and thick, with baked blackberry and plum flavors. Full on the finish, with some heat.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Feels sturdy and properly acidic, with melon, papaya and apple flavors running alongside almondy bitterness. Simple and quick on the finish; 60% Xarel-lo and 40% Chardonnay.",Spain,White Blend
"Light on the nose, with dilute red-berry aromas and mild leathery, cheesy notes. The palate is kind of raw and lean, with tangy, crisp flavors of pie cherry and raspberry. Dry, peppery, snappy wine, with definitive crispness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pale and low on bead, but if you like a Moscato-style wine, this isn't bad at all. The palate is sweet, fleshy and smooth, with lychee and melon flavors. Lively but easy on the finish, with a final wave of lychee fruit and Malvasia-driven sweetness. Unusual but pretty good.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Floral, earthy, funky and barnyardy, with all the young exuberance that comes with joven/roble wines from RDD. Lots of color, power, tannins and extract along with young, sweet, chewy black-fruit flavors and tart acidity to the palate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hot earth, baked cherry and mild vanilla aromas come in front of a snappy, angular palate with tangy pie-cherry and red-plum flavors. Sheer and basic Rioja with high acidity, lean fruit, a cleansing finish and a light body.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells oily and a little burnt and acrid, with fleshy flavors of banana, melon and bitter pith. Has some verve but mostly it's an average wine with some bitterness and dry orange peel and pith. Decent but offers nothing beyond.",Spain,Verdejo
"Lively, candied and medicinal, with grassy aromas along with mild animal notes. The palate is young, grabby, forceful but solid, while the flavors are bright, bold, snappy and suggest red plum and black cherry. A basic young wine that's decent if you're not too discerning.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
Plum and blueberry aromas come with a hint of green herbs. Feels fresh and clamps down with good tannins in the mouth before unleashing dark plum along with toast and peppery spice flavors. Juicy on the finish.,Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy berry aromas come with rubbery notes, tobacco and bramble. The feel is scratchy but lively, with flavors of lean red fruits, dry oak and milk chocolate. Oaky on the finish, with some heat. Needs food to help it along.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit flat and jammy on the nose, and then it runs hot and heavy across the palate, where the flavors waver between citric and plum-cherry. There's a lot of fruit here, but also some burn and finally a dull hum to the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Earthy but sharp on the nose, with a foreboding sense of stem and sourness. The palate is indeed raw and acidic, with lean, slightly stemmy flavors of herbs, raspberry and plum. Not bad but carries a stemmy, less-than-pure personality.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A rubbery, minty, jammy wine, with a mildly candied, gummy feel and sweet, modest, lightly green flavors that suggest red fruits. The finish is decent but herbal and sweet.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bramble and red berry aromas are attractive and almost exotic. Feels a bit furry and scratchy, but tastes of blueberry with an herbal tinge. Finishes well, with a pinch of minty green flavor.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit tan and dull to the eye, with neutral aromas of apple cider and peach. The palate is wet, uncomplicated and simple, with basic apple flavors that some might consider to be bland. Solid on the finish, with papaya for flavor.",Spain,Viura-Chardonnay
"Starts out murky, gassy and challenged, and while it does emerge from that cloud it remains little more than bargain-priced, borderline Tempranillo from an obscure central Spain region. The palate shows generic, herbal black fruit and the finish is acceptable.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bright and shimmers with purple, while the nose is jumpy and candied, with a lot of sweetness and black fruit. Marginal to tough on the palate, with racy, hard tannins and a clacky feel to go with wild berry and mulchy flavors. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Generally speaking, most Amontillados are good at their worst, but for whatever reason this wine barely makes the grade. It lacks pop on the nose and seems dilute and drab. In the mouth, the flavors strike as sour and sharp, but also musty and weak. With so many fine Sherries available, this one seems like a laggard.",Spain,Palomino
"Strawberry and rhubarb aromas get it going, and frankly that's about as good as it gets. The mouthfeel is so-so. but the flavors are funky and mealy, with a weedy bitterness that doesn't serve the wine well. Lacks purity, focus and persistence. Made from Pinot Noir.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"A strange bird with herbaceous aromas that suggest sage or juniper baking in the summer sun. The palate is acidic and sharp, with green-tinged pie cherry and plum skin flavors. Gritty on the finish, with needling tannins and a final wave of that odd juniper character. 60% Monastell and 40% Petit Verdot.",Spain,Red Blend
Molten black-cherry aromas are followed by a tight but limited palate with hard tannins and hard-driving black-fruit flavors that turn quickly to pepper and ultimately a slight bitterness. Teases you at first then ducks out.,Spain,Mencía
"Shows dark fruit aromas and raisin on the nose, feels fresh, zesty and edgy, with a bright mix of cherry, berry and mild spice flavors. Feels pretty good and offers a reasonably solid and long finish for a $6 red.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with peachy, citric and saline aromas. Feels moderately fresh, but seems as though it's starting to mature as it's fleshy and pithy. Flavors of nectarine, orange and bitter pith are good but lack that ethereal quality that can make Albariño special. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Bouncy, jumpy, candied aromas come with scratchiness and minty green. Feels tangy and bordering on sheer, with zesty flavors of red berry fruits, citrus and herbs. Mild and not too deep on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Minerally on the bouquet, with apple and oceanic notes. Turns citric and acidic on the palate, with pineapple, orange and tangy flavors. Shows astringency on the finish, but at least it's juicy and driving.",Spain,Albariño
"Gold in color and short on bubbles, but heavy on sweetness and residual sugar. That said, it's an advertised semidry, so a certain level of cloy is expected. But this tips too far to the sweet side, leaving nothing but refined white sugar, banana and vanilla cream. Not my cup of tea.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Reddish in color and devoid of a visible bubble bead, this Garnacha-Monastrell cava is lacking in many ways. The nose is grassy and ashy, sort of like a spent cigar, and it's cheesy as well. In the mouth, it's fairly bland tasting, with generic, semitart flavors and a sharp finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A fairly unclean wine with leafy cough-drop aromas. The palate is weak and washed out, with stemmy red-fruit flavors. Spiced and leafy on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stemmy and raw smelling; similar in the mouth. The palate is narrow and sheer, while the flavors lean toward tart red cherry and rhubarb. Peppery and underwhelming.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Tight, citric and minerally up front, with less-than-expressive white fruit aromas. Extremely high in acidity, which is why this wine is still kicking. Tastes of tart white grapes and citrus, with zest galore on the finish. 220 cases produced.",Spain,Albariño
"Aromas of lemon blossom, apple and melon are friendly enough, and the palate has a clean, lifted feel. Flavors of pineapple, green apple and citrus are fresh but limited, while the finish is zesty but turns towards bitterness and almond skin.",Spain,Viura
"A bit scratchy up front, with some heat and rubber to the bouquet. Feels bold, grippy and alive, with lightly herbal flavors of roasted berry and leather. Herbal and blackened on the finish; ripe but basic in quality.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Scratchy red fruit aromas greet you along with leather and cheese scents. Feels juicy, light and mild, with plum, raspberry and freshness. Clean but lean, with zesty red fruit flavors and snappy acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jumpy and funky on the nose, with a lack of cohesion and a scent of wet dog. Feels grabby but lacks concentration; tastes herbal and mildly candied, with a scratchy and sweet tasting finish. Good but doesn't stand up to scrutiny.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Peach, melon and light oceanic aromas. Feels a bit flat, with slightly bitter flavors of almond skin and pithy citrus. Picks up steam on the finish courtesy of lasting acidity.",Spain,Albariño
"Smells decidedly burnt and stalky, with rubbery berry and black plum aromas. Shows grip on the palate, along with the same flavors hinted at on the nose: leather, burnt coffee, herbs and roasted berries. Feels pretty good, but the stalky, burnt core dominates.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Roasted, oaky and creamy smelling, with baked berry aromas. Conversely, it's rather edgy and citric in the mouth, with plum, citrus and tomato flvors accented by dill weed. Ends in herbal fashion, with crisp acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"On the plus side, the wine is exotic and different, with blueberry, herbal notes, juniper and roasted aromas. But in the mouth, it's lean to the point of being thin, with sharp acidity and tight red plum, pie cherry and herbal flavors. Short on the finish, with tang and scour.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Yellow in color, then fleshy and floral on the nose, with a hint of peach but also corn stalks. Feels full and clumsy, with sharp acidity and corny, cidery key flavors. Struggles to reach that next level.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Stalky and reedy smelling, with a touch of cherry and plum to the bouquet. There's not much to the palate other than mild citrus and red plum fruit, while the finish is little more than zesty. A fresh quaff.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Moscato aromas leap from the glass, taking the form of shampoo, lychee and jasmine. Feels light but choppy, with dilute lychee and green melon flavors. Not too sticky or cloying.",Spain,White Blend
"Baked and raisiny smelling, with kirsch. In a word, it's stewy. Ditto for the mouthfeel, which is chunky and heavy. Features thick black plum, herb and carob flavors and feels beefy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Grassy and green on the nose, and then lean, light and crisp in the mouth. Tastes brambly and herbal, with a thin finish. O.K. but not really rewarding.",Spain,Mencía
"Gritty cherry and plum aromas lead into a sheer, high-acid palate with citric burn and tart flavors of raspberry and plum skins. Finishes with limited flavor and leftover acid.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stalky smelling, with a minerally streak. Feels tangy and lean, with lemon, sour apple and white currant flavors. Short on the finish.",Spain,Viura
"Unusual aromas of creamed corn and exotic notes are too unfamiliar to register properly. It's thick but not entirely cloying, with powdered sugar and dried mango flavors. Weird stuff that probably won't find too many takers.",Spain,White Blend
"Powdery and oaky smelling, with not much fruit to get excited about. Feels soft and mushy, with banana, pear and resiny vanilla flavors. Feels resiny on the finish, too.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Strained from front to back. The nose smells pickled and funky, while the palate is boring in feel and tastes candied but also a lot like brine or caper juice. Sweet on the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Aromas of citrus, especially white grapefruit and lime, are spunky and sweaty like Sauvignon Blanc or Verdejo. A solid, fleshy palate is home to a mix of citric and tropical flavors, while the finish reverts back to grapefruit, with a monotone feel. This is Macabeo, Garnacha Blanca and Pedro Ximénez.",Spain,White Blend
"Cedar, tobacco and berry aromas are more general than specific. The palate is on the heavy side, with grabby tannins. Flavors of roasted berry fruits and cocoa finish dense, steady and with depth. While this is a bit heavy and ripe, it speaks of Rioja in a positive way; drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dry, leathery and earthy up front, this mature Mencía is all about grip and complexity. In the mouth, it's tight and tannic. Flavors of dry cherry and berry are layered and earthy, while hard tannins and additional earth notes steer a long, spicy finish. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Mencía
"Oaky aromas of almond, vanilla and peach settle on a palate with grip and acidity. Flavors of toasted almond, baked apple and briny apricot finish with forward acidity. This is a blend of Garnacha Blanca and Macabeo, but it's the white Garnacha that sticks out.",Spain,White Blend
"Aromas of brick dust, vitamins and baked fruits are gritty and require some navigating. This has a wiry, tight feel, yet in terms of flavors, it's ripe almost to the point of being raisiny. Heat, hard tannins and dried berry fruit flavors direct the finish. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Red Blend
"This blends intensity and nutty richness on the nose, backed up by a full, balanced palate. Flavors of dark caramel, toffee and chocolate end with the distinct flavor of café mocha and a lasting streak of caramel.",Spain,Sherry
"Direct berry fruit aromas are firm and tight. This feels ripped, honest and authentic, but ultimately approachable and uncomplicated. Black fruit, raw oak and licorice flavors precede a woody and weighty yet fresh and clean finish.",Spain,Mencía
"Fleshy blackberry and cassis aromas are jammy and grapy, with a note of iodine. This is very tannic and textured on the palate, with flavors of baked blackberry, stewed fig, burnt toast and bitter chocolate finishing hard and rubbery on a sizzling, stewed character.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Nectarine and apple aromas are good, while this feels plump and melony, but with spine. Briny flavors of gooseberry, apple and orange finish with a note of sea salt. Drink this fresh, minerally wine now.",Spain,Albariño
"This blend of Merseguera and Sauvignon Blanc is modest as a church mouse, with clean but dilute green-apple aromas. An easygoing, round palate offers orange and lime flavors in front of a pithy, citrusy finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Grassy, flat aromas are inoffensive but don't bring much to the table. This feels citrusy and foamy, with generic flavors of brown sugar and melon. Touches of milk chocolate and bitterness work the finish on this Pinot Noir-led rosé blend.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Stone-fruit aromas are the opening, and they're on the full, waxy, fleshy side. This weighs in with low acidity, and that results in broad flavors of papaya and green melon. A round finish, much like the nose, shows a fleshy component.",Spain,Verdejo
"Earthy, leathery aromas of plum and berry are a touch rustic. This feels rubbery and raw, but fresh. Dry, earthy plum flavors are limited, while the finish is short, with a tight, chalky feel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A blend of modest floral and mustard aromas makes for a quiet bouquet. Chalky and acidic in feel, this Malvasia-Viura blend tastes of tart peach, lemon and mustard. A stony feeling, borderline sour finish is angular and grabby.",Spain,Malvasia-Viura
"Initially this smells rugged and choppy, but calmer aromas of spice, red plum and cherry emerge with time. A fruity, approachable palate and straightforward cherry and plum flavors finish fairly long, with a touch of controlled bitterness.",Spain,Mencía
"Stony, minerally aromas of green apple and lemon are clean and focused. The palate follows that lead, showing minerally crispness along with firm but not cutting acidity. Apple, pear and peach flavors finish glassy and fresh.",Spain,Godello
"This blend of Mencía, the local Grand Noir and Merenzao opens with raisiny, spicy, slightly baked aromas that suggest nutmeg. The palate is drawing and hard, with earthy, slightly cooked flavors of cherry and kirsch that end with a dash of lemony oak.",Spain,Red Blend
"Earthy berry and leather aromas are fairly quiet. A more lively palate offers good weight and overall composition, while plum, raspberry and spice flavors finish with sweeter notes of raisin and baked berry.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smoky oak and hickory aromas are gaseous early on but come with ripe notes of raisin and plum. This Tempranillo-led blend feels round and grabby, but a touch hollow. Flavors of cherry, plum and chocolate are lightly oaked and finish with grabby tannins and modest earthy complexity.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of waffles and corn flakes suggest maturity and complexity. This feels open and wide, with depth to the palate. Direct flavors of lime and tangerine finish more citric and minerally than the nose, with a lasting sense of freshness.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Earthy aromas of brick dust blend with spiced cherry and tomato notes. A chewy, solid palate registers as correct, while this tastes of ripe, candied berry fruits and chocolate. A long, warm, slightly oaky finish sends this on its way.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of cured ham and funky, gaseous notes are heavy. Lime, mango and melon flavors persist on a chunky, slick feeling finish. This is good but oily and strange on the nose.",Spain,Muscat
"Ripe plum and berry aromas come with notes of wet earth and animal hide. A jammy, fleshy palate brings baked plum and berry flavors as well as notes of prune and raisin. A mellow, chunky finish tastes loamy and like spice cake.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Damp, rubbery aromas of berry fruits and cured meat amount to a weird ensemble. This is decidedly grabby on the palate, with salty, herbal plum flavors. A leafy, herbal, mildly green finish wraps up this kitchen-sink blend of Mencía and other grapes.",Spain,Red Blend
"Oaky, jammy aromas are wayward and slightly green. This blend of Tempranillo and Monastrell delivers heavy tannins on a widespread but unfocused palate. Oaky, drying berry flavors are more bitter than fruity, while the finish is choppy in feel and woody in taste.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromas of yeast, talcum powder and grass set up a palate of pithy citrus and pyranzinic flavors that are green and grassy. The finish on this Sauvignon Blanc, a grape you don't see too often in hot Jumilla, is green-flavored and snappy.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Rubbery plum and berry aromas and an alert, aggressive palate give this punch from the start. Black plum, spice and chocolate flavors end with heat and kick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rubbery, sweaty, muted aromas lead to a dilute, fizzy palate. Prickly green citrus and melon flavors end on the vegetal side.",Spain,Albariño
"At first, this sparkling Muscat smells like salad dressing and green strawberries. It's foamy but mostly healthy feeling on the palate, with sugary, grassy flavors of mango and pineapple. Overall, this has a strongly candied flavor profile.",Spain,Muscat
"Generic, yeasty white-fruit aromas are reasonably fresh and inoffensive but fall off with time in the glass. This tastes pithy and slightly bitter, with a grapefruit citrus character to the front palate and finish.",Spain,Viura
"Black cherry, plum and currant aromas are young, bouncy and fresh as a whole. That pretty much describes the palate on this Garnacha-led blend: It's lively, rubbery, tannic and fresh. Blackberry, plum and black currant flavors finish tannic and grabby. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Red Blend
"Flower and melon aromas are light and easy. This feels stony and citric, while flavors of lime, orange and mango finish crystal clear, with freshness and some pulp to the texture.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"Rusty in color and earthy on the nose, with capped aromas of cedar and herbs, this mature Catalonian Cabernet is compact on the palate and fused by firm tannins. Flavors of dried berry, stone fruits and toffee finish long. This ranks as a fun challenge for Spanish wine geeks.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dry, spicy red-fruit and sawdust aromas are elegant. This is fresh, crisp and refined on the palate, with oak, plum, raspberry and tomato flavors that dry out and narrow down on a tight, well-framed finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pointed red-fruit aromas of currant and plum are light but direct. This feels fresh, with mild raspberry flavors and not a whole lot else. On the finish, mellow notes of vanilla and red plum are supported by not overly aggressive tannins. Drink this fresh Garnacha through 2015.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is a serious Cava for the money. It's mildly briny and dusty up front, with peach and apple notes filling out the nose. The palate is elegant and smooth enough, while apple and melon flavors are naturally spicy and ripe given the warm conditions of the '09 vintage. The long, nectarine-flavored finish will win you over.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is a light, floral wine by Ribera standards. Rosy aromas include baking spices and loamy red-fruit notes. The palate is kind of thin, but with enough tannic bite to make it lasting. Vanilla, raspberry, red plum and tobacco flavors finish with vanilla and coconut accents along with juicy acidity. Drink through 2016.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rubbery, dark-fruit aromas are generous and come with a blanket of mild, chocolaty oak. This is round and punchy on the palate, with raspberry, plum, herb and spice flavors. On the finish, it is fresh and not too demanding, with steady, firm tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is a nice value-priced Albariño, with a minerally nose also offers aromas of melon, apple and peach. The palate is citrusy in feel, with lemony acids. Citrus and stone-fruit flavors finish stony and crisp, with a final blast of lemon.",Spain,Albariño
Minerally peach and apple aromas are typical of the region and variety. A fairly racy palate with good weight brings standard orange and grapefruit flavors prior to a citrusy finish with a touch of pithy bitterness.,Spain,Albariño
"Minerally grapefruit, white peach, lettuce and scallion aromas are clean, inviting and textbook for Verdejo. A fresh, racy, cleansing palate holds grapefruit, orange and briny flavors. This is crisp as a whistle on the finish, but light on flavor and complexity. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dusty apple, melon and saline aromas are nice but not too intense or exact. This is tight and juicy but textured on the palate, with nectarine, peach and saline flavors. A round feeling finish offers up minerality and length.",Spain,Albariño
"Toasty, oaky aromas of popcorn and modest fruits set up an elegant feeling palate with a mild but present bubble bead. Apple, nectarine and citrus flavors finish long and pure, with a dry, citrusy feel.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Of all the Angosto 2011s, El Jefe del Tribu is the most smoky and roasted of the group. Savory aromas of beef jerky and baked blackberry filter onto a ripe, slightly flat palate. Flavors of baked black fruits are gritty and mildly stalky, while the finish tastes of cooked berry fruits and generic blackness.",Spain,Red Blend
"Leesy, bready aromas are ripe and fruity. This is soft in feel and a touch heavy, which may be a reflection of the warm 2009 vintage. Nectarine and other ripe flavors finish full and sweet. This almost tastes like a brut Cava despite being a brut nature.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Leathery plum and berry aromas come with a touch of char. This blend of Shiraz and Tempranillo feels round and solid. Familiar flavors of berry fruits and cherry are a bit spicy, while the finish tastes of black fruits and feels right.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Apple and peach aromas are basic but clean and fresh. So is the palate on this Chardonnay-Sauvignon Blanc blend. Flavors of nectarine and apple don't stray far from basic, while green apple and citrus flavors are propped up on the finish by racy acidity.",Spain,Chardonnay-Sauvignon Blanc
"Leather, meat and rubber aromas run with dark-berry and charred notes on this barrel-heavy Rioja that's full, round, chewy and bit saucy in feel. Baked, oaky flavors of vanilla, mocha and berry fruits finish with a wave of toasty oak and mocha as well as clove. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Initially, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo smells vegetal, although the nose settles on saucy tomato and bell pepper. Fairly raw and astringent on the palate, this tastes like pizza in a glass, meaning basil, oregano and tomato flavors are dominant. The finish is mildly green but feels right.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo
"Medicinality, animal notes and rubbery scents interfere with this magenta-colored Monastrell's berry aromas. Scratchy and somewhat abrasive on the palate, with high acidity, this tastes of herbal plum and medicinal raspberry, with a gripping finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"This is a highly unusual blend of Marsellan and Touriga Nacional, and it smells reduced, lemony and like cola and coffee. The mouthfeel is grating, with sandpaper tannins. Odd, herbal, citrusy notes infiltrate core blueberry flavors, while the finish is hard as nails and tannic to an extreme. Only 200 cases made.",Spain,Red Blend
"Yellow in color, this blend of 80% Macabeo and 20% Sauvignon Blanc smells waxy, with notes of lanolin, peach and papaya. It's sharp and fairly austere on the tongue, with tart, lemony flavors that end pithy, citric and slightly bitter. Drink immediately.",Spain,White Blend
"Mint and jammy plum and raspberry aromas are a touch spicy. This is astringent in feel, with dry, oaky red-berry and tomato flavors. An angular, tart finish fades quickly.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Leafy, earthy red-berry aromas are backed by a grabby, drying, tannic palate. Lightly herbal black-fruit flavors are followed by dry, rubbery cherry and plum blandness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of apple cider are oxidized and grassy. This offers mealy peach flavors that, like the nose, seem oxidized. A bland but not bad finish sends this Viura-Verdejo blend on its way.",Spain,Viura-Verdejo
"Pointed, toasty aromas of black fruits and graphite are lemony, woody and not bashful. A giant palate with rock-hard, piercing tannins is drying but generous. Flavors of wild berries, earth and oak finish toasty and tannic, with lasting acidity. Drink through 2023.",Spain,Mencía
"Concentrated, potent aromas of earthy blackberry and cassis bring notes of briar patch, prune and exotic spices. The palate is full and oaky but fresh, with flavors of berry, cassis, herb and wood grain. A heavy finish with overt oak and related spice is modern in style. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Mencía
"Concentrated, muscular aromas of leathery blackberry set up a full, grinding, powerful palate with dark, earthy flavors of toast, blackberry and black plum. A peppery, spicy finish simmers with mild heat and burn.",Spain,Tempranillo

"Leathery plum and berry aromas come with a touch of char. This blend of Shiraz and Tempranillo feels round and solid. Familiar flavors of berry fruits and cherry are a bit spicy, while the finish tastes of black fruits and feels right.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Apple and peach aromas are basic but clean and fresh. So is the palate on this Chardonnay-Sauvignon Blanc blend. Flavors of nectarine and apple don't stray far from basic, while green apple and citrus flavors are propped up on the finish by racy acidity.",Spain,Chardonnay-Sauvignon Blanc
"Minty, earthy aromas suggest Christmas spice and fruit cake. This is saturated but a bit soupy and drying. Flavors of prune, plum, raisin and spices are a touch stewed, while this finishes ripe but short on freshness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lightly leesy aromas of vanilla cookie are offset by crisp minerally apple and stone-fruit scents. This is pure and lifted by fine acidity, while flavors of apple, pineapple and lemon-lime end fresh, with a distant note of citrus pith. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"Ripe berry aromas blend nicely with earthy leathery scents. With a full and easy palate, this generous Crianza delivers blackberry and chocolate flavors that veer toward raisin and prune, especially on the finish, which is lightly toasted and dense in feel. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Oak and related toasty aromas drive the nose on this schisty-smelling wine that also shows plum and raspberry scents. A full, creamy, grabby palate is ripe and syrupy, while plum, wild berry, herbal undertones and raw oak flavors finish full, chubby and sticky, with a medicinal component.",Spain,Red Blend
"Roasted, leathery plum and berry aromas are a bit stalky. A blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha, this is balanced on the palate but also juicy and alert. Blackberry and dark plum flavors come with an herbal, slightly stalky edge, while the finish tastes authentic but baked and leathery.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rubbery berry and plum aromas come with a note of latex. In the mouth, this is juicy, bright and focused, with good raspberry and plum fruit. Textural balance is an attribute, while the finish is round, lively and full of tasty berry flavors. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Red Blend
"Vibrant black-fruit aromas come across young and vital, with a lot of oak topping. The palate is chunky, with pulpy weight and plenty of body. Blackberry and black currant are the lead flavors, and they are backed by chocolaty oak. This feels meaty and bulky, with tons of fruit-forward heft and power.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Powdery, perfumed aromas of raspberry and red plum announce a palate with ringing acidity. Plum, red currant and strawberry flavors come with moderate loamy weight, while the finish takes on an earthy quality that's balanced by shearing, tangy acidity. This is only 60% Tempranillo while the rest is Garnacha, Graciano and Mazuelo. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dusty apple and a hint of scrambled egg define the nose on this brut nature. As you'd expect given the lack of dosage, this is citric and linear in the mouth, with stony lime and green-apple flavors. The finish is refined, clean and lemony, with green-herb flavors.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dry, saline-like overtones on jumpy plum and berry aromas and a hard, tannic palate make for a tough beginning. Equally tough berry fruit flavors have skins and bitterness issues, while the finish is peppery, acidic and hard.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Hard, rubbery cherry and berry aromas lead to a raw, underdeveloped palate. This wine made from the local Valencia-region grape variety Forcallà is outright tart and tomatoey, with a touch of red-plum flavor. An herbal, rubbery, tannic finish tastes saucy.",Spain,Forcallà
"Initial stalky aromas are low on freshness and vitality, and with time, this blend of Macabeo and Chardonnay smells more artificial and soapy. Round on the palate, it tastes fairly bitter and pithy, with a modest white-fruit character that makes a soft impression.",Spain,White Blend
"Funky aromas of nutty, briny citrus fruits and apple come with a whiff of skunk. This is flat in feel, with sugary, creamy flavors of green melon. A foamy, flowery finish tastes candied and feels borderline cloying.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Lychee, lemon-lime and bath soap aromas set up a foamy, rough, coarse palate. Flavors of soapy tropical fruits seem almost artificial, and so does the finish, which is sugary sweet.",Spain,Moscato
"Gaseous aromas are thick and upfront, with a hint of lychee. This tastes and feels pithy, with a heavy skins component that causes bitterness. Amid that, this dry Muscat tastes soapy, with an oddly floral finish.",Spain,Moscatel
"On the nose, this is fully oaked, charred, spicy and familiar. In the mouth, however, it takes a dive; brutal, scouring acidity and killer tannins create a rugged, lemony mouthfeel. Flavors of toasty oak and sour black fruits devolve into a pool of tartaric acidity on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rooty initial aromas veer toward animal and stalky berry fruits as this unfolds. Raw, hard and leathery in feel, this turns out to be low on ripeness as leafy, stalky flavors take over before ending salty, with firm tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cherry, plum and spice aromas are lively, but the palate is highly citric and acidic. Short, drying sour cherry and plum flavors turn hot, peppery and ultimately bitter on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Yeasty, bready aromas of cantaloupe and citrus feed into an undefined palate that foams up on tongue. Citrus and melon flavors are bland, with powdered sugar and orange notes on the finish.",Spain,Bobal
"Candied cherry and strawberry aromas are soft, artificial and not convincing. Jammy on the palate, this tastes dull, with a touch of raspberry fruit. Bitter notes and latex dominate a flat finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Apple and lime aromas are basic and distant. This is light on the palate, while green melon, lime, apple and green-bean flavors finish grassy, leesy, tart and bitter.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Jammy aromas of plum and berry are oaky and come with a hint of rubber and/or latex. This is weighty yet balanced. Earthy flavors of baked black fruits, tea and spice are slightly minerally, while the finish is oaky and generous, with a touch of menthol and heat.",Spain,Mencía
"Airy and woody on the nose, this textbook Rioja crianza is woody, dry, light and elegant, with a smooth but juicy palate that brings raspberry, plum and brown sugar flavors to the fore. Spice and dry red-fruit flavors meld with juicy acidity on the finish. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Tempranillo

"Grapefruit, lime and leesy aromas feed into a healthy palate with adequate acidity and raciness. Pithy, briny citrus flavors of lime and orange finish with notes of grapefruit and scallion. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"Plum and currant aromas are gaseous at first, then minerally. This is tight, high in acidity and tannic. Rubbery, lightly briny cherry and plum flavors are held together by firm acidity, while this feels tight and wiry late, with herbal notes and tannic grab.",Spain,Red Blend
"Classic Albariño aromas of sea brine, tropical fruits, lees and dust precede a minerally lemony palate with tangy flavors of lemon, lime and gooseberry. This is a fresh clean example with a long stony citrusy finish.",Spain,Albariño
"This is already tan in color and showing some signs of premature aging. Aromas of white gumdrop, peach, nutmeg and wood resin set up a full, woody, resiny palate that matches the bouquet. Savory, oaky flavors of dried stone fruits—apricot in particular—finish long, nutty, savory and woody.",Spain,White Blend
"The immediate impression is that this wine is heavy, ripe and oaky. Sawdust and wood grain are the lead aromas. In the mouth, this chunky Priorat is hard, with grating tannins. Hickory and toasted berry flavors finish hot and resiny.",Spain,Red Blend
"Apple, pear, clover honey and mineral aromas make for a fresh, clean nose. Similarly, the palate is fresh and zesty, with crisp flavors of orange, grapefruit and nectarine. A fresh, stony finish fits the bill.",Spain,Pansa Blanca
"A dark tint and ripe aromas of blackberry, black plum and leather are appealing and inviting. This is weighty and full-bodied, with blackberry, boysenberry and cassis flavors. There's not a lot of nuance or complexity, but overall this is clean, tasty and generous.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Concentrated, compact aromas of black fruits are generous but also monotonous and low on character. A big, bulky palate is round but offers enough acidic kick to keep everything above water. Baked, flat flavors of black fruits and roasted meat finish smooth but low on pulse. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This opens with barrel-based aromas of resin and spice. It's round, creamy and Burgundian on the palate, with flavors of spiced apple, walnut and a hint of oxidation. Things flatten on the finish, which tastes yeasty and like toffee.",Spain,Godello
"Crisp plum and floral aromas rest on rocky base and offer up balsamic notes. This Monastrell-driven blend is full in body, with spicy, herbal, wild-brush flavors accenting core dark plum and berry. A lasting finish is herbal, deep and potent. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Red Blend

"Aromas of candied berries, cinnamon, nutmeg and compost are present on the nose. An edgy, tannic mouthfell and baked, oaky flavors of stewed berry fruits and spice finish hard and tannic.",Spain,Red Blend

"Cherry and plum aromas are accented by buttery oak, leather and animal notes. Solid in feel with firm tannins, this warm-vintage Tempranillo is ripe, loamy and loaded with berry and cassis flavors. A lightly raisiny finish is friendly and round. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Tempranillo
"If oaky whites are your thing, this barrel-aged Viura is a good choice. Waxy, floral aromas of gardenia, lilly, cured ham and resiny oak play against white-fruit scents. The palate is not blowsy or resiny, while woody flavors of spice and white pepper accent core flavors of peach and baked apple.",Spain,Viura
"García Figuero had a great year in 2010, as did many high-end Ribera del Duero wineries. This reserva is heady up front, with malty aromas of vanilla, barrel resin, tobacco, blackberry and cassis.

"Earthy, inky, sweet and jammy on the nose, this brings just the right hint of raisin. It feels narrow and firmly tannic, with wide flavors of blackberry, prune, raisin and chocolate.

"Red-fruit aromas come with notes of leather, spice and stalkiness. Spiky acidity creates a sharp mouthfeel that turns earthier as the acids fade.

Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tinta de Toro

A blend of 75% Cabernet Franc and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a dark specimen, with black-fruit and raisiny aromas that turn herbal with time. It has rubbery tannins and flavors of plum and herb. Good as a whole but sort of squeeky and hard in feel. A blend of 60% Garnacha and 40% Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Jumpy and nervy smelling, with tottering aromas of jammy berry and strawberry. It feels dilute at first, but more structure and body appear as the wine unfolds. The flavor of jammy raspberry is somewhat herbal, and the finish is light.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Imperial is CVNE's most accessible and affordable top-end Rioja, and what a winner it is in 2010. Cool, toasty aromas show sweet maple and vanilla notes along with berry and cassis scents. Fresh but weighty and elegant, this deals ripe berry and loamy earth flavors in front of a mellow finish that's clean and not too demanding. Drink now through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend

"Spain's preeminent varietal Cabernet is excellent in its 40th rendition. This single-vineyard wine opens with dark, brooding aromas of rooty spice, licorice, tar, herbs, cassis and prune. In the mouth, this is wiry and tight at the core, but friendly around the edges. Flavors of currant, toast, vanilla, pepper and barbecue sauce finish with ripping acidity but also cuddly, creamy weight. Drink from 2017 through 2030.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon

"Earth, cola, berry, toast and leather aromas share the bouquet. The palate is narrow and pinched by firm tannins, while the flavor profile deals a mix of herb, toast and plum. Warm, earthy and oaky on the finish, the wine carries a lemony accent and satisfying length.",Spain,Red Blend
"Apart from its note of fresh apple and hint of juniper, the nose is fairly neutral. It feels clean, crisp and cleansing, with pear and nectarine flavors that finish light, with medium intensity and length. Drink right away for maximum freshness and expression.",Spain,Albariño

"Stalky, soupy berry aromas come up shy on elegance. This feels clampy and hard with rocky tannins. Standard berry fruit flavors are overshadowed by gritty stalky blackened accents, while the finish is grating and uncushioned but long.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard and oaky cherry aromas filter into a tangy, zesty, clampy palate. Plum and other red-berry fruit flavors finish raw and rugged, with overt oak character and a touch of minty, herbal green.",Spain,Garnacha

"Dusty spice and red-berry aromas are a fine opening to this blend of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah. It's fairly full bodied but not heavy, with fine balance and bright flavors of cherry and berry that come in layered waves. A toasty, dry finish with spice and good acidity closes out this easy-to-like Spanish red. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Red Blend
"By and large, this is a good Priorat to drink or hold, because it should still improve. Both the bouquet and palate are oaky and fiery, with cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors. On the finish, things turn buttery before settling on rooty and staunch. The more air this gets, the more it comes around. Drink now through 2018.",Spain,Red Blend
"If you like heavyweight Tempranillo, this is a textbook rendition. It's deep and dark, with earth, leather and oak in addition to monster black fruit on the nose. Feels lush, powerful and layered, with bursting blackberry, spice, mocha and vanilla flavors. Quite black and spicy on the finish. Drink from 2012 through 2016.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Textbook Rioja gran reserva in every way. It's light and smoky smelling, with brown sugar, fine cologne and cedary aromas. Generous but well-cut in the mouth, with fig, mushroom, raspberry and spiced plum flavors. Fresh on the finish, with light herb flavors and good weight. Drink now through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is a polished, smooth, ripe-smelling Toro with an inky color and earthy undertones to the bouquet. Full, tannic and voluminous, this tastes mostly of blackberry and prune, while the finish is similar in taste and lush in texture. This is more forward and ripe than complex and nuanced; drink through 2021.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Dusty, clammy, white fruit aromas are generic. This is pulpy in feel with a vague focus. Leesy, pithy citrus flavors are standard and short on personality, while this finishes adequately with a mild citric lift.",Spain,Albariño
"Popcorn and apple aromas ride highest on a lightly baked and toasty bouquet. This feels clean and correct, but basic. Flavors of spiced apple and melon blend with fresh celery and lettuce notes in front of a minerally lime-tinged finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Stalky, soupy berry aromas come up shy on elegance. This feels clampy and hard with rocky tannins. Standard berry fruit flavors are overshadowed by gritty stalky blackened accents, while the finish is grating and uncushioned but long.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Roasted and rubbery smelling, this has heavy oak influence that yields notes of mint and shoe. Shearing on the palate despite its body, this has flavors of oak-based vanilla, mint and sweet-and-sour plum. Prieto Picudo is a difficult grape to make into good wine.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"This smells like barbecue and Eastern European oak. It feels flat and static, with woody resin and savory flavors to go with notes of nectarine and white grape.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Oily on the nose, this has a distinct whiff of matchstick and popcorn. It feels dry—like almond skins—with oily flavors of walnuts and white fruits. The finish is marked with a mild bitterness as well.",Spain,Macabeo
The candied red-fruit aroma is soft yet snappy. It tastes briny and citrusy before ending with a persistent peppery bitterness and lively acidity.,Spain,Garnacha
"The mildly floral nose leads to a lean and acidic palate, with flavors of lemon and green apple.",Spain,Muscat
"With dusty apple and mineral aromas, this feels healthy and plump, with apple, pear and lime flavors that sit in front of a citric and mildly green finish. Good and normal as Rueda wines go.",Spain,Verdejo
"Cedar cigar box and berry aromas become significantly more charred and toasted upon airing. It feels good, with plum, berry and plenty of burnt toast in the flavor package. It finishes dark and spicy, with a leftover burnt note.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is mellow upfront, but it also has solid plum and berry aromas. On the palate it's grabby but good, with tough tannins that support dark plum and savory notes. Chewy and chocolaty on the finish, it has a mossy accent and firm leftover tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Varietally correct on the nose, this has green apple, grapefruit and floral aromas. It feels basic, tangy and linear, with notes of melon, citrus and a dry, crisp finish that's mildly briny and a touch bitter.",Spain,Verdejo
"Likable from the start, with black fruit, baking spice and exotic sandalwood notes, this is firm and drying in feel, with a blend of dark berry, toast and peppery spice flavors. It remains dry on the finish, with a pinch of heat that food should tame.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Peach and apple aromas are fruity but not precise or minerally. This has peachy acidity but a wide, unfocused palate. Flavors of peach and nectarine are tasty but lack the crispness that Albariño is known for.",Spain,Albariño
"Slightly nutty aromas are not terribly exciting, but in the mouth this is better; it's fresh, with a proper acid-to-body ratio. Flavors of dry apple and nectarine finish mildly bitter, with a distinct note of almond skins. This is 75% Viura and 25% Chardonnay.",Spain,White Blend
"Woody aromas of vanilla, blackberry, black plum and cassis are lactic and creamy. Concentrated and huge on the palate, but with enviable balance, this powerful, ripe Garnacha deals blackberry and dark-plum flavors prior to an oaky, spicy, chocolaty finish with peppery, blackened spice notes. This is a monster wine with 16.5% abv, but it can handle it.",Spain,Garnacha
"Blackberry, cassis, coffee and charred aromas make for a smoky, healthy, attractive bouquet. This is dense, deep, tannic and a bit rubbery and bouncy in feel. Tea, herb, chocolate and baked blackberry flavors end with cocoa and herbal, earthy notes. Drink this ripe gran reserva through 2023.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Stocky plum and smashed-berry aromas offer notes of garrigue and wild animal. As for mouthfeel, this Syrah is layered, chewy and pulpy, with power in reserve. Deep berry and cassis flavors are darkened by toast and spice notes, while the finish is long, spicy and only builds in fruit. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Red Blend
"A mellow, neutral nose doesn't push the envelope. In the mouth, this is round but punchy, with some excess weight. Flavors of apple juice, pear and melon finish with flavors of lime, apple cider and powdered sugar.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Grassy, compost-like aromas carry a peanut accent and not much vivid fruit. This pinches down on what amounts to a clampy palate, while crisp, mildly green berry flavors finish minty and peppery.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Harmonious but mild cherry and raspberry aromas are light and nice. This is substantive enough, with rubbery tannins and some chewiness to the palate. Generic flavors of raspberry and red plum finish mellow and easy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Despite some grit and tar on the nose, this Rioja opens well with spicy cherry and plum aromas. A standard, mild palate is satisfactory, while lightly roasted slightly briny plum and berry flavors end with a hint of saltiness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An idiosyncratic wine, offering a yeasty orange marmalade aroma followed by a razor-sharp palate with sour citrus and apricot flavors. It's grating and citric on the finish, with a yeasty offset.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Heavy and dark in color, this is stalky on the nose, with a compost component that doesn't scream “fresh and ready.” It feels fairly snappy, but it tastes tart and slightly vegetal before finishing with rhubarb flavors.",Spain,Trepat
"A tight note of spearmint defines the nose. The palate follows suit: It's pinched and hard, with outsized acidity leading to a lemony palate, with searing cherry and red plum flavors. It doesn't waiver on the finish.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rubbery on the nose, this has berry aromas lurking below. On the palate, it feels acidic, with tart raspberry flavors. It's lean on the finish, with a touch of oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is heavy and raisiny, with ripe earth and mineral aromas that are suggestive of Port. It feels loaded and scratchy, with licorice, prune and pepper flavors that finish short and with some heat. A bullish style to drink now.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Bits of grass and green tobacco infiltrate the otherwise sturdy and solid nose on this Tempranillo-based blend that includes Merlot, Cabernet and Syrah. It feels medium bodied and fresh, with red plum, raspberry, herb and coffee flavors. The finish turns leafy, chocolaty and herbal.",Spain,Red Blend
"Satinela has been on the upswing in recent years as it has become more complex. This vintage smells of lime, mineral and dusty apple. It feels fresh and right for the style, with Bartlett pear, lime and dry spice flavors.",Spain,White Blend
"Dense and dark, this has earthy, crusty berry aromas and a sprinkle of herb on the nose. It hits with aggression but settles down nicely to offer raspberry, plum and savory herb flavors. Lively acidity allows for a long finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Citrusy aromas suggest orange juice and grapefruit pith. This feels balanced, with apple, papaya, melon and banana flavors that feed into a sweet-tasting finish that's slightly mealy in feel and flavor. Good and tasty, but drink immediately.",Spain,Verdejo
"Raisiny, pruny aromas are all that register on this rubbery, jammy Garnacha. Flavors of sweet plum, raspberry and raisin are chunky, while the finish is raisiny in flavor and rubbery in feel.",Spain,Garnacha
Mild aromas of apple and generic white fruits are friendly enough. This has a monotone citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of tangerine and grapefruit. A bit of stalky corn and hay flavor rises up on the finish.,Spain,Chardonnay
"Initially this smells green and candied, with overripe and underripe aromas. The palate is chunky and bulky, while flavors of black fruits and green herbs finish grassy, with notes of oregano and tarragon. Overall this is heavy, extracted, sweet and sticky.",Spain,Red Blend
"Oaky, lean red-fruit aromas precede a scratchy, thin, resiny feeling palate. This tastes of oak on top of underdeveloped, stunted red berries, while the finish is herbal, woody tasting and heavily spiced.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Wheaty, flat aromas are indicators that this is losing its luster. The palate is chunky, with melon, mango and canned peach flavors. Best to wait for a newer vintage.",Spain,Albariño
"Tarry, stalky aromas fail to make much of a statement. This is high in acid and rugged in the mouth, with a mixture of herbal red-fruit flavors and distinct stalkiness. A grating finish is racy and hot.",Spain,Garnacha
"Stony minerality blends with raisin, leather and leafy berry aromas. This offers cheek-stanching citric acidity but not enough body to absorb it. Flavors of herbal red plum are choppy and turn gritty and fiery on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Jumpy, young aromas of wet dog, plum, cherry and beet root set up a racy, high-acid palate. This tastes like medicinal raspberry and red plum, while the finish is light, scouring and fresh, with no oak character.",Spain,Mencía
"Animal hide and roasted, stalky aromas bring overall quality into question. This feels raw, choppy and drawing, while flavors of stalky berry fruits are leathery and roasted. Hard tannins and green notes influence the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Funky aromas of animal fur and lively berry are not that inviting. In the mouth, this has a narrow feel and high acidity. Herbal, tart flavors of plum and red currant are almost sour, while the finish is on the green and herbal side.",Spain,Garnacha
"Rubbery aromas of pencil eraser are also smoky and odd, with the suggestion of clove. In the mouth this is pinched at first, then more oaky and creamy, but also rubbery. Roasted plum and stewed berry flavors finish tannic, with latent berry and cherry notes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Peachy aromas are less than perky, while in the mouth this is lemony, narrow and citric. Flavors of lemon and tangerine finish with stony mineral notes but also a drawing citric acidity.",Spain,Albariño
"Nectarine and white peach aromas are pithy, pointed and briny like sea water. This feels citrusy and pulpy, while zesty citric flavors of grapefruit, scallion and green herbs finish with residual pithy briny notes.",Spain,White Blend
"Burnt hay, grapefruit and waxy apple aromas lead to a palate with briny citrus flavors. Pithy grapefruit and orange flavors carry the finish, which is quick and light in weight.",Spain,Viura
"Aromatically, this is pretty good as dry apple and a pinch of green herbs work the nose. In the mouth, however, this is shear and citric, with zesty, almost sour flavors of tangerine, orange and grapefruit. The finish is similar, with thinly cut acidity causing tartness.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Grassy aromas of green tobacco and alfalfa come in front of a lightly abrasive palate. Herbal red-berry flavors are suggestive of minty cranberry, cherry and raspberry. This turns more fruity and less green on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Simple red-berry aromas are about as good as this gets. In the mouth, it's wet but dilute. Flavors of pithy citrus and grass finish with grapefruit and bitter flavors. This is basic at best and empty at worst.",Spain,Rosado
"This is as basic as Albariño gets, with aromas of sweet apple and pear. It feels round and a bit soft, with fleshy peach and dry melon flavors. The finish is pithy, with a white pepper note and an indication that the wine is starting to fade. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"Leather and berry aromas are welcoming and veer toward mint. It feels solid and textured, with lightly oaked, earthy flavors of meaty berry and vanilla. It tastes roasted and shows medium intensity on the finish. A good crianza from a marginal vintage.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Yellow in color, with buttercup, wild flower and leesy white-fruit aromas, this feels spritzy, with melon, papaya and white peach flavors. It's mildly minerally and dry in flavor on the finish. Drink as soon as possible.",Spain,Albariño
Twizzler and other red candy aromas lead to a creamy feeling yet acidic palate that tastes like raspberry extract. Sharp acidity prevents what would otherwise be a cloying wine.,Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"This smells like applesauce and pear, feeling tight as a drum on the palate, with sharp nectarine and apricot flavors. It's tart and crimped on the finish.",Spain,Viognier
"The nose smells flat, with a scant scent of peach. It feels acidic and lacks body, with flavors of sour apple, dried papaya and bitter almond. A blend of 50% Macabeo and 50% Airen.",Spain,White Blend
Loud citrus and berry aromas precede an overloaded palate that carries stalky plum flavors. Pickled tasting on the finish.,Spain,Rosé
"Salmon in color, this is pulpy and perfumed on the nose, with an artificial leaning. Overly foamy on the palate, this has a bitter, herbal flavor.",Spain,Garnacha
"Blackberry, black currant and toasty oak make for a dark, charred, manly nose. This is full but not heavy, with racy acidity and firm tannins. Blackberry, baked plum and savory flavors finish with notes of prune and leather as well as salted cured meat. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Condensed aromas of blackberry, prune and raisin get a boost of darkness and depth from coffee and mocha. This feels tannic and firm, with mocha, coconut and other oak-based flavors. Finishing flavors of vanilla and coconut are full, bulky and rich. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fresh berry and plum aromas come with earth and herbal accents, which only boost the bouquet's complexity. The palate on this blend of Carignan, Garnacha and Syrah is structured and tight, with earthy, lightly toasted flavors of black cherry and plum. Spice, cocoa and oaky dryness define the finish. Drink through 2016.",Spain,Red Blend
"Floral, dusty aromas are encouraging, but this is overly citric and aggressive on the palate. Lemon, underripe stone fruit and minerally flavors turn tart and pithy on the finish.",Spain,Godello
"Bulky, stewy, jammy aromas of prune and raisin are an accurate indication of what's to come. This is pure prune juice, with mushy weight and sweet, syrupy flavors. Fig, raisin and chocolate flavors pop up on the finish, but overall this is soupy and drastically overripe.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dominant aromas of char and rubber give way to chocolaty oak and vanilla on what amounts to a confected, forced bouquet. This feels flush and oaky. Flavors of creamy oak, vanilla, milk chocolate and herbal berry finish resiny and woody.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With a tan tint and aromas of banana, undefined stone fruits and slight chemical, this is not all that inviting. The palate is on the flat side, while pithy flavors of melon and citrus finish with a bitter note of almond skins.",Spain,Viura-Chardonnay
"Earthy, mealy aromas don't bring much freshness to the nose. This is acidic and sharp on the palate, while flavors of sour plum and raspberry finish scouring.",Spain,Mencía
"On the nose, this is gaseous and mealy smelling, and the palate is flat, with flavors of pithy, bitter white fruits.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Saline and nettle aromas are a lot like underripe Sauvignon Blanc. This is a sour, cutting wine with flavors of lime, grapefruit and underripe passion fruit. The finish is overly acidic and citric.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Chemical notes sit atop aromas of peach pit and green banana. This is narrow in the mouth, with mealy melon and tropical fruit flavors. A peachy finish lacks finesse and more.",Spain,Viura-Chardonnay
"Sweet melon and peach aromas are candied. In the mouth, this is awkward, fizzy and cloying. The flavor profile has little positive to offer, while the finish turns bitter and grassy tasting.",Spain,Chardonnay
"The cold, rainy conditions of 2008 must have affected this wine. Vegetal aromas, vinegar and green notes drive the nose, while the flavor profile is briny and pickled to an extreme. High acidity and green flavors draw down the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lively, piercing and powerful on the bouquet, which is solid as stone and delivers loads of black fruit and integrated oak. Feels full, round and deep, with full-out black fruit flavors strengthened by espresso, mocha and molasses. Toasty and deep on the finish, with tobacco and spice accents. Drink from 2012 through 2015.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Floral blueberry and black-currant aromas are jammy. Following the nose, this Garnacha feels chunky and low in acidity. Jammy flavors of blueberry and cassis end in a pudgy but friendly way. Drink this low-acid offering sooner rather than later.",Spain,Garnacha
"Straightforward peach, nectarine and apple aromas are fleshy, as is the palate, which puts out leesy creamy flavors of apple and green banana. A leesy, low-acid finish is plump and lacks follow through. Drink immediately.",Spain,Godello
"Untamed plum and cherry aromas are a bit strained. This everyday Garnacha is fresh and fruity in feel, with good but standard plum and cherry flavors. An edgy grating finish with a spot of oak character wraps this up.",Spain,Garnacha
"Citrus and peach pit aromas are mild. This is clean but basic on the palate with citrus, nectarine and lime flavors. A clean refreshing finish is a nice way to wrap things up. This is Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo.",Spain,White Blend
"This is an ideal summer white. It's light but crisp on the bouquet, with whispy pear, apple and citrus aromas. Freshness reigns on the palate despite there being pulpy citrus flavors. Another wave of citrus carries the clear finish to a precise ending. Delicious white wine.",Spain,Albariño
"Like many Griñon wines, this is dense and earthy on the nose, with ripe berry and marzipan aromas. A round, layered, full-bodied palate shows hard, unresolved tannins and ripe, earthy flavors of blackberry, spice, herbs and chocolate. A firm, textured finish with integrated flavors is bullish but classy. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a very nice aged Rioja with baked, earthy aromas of spice along with dried raspberry and plum. The mouthfeel is clean and solid in a normal, easy way, while flavors of plum and berry fruits carry notes of coconut and vanilla. A mild, warm, lightly baked finish cements this wine's status. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A simple bouquet offers light apple and melon aromas, while the palate shows some malic acidity before it softens. Melon, apple and a touch of butter work together to create a mild flavor profile, while this is mellow and short on the finish.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Heavy oak aromas rest forcefully on top of plum and black cherry scents. This is fresh and proper in feel, with dominant oaky graininess and medicinal berry flavors that finish woody like a plank.",Spain,Garnacha Blend
"Despite not very good harvest conditions, Aurus is still generous in 2008. Smells lush and dense, with boysenberry, creamy oak, rubber and charred aromas. Layered and tannic feeling, with blackberry, chocolate and dark spice flavors. Toasty and like digging into a fudge cake on the finish, with a deep feel and clarity. Drink now through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Oaky on first take, then earthy and weighty, with black fruit aromas and minerally notes. Feels tight initially, but with air it softens and soon come flavors of thyme, herbal berry and chocolate. Crisp and nicely balanced, with a solid finish. Almost what you'd call a value Priorat.",Spain,Red Blend
"Familiar aromas of black fruit, licorice and earth get it going, followed by saturated body weight that reaches all corners of the mouth while displaying earthy, chunky blackberry and black cherry flavors. Flush, comfortable and slightly heavy. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"From Miguel Angel de Gregorio of Finca Allende, this is a nice, thorough, creamy white with aromas of white fruits, vanilla and straw. The palate has spiced peach, apple and pear flavors, and the finish is exceedingly creamy and deep. Shows elegance and adequate power, but needs to be drunk soon.",Spain,Viura
"Good, pure, dark and teetering on powerful, with strong, rich black plum aromas. The mouth is staunch and balanced, with full dark fruit flavors of blackberry along with bitter chocolate. Solid and clean throughout. A winner in its price range.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smooth, fresh aromas suggest apple blossoms and sea air. The palate offers a proper zesty mouthfeel, zingy acidity, natural creaminess and nice flavors of green apple, sour melon and pineapple. At the end, lemony zap and lemongrass grace the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Simple light aromas of vanilla and lees set up a round palate with ample acidic kick. For the most part, this is chunky and weighty, with apple and peach flavors, while mild bitterness in the form of peach pit closes this out.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dusty, citrusy aromas of pineapple turn more tropical with airing. This is 60% Garnacha Blanca, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, and it's a bit flat on the palate. Flavors of white fruits are candied but also bitter, while this finishes with honeyed sweetness offset by pithy bitterness.",Spain,White Blend
"Radiator dust, lees and vanilla cookie aromas precede a chunky flat palate. Flavors of lime, melon and apple are as basic as it gets, while the finish is bland except for a hint of pithy bitterness.",Spain,Macabeo
"Given the difficulties of this cool vintage, this is an excellent wine with dark berry, herb, spice and vanilla aromas. It's firm on the palate like most 2008s, with flavors of blackberry, chocolate and oak spice leading to an earthy tasting finish. Drink now–2016.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Teso la Monja picked a good vintage to introduce this entry-level Toro. Romanico is big and candied on the nose, with floral berry aromas, milk chocolate and a touch of raisin. On the palate, spunky berry fruit flavors blend with juniper notes, while the finish delivers herbal leftovers, a pinch more juniper and commendable length and smoothness.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This has a lot of good things going in its favor, for example depth, power and richness. It's also raisiny and oaky, with stewy core flavors of baked berry, cassis, roasted meat and vanilla. The finish is chewy and thick, with vanilla and pastry flavors along with grating tannins. By no means is this wine perfect, but it offers a lot of what's good about Toro; drink now.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A nice, floral, medium-bodied Rioja that should not steer anyone wrong. The nose is harmonized and not overpowering, while the feel is good and easy and the flavors of berry, plum and mild chocolaty oak work well together. Holds its line on the finish as well.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Broad, bold and buttery, with aromas of toasted white peach, flower blossom, vanilla and mild oxidation. The blend is 65% Viura with Malvasia and white Garnacha, and overall it's a round, stout, creamy wine with apple, vanilla and toasty, resiny flavors and finishing notes. A little heavy and sticky but nice for barrel-aged white Rioja.",Spain,White Blend
"Floral lilac and plum aromas greet you, followed by a chunky, frothy palate with crisp core acidity and toasty flavors of baked cherry and caramel. Finishes smooth and long, with peppery notes and dryness.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Rubbery but fresh smelling, with sharp acidity that creates big-time juiciness but also an angular feel. Tastes of zippy, tangy red fruits that are crisp and sizzle away. Gets a bit more deep and earthy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite strange and funky smelling, with uncommon grass, floral, hickory and blueberry aromas. The palate feels fine but has a sweet, faux-weedy core flavor that's offset by candied berry flavors. Tastes of licorice and lactic creaminess on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Funky and smelling of pine and tarragon. That aromatic sharpness carries straight to the palate, where the feel is narrow and the flavors are short and tangy, with little to no big-time berry fruit. Simply an acceptable underperformer that's tough and sharp.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stone-fruit and apple aromas grace a mild bouquet. This feels solid but generic, with chunky peach, citrus and pithy flavors. On the finish, this Verdejo becomes more waxy and heavy in feel.",Spain,Verdejo
"Briny, leesy aromas are funky and sweaty, not clean and lean like most Txakoli. Snappy, citric and decidedly not spritzy, this tastes of lemon, underripe nectarine and tart green apple. A cleansing seltzer-like finish is the closing act.",Spain,Hondarrabi Zuri
"Aromas of raw oak, eucalyptus and gritty berry fruits are hot and leafy. This Tempranillo-based blend feels choppy with aggressive grating tannins. Flavors of baked roasted berry fruits are also herbal, green and leafy, while this finishes crisp, raw and tomatoey in flavor.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Shy honeyed aromas of tropical fruits wind up at banana. This feels fleshy and not direct, while soft powdery flavors of leesy melon and papaya finish with notes of oxidation, as if this is already starting to fade.",Spain,Godello
"This wine is fresh as can be, with loads of friendly black-fruit aromas upfront. The palate is juicy and bright, not the least bit hard or tannic, with huge flavors of berry fruits, baking spices, chocolate and even some bacon. This delivers a lot for the price.",Spain,Garnacha
"Tarry blackberry and plum aromas are good and lusty. This is a round, medium-bodied blend of Garnacha, Carignan and Syrah that's ripe but not overpowering. Flavors of berry and plum are red in nature and finish with spicy notes and a good feel.",Spain,Red Blend
"For Toro, this is earthy and slightly herbal as opposed to ripe and jammy. Aromas of mulch, leather and herbal berry lead into a firm, rocky palate with rooty flavors of burnt leaves, black fruits and oregano. A tight, compact finish with moderate flavors is a bit closed and hard.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A bit earthy and leafy on the nose and palate, with lightweight strawberry and raspberry aromas and flavors. The wine has a clacky, almost metallic feel to it along with hints of tobacco and green bean. Vanilla and sweetness push the finish, which is also slightly green. Hails from Cádiz in southwestern Spain.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"A steal for six bucks; the nose is floral and black, but under control. Meanwhile, the palate is bouncy, round and balanced, with juicy black plum and wild berry flavors. Clean and solid.",Spain,Grenache
"Pink meets orange in terms of hue, while the nose gives a nice blend of sweet and snappy berry and citrus. The palate has a little weight and heft along with dry, white-peppery flavors of nectarine and apricot. Pithy, citrusy and healthy throughout. Good wine for the money.",Spain,Rosé
"Sort of scratchy and generic on the nose, with reasonably fresh red fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is angular and clipped by piercing acidity, while the flavors are of nice but regular black cherry and plum. Fairly juicy and fresh as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Waxy, peachy aromas are less than fresh, and the palate follows that lead via soft, pithy flavors of orange and melon. Shows little grip or structure for Godello and the finish fails to bring it home with kick or pop. Already past its prime. Tasted twice.",Spain,Godello
"Smells earthy, murky and a little raisiny, and then in the mouth it scratches with grating tannins in support of floral cherry and tart red fruit flavors. Finishes sort of hollow and sour; standard issue at best.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A fine Cava with easygoing white fruit aromas and a cushioned, full and round palate. Tastes rich and honeyed, with toasty, nutty, dry apple and pear flavors. Elegant and complex, with texture and style.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A traditional style of Rioja with earthy, peppery, dry aromas in front of a healthy, lively palate. Tastes like vanilla and buttery oak on top of zesty but restrained raspberry and red plum. Shows spice, character and a wholeness that makes it a winner. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Yellow in color, with heavy dusty flat aromas of apple and citrus, this feels low on acidity and thus flat. Cidery apple and lime flavors finish chunky and leesy with an oily texture.",Spain,Albariño
Dusty apple aromas come with a vanilla-like note of animal crackers. A plump but diluted palate shows mediocre wan flavors of nectarine and apple in front of a flat finish that's losing steam. Drink immediately or wait for a new vintage.,Spain,Albariño
"This is smelling a bit oxidized and wayward. Spritzy in feel, this blend of 70% Albariño, 15% Loureira and 15% Treixadura tastes pithy and like citrus skins. Pithy, borderline bitter flavors of white grapefruit drive the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"This blend of Viura and Malvasia is mild, low on aromatic punch and suggestive of saline solution. This is friendly but flat in feel, with modest structure. Leesy flavors of peach and apple finish chalky and grabby.",Spain,White Blend
"Waxy peach and apple aromas come with a leesy cookie-like component. This is 50% each Sauvignon Blanc and Garnacha Blanca, and it feels both plump and watery. Flavors of quince and apple are diluted and distant, while the finish is mild.",Spain,White Blend
"Fleshy aromas of melon and peach are leesy and soft. This is more angular and acidic on the palate, which fails to fan out. Nectarine and salty briny flavors finish with papaya and peach notes.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay
"Boysenberry and blueberry aromas mixed with oak scents amount to an inviting, solid bouquet. In the mouth, this is healthy, full-bodied and showing plenty of kick. Flavors of berry fruits, plum and roasted notes end with jammy berry flavors and a good texture. Drink now–2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Exotic blueberry and fir tree aromas set up a jammy palate with soft tannins and flavors of blackberry, dark cherry, toast and a hint of burnt beef. Widespread tannins cause the finish to feel mellow and not that pointed. This is a very good Spanish wine that's not too complex. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"With a hint of rubber and asphalt, the bouquet on this value wine is generous and topped with blackberry and dark plum aromas. The palate is grabby, with clampy tannins and black-fruit flavors mixed with chocolate and spice. The earthy, lightly herbal finish with rubbery nuances is nice.",Spain,Garnacha
"Light peach, apricot and buttercup aromas are better at first but lose steam with airing. This Xarello is lemony, racy and gives off plenty of kick on the palate, while flavors of citrus and melon are equally creamy and zesty. This holds firm on the finish, with brightness offset by a creamy texture.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"Oily and frankly a bit skunky on the nose. The palate is spritzed yet soft, with chunky, blowsy, generic white fruit flavors. Doesn't inspire; this winery's red wines are better.",Spain,Picapoll
"Burnt rubber and a certain stemmy, roasted character is draped over the nose and palate. It has a decent, normal feel to it but the flavors of strawberry and raspberry are herbal and burnt. Tastes and smells rubbery and not fully clean.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mild lime and mineral aromas draw interest, but the wine's palate is medium spritzy and sour, with sharp, lemony flavors and a dilute feel. Seems caught between the flat and lightly carbonated style of Txakoli and ends up in no man's land.",Spain,Hondarrabi Zuri
"Tan like cream soda, with a weird, faded bouquet of banana pudding and resiny oak. Soft and weakly structured except for lasting acidity, while it tastes like fermented apples and finishes on bitter walnut. A strange bird made from Sauvignon Blanc and white Tempranillo.",Spain,White Blend
"Like most base-level Garnachas, this one has a sweet, candied aromatic cover. But unlike many it has depth, purity and avoids boring, offensive sweetness. The flavors of raspberry and boysenberry are bright, and it maintains balance and integrity through the finish. A nice wine for under $10.",Spain,Grenache-Syrah
"This aged wine hits most of the right keys. It's sexy and racy on the bouquet, with tobacco, orange peel, rooty cherry and tree bark aromas. It's a bit sharp and lean in the mouth at this point, with flavors of tomato, raisin, dry berry, cocoa and spice. Gets more acidic as it sits. Drink or hold.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Here's yet another excellent wine from this modern-leaning Riojano producer. The nose is full of spice, tobacco and deep berry aromas. Feels quasi-jammy and very rich, with thickness and mild tannins. Tastes baked, like a mix of prune, spicecake and chocolate. Warm and figgy on the finish, and ready to drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Thick, raisiny berry aromas come with notes of licorice, mineral and black peppercorn. Feels tight and juicy, with zesty red fruit flavors, sweet black fruit flavors and shadings of schisty minerality and licorice. Smooth and sturdy on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"This wine pushes the envelope on concentration and ripeness. It's full of prune, raisin and licorice on the nose, but also a lot of weight. It's quite jammy and soft by Priorat standards, as intense blackberry and molten fudge flavors take over. Chewy, warm and ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fleshy aromas of melon and peach are leesy and soft. This is more angular and acidic on the palate, which fails to fan out. Nectarine and salty briny flavors finish with papaya and peach notes.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay
"Green grassy aromas are modest and watery. This feels oily, but with decent acidity. Oxidized flavors of stone fruits finish wheaty, bland and eggy.",Spain,Tempranillo Blanco
"Apple and melon aromas are mild, straightforward and devoid of oak. A chunky melony palate doesn't have much stuffing, while this tastes of mild peach, papaya and other tropical fruits. Overall, this is inoffensive but hollow.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Orange peel aromas are a bit stony. In the mouth, this feels like it's past its prime, with little to no intensity or acidity. Mild apple flavors are sweet, mealy and honeyed, while the ending is leesy and mushy.",Spain,Albariño
"Leesy, creamy aromas of vanilla are simple, with a note of apple offering some crispness. The palate is regular in feel, with adequate acidity. Flavors of green apple, lettuce and herbs culminate with mild bitterness and green notes.",Spain,White Blend
"Leesy aromas of wheat and corn are low on fruit and general appeal. This feels regular at best. Grassy gaseous flavors of bitter melon, lime and apple finish leesy and uncommitted, with flabby weight. For whatever reason, this is below prior benchmarks.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"An oily bouquet lacks freshness while smelling a bit oxidized and like mushrooms. This has a chunky palate with oxidized, somewhat bitter flavors of papaya and citrus fruits. A pithy mildly bitter finish struggles to show its virtues.",Spain,Albariño
"A light tan color and dusty sweaty aromas of apricot, matchstick and onion set up a clampy, pithy, citrusy palate. Flavors of nectarine and orange are mild, low on stuffing and grabby on the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Fleshy, unfocused aromas of apple and peach are a touch oxidized. This Chardonnay feels bland. Flavors of melon and peach lack tension and character, while there's not much flavor to the finish other than mild apple and some bitterness.",Spain,Chardonnay
"This is a clean, fresh style of Garnacha with floral black cherry aromas offset by a minty note. The palate has a zingy feel and crisp, fresh plum, raspberry and dry herb flavors. As a whole it's focused and uncomplicated; this is very good Garnacha from one of the Valencia region's better producers.",Spain,Garnacha
"This big, dark, rubbery smelling Ribera wine is rugged and pushy, with mild volatility on the nose along with a whiff of spent coffee grinds. A clampy, bullish palate with rock-hard tannins sets up rubbery black-fruit flavors in front of a rough and tumble finish. Overall this is very good but hard and tannic. Hold for a year then drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of leather, dried cherry, vanilla and leafy earthiness get this gran reserva moving. In the mouth, it's a touch choppy and wiry, with leafy, roasted flavors of savory plum and spice. This is shy on the finish, with a hint of spice and chocolate. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Composed, balanced and with all the dots connected; this is what we like about basic, affordable Rioja. It's fleshy yet fresh, with snappy cherry and raspberry flavors accented by a wave of vanilla that continues onto the finish. Blends good flavors, weight and acidic crispness.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Pungent and sweaty smelling on first blush, almost suggesting Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. It remains oily and nettled on the nose, with sharpness. Sooner rather than later it softens, unveiling flavors of green melon, passionfruit and citrus. And the finish goes out with snap, orange and grapefruit. Potent for the variety.",Spain,Albariño
"A little gritty and tough on the nose, with hard strawberry and kirsch aromas. The palate is voluminous and foamy, with flavors of burnt blood orange and grilled pink grapefruit. Yes, there's a hard, burnt element to the wine, but this being Pinot Noir from Penedès that's to be expected.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Inky, dark and packed with blueberry and boysenberry aromas. This is a ripe, potent Rioja with a strapping feel, concentration, rugged tannins and a mix of herbal blackberry, prune and plum flavors. Shows pencil lead and blackberry on the chunky finish. Drink now through 2016.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stalky aromas of corn, apple and white flowers lack focus. This feels blocky, while salty flavors of cured ham blend with leesy flavors of papaya and peach. A moderate basic finish is par for the course.",Spain,White Blend
"A gaseous smelling nose and a chunky palate are not motivational, while flavors of banana and melon aren't much better. Overall, this is a basic Verdejo that's starting to fade.",Spain,Verdejo
"Offering a flat opening with no kick, it is akin to sniffing apple juice. This is plump and wan in feel, with melon and banana flavors, while a soft, no-edge finish doesn't leave much of a lasting impression.",Spain,Verdejo
"Melon and cidery aromas are distant. This feels low on acidity, while pear, papaya and briny flavors taste bitter on the back end of the palate. A briny, pickled note marks the finish.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Nothing on the bottle says this is oaked, but this Albariño smells like burnt plywood and sawdust. It's chunky and fat on the palate, with woody melony flavors that finish salty and dried out.",Spain,Albariño
"Mature mealy apricot aromas lead to a spent palate with unfocused cidery flavors that taste old and demanding. This finishes heavy, pulpy and without much point or pleasure. Albariño is meant to be fresh and friendly, but this is neither.",Spain,Albariño
"Leesy aromas of tropical fruits feed into a flat palate. Leesy but bland peach and melon flavors lack conviction and finish sketchy, with nothing in particular standing out. This is the definition of a marginal Cava.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Clean, fully loaded blackberry and dark plum aromas are smooth and subtle. In the mouth, this Tempranillo is chunky and solidly built, with earthy, roasted flavors of berry and plum. Savory, meaty flavors define the finish on  this dark-leaning, affordable Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Seems more earthy and damp than you might expect, with minerally notes. Sort of fiery and rugged on the palate, with tough tannins and only modest roundness and richness for a reserva-level wine from a good vintage. Shows some bitter chocolate on the finish. Needs another year in bottle to show better.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Minty black cherry aromas give it a solid opening, but there's also some mild cleanser and paint scents to the nose. The palate is basic, snappy, fresh and carries good weight, while the flavors are sweet, berry-oriented and softened by vanilla. A good Grenache with good balance.",Spain,Garnacha
"Ripe black fruit aromas aren't overly complex or nuanced but they are generous. Feels tight, gritty and healthy, with firm tannins in front of black cherry and blackberry flavors. Mellows on the finish, where plum and prune flavors take over. Not a hard, fierce Priorat; drink now through 2014.",Spain,Red Blend
"Spunky on the nose, with sweetness defined by animal cracker cookies, vanilla wafer, leather and candied berry fruit. Feels tight and slightly acidic, with herbal berry, tobacco and chocolate flavors. Solid and grabby late, with lasting tang from the acidity.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This single-vineyard beauty continues its run of excellence. The '07 is dense, toasty and powerful, with bacon, vanilla, cigar box and wild berry aromas that set up a strong-boned, fully structured palate overflowing with dark cherry, boysenberry, tobacco and sweet vanilla flavors. Needs time; drink from 2012 through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aurus defines awesome modern Rioja. The nose is floral and decked out with wild berry aromas, marzipan, vanilla and hard spices. The palate is powerful and tannic, with bold cassis, raspberry, cherry, coffee and chocolate flavors. Beautifully crafted and with a nice red fruit element courtesy of 15% Graciano to go with old vines Tempranillo. Drink from 2012–2021.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Melon, apple and peach pit aromas are dusty but that's about it. This feels flat, with little acidity or kick. Flavors of peach and apple cider end similarly, with no vitality to the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Aromas of canned peas and beans indicate this was probably fresher smelling nine months ago. Zesty and solid on the palate, this tastes oily, pyrazinic and briny, with stone fruit notes.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Extreme raisiny aromas are suggestive of P.X. Sherry. This is heavy and grabby on the palate while prune and raisin flavors are dominant. On the finish, this is overripe and ponderous, with fig and prune flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Murky mucky passion fruit and pineapple aromas are uncommon and uninviting. This feels watery and a bit citrusy, while strained mango and passion fruit flavors end bitter, pithy and lean.",Spain,Albariño
"Stalky and foul on the nose, this Chardonnay doesn't smell inviting. Oily and heavy on the palate, this tastes of resiny oak, related cream and bland white fruits.",Spain,Chardonnay
"This straightforward, perfectly clean blend of Carignan, Syrah and Garnacha would function as a great everyday house red. It's lively and a little racy and grating on the palate, with standard, fresh berry flavors touched up by a sprinkle of chocolaty oak. A modest finish keeps the vibe positive.",Spain,Red Blend
"Ripe and sweet, with lush, raisiny aromas. The palate is flush, deep and layered, with baked berry, prune, toast and coffee flavors. This is a lot like Vall Llach's signature '07, but it's a bit more restrained and at $50 it's a better deal than the $95 wine. Still, it's a heavyweight to drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"Young and round on the nose, with black cherry, blackberry and dry spice aromas. Gets deeper and more exotic as it breathes, with ripe, full tannins and nice flavors of sweet berry fruit, black cherry, vanilla, fig and chocolate. Meaty and round on the finish; drink now through 2014.",Spain,Red Blend
"Opens with sweet fruit aromas, a whiff of oak and red candy, while the mouthfeeel is juicy and mostly fresh, with clean fruit flavors and more than adequate ripeness and sweetness. Fresh, composed and pleasant in the scheme of things.",Spain,Red Blend
"Reddish in color, with solid aromas of tire rubber, cherry and plum. The palate shows fine lift and balance, and the flavors of juicy, slightly pithy and bitter raspberry and plum are just right for Navarran Garnacha-based rosé. Drink soon with salads and finger foods.",Spain,Rosé
"Crisp, natural and lightly salinic on the nose, with medium weight, good freshness and solid peach and citrus flavors. This is a standard but nicely done Rioja rosé with a pithy finish and just the right edge to it. Drink liberally with appetizers and you shouldn't go wrong.",Spain,Rosé
"More basic and strained than prior wines from this producer. The nose is rubbery and cheesy at first, with leather and blackberry. Hard, tannic and acidic as well, and only a little softer with airing. Flavors are of snappy, tough cherry and berry, and the finish shows tannic bite. Could improve some with aging; now it's a tough go.",Spain,Grenache
"Kicks off with minty coconut aromas and prune, then a hint of creamy green. The palate shows proper acidity and tannin balance, so the framing for the wine's raspberry flavors is good. Grabby but fresh on the finish, with just enough grapey richness.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is a great wine, from a vintage that wasn't great. The nose is smooth and rich, with raspberry, plum, fine oak and all the spice that comes with it. The palate feels fresh and healthy, with racy blackberry fruit tempered by creamy chocolate, vanilla and spice. Like most high-end wines from the Eguren family, this is right on the money. Drink now through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Reduced medicinal raspberry and cherry aromas are more like fruit juice than wine. This is choppy and off the mark in mouthfeel, while unfamiliar jumbled flavors of jammy red berry fruits finish tannic and green.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is an underripe stench bomb with pyrazines coming at you from every direction. The nose is like a bowl of cactus and nettle, while the palate is harsh. Flavors of bitter pithy grapefruit show all that can go wrong with this variety.",Spain,Verdejo
"Strange yeasty unfocused aromas are unclean. This is flat and spineless, with yeasty papaya flavors. A diluted, leesy finish confirms that it's not ready for prime time.",Spain,Chardonnay
"This is a heartbeat or two from being DOA. Tan in color with an oily heavy mouthfeel, this tastes oxidized and shows almost no pulse.",Spain,Verdejo
"With full-force aromas of leather, blackberry and licorice, this Levante blend is an aggressive wine with a tight, acidic body and racy flavors of cherry and tart plum. It's forward and pushy, with rawness, plenty of acidity on the finish, and flavors that take on a dark character.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is a big, modern, warm Garnacha with a lot of oak and vanilla on the bouquet as well as blackberry and cassis. It's jammy on the tongue, but there's enough acidity to keep the pulse up. Dark black cherry, berry and rubbery flavors are followed by end-notes of raisin, chocolate and vanilla.",Spain,Garnacha
"The bouquet on this Priorat is raisiny, with tobacco and schisty aromas. The palate is one part jumpy and another part stewy and clumsy, with baked berry flavors that come with a tangy citric edge. The finish is long, with tobacco, stewed fruit and hard tannins. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Red Blend
"It has taken a few years but Morlanda has reached a nice place with this wine. Look for ripeness and concentrated black fruit aromas, and then a ripe palate with herbal blackberry and chocolate. Smooth on the finish, with a tiny bit of burn. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Red Blend
"Grapey and potent as Rioja crianzas go, with a medium-to-full-sized palate that's full of bright acidity and standard but solid berry fruit flavors. It's the slightest bit creamy and thick on the finish, but overall it's about as middle of the road as any wine on the market.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Very light in body, color and aromas. The nose is punchy and a bit sharp, and so is the palate, which offers crisp, bracing acids to highlight zesty, lean nectarine and tangerine flavors. Quite linear and citric, but experience with this wine says it shows best with food.",Spain,Rosé
"Soda pop-like on the nose, with a clear reference to Sprite and 7Up. The palate is somewhat candied and simple, but it has good feel and the flavors of lemon-lime are likable. Mild on the finish, with flavors that extend from the lemon-lime bouquet and palate.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A chunky wine with compost, coffee and leather on the nose. The palate holds onto that chunkiness with clumsy flatness that goes with herbal plum and berry flavors. Airing allows it to unfold and find a better place, but always does it seem heavy and on the murky side.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The opening of smoke, rubber and black cherry comes across as being dark and good. The palate holds form with lively cherry, plum and currant flavors and finally a medium-long, somewhat warm and meaty finish. Good for an everyday, no-frills Garnacha.",Spain,Grenache
"Starts out muddled and murky, and eventually settles on rich, raisiny and slightly stewed. Seeing that this is Toro, some overripeness is almost a given, and thus the black fruit and licorice flavors are expected. Finishes warm, toasty and short, with a candied hollowness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Piercing to start, with leathery, bacony and campfire aromas. Saturated, although healthy, if a bit hard and tannic. Flavors of bacon and clove are right up there with black fruit and syupy richness, and clove carries onto the finish. Needs time to breathe and unfold; 65% Garnacha and 35% Syrah.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"Opens with bright, popping cherry aromas that are straightforward, much like the rest of the show. The palate is regular and healthy in feel, with standard cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes the slightest bit toasty and warm. Nice but basic Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with smoky, toasty black fruit aromas that send a clear signal that this is prime stuff. The palate has a velvety, lush feel despite having big tannins, and the flavors of blackberry, cassis, fine herbs, coffee and toast scream modern, but in a melodious, clear voice. Long, deep and toasty on the finish. Drink now through 2017.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The Eguren family makes a handful of take-no-prisoners Riojas, and this is probably the best value among them. Earthy and deep; the roasted berry, ham and sweet vanilla aromas lead to a palate that's the picture of health and balance. The fruit character is outstanding as are nuances of tobacco, chocolate and spice. Drink from 2012–2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little more raisiny than expected, but that's offset by a brilliant floral streak and more dominant blackberry, blueberry and black plum flavors. Finishes with a mix of freshness, delicious prune fruit and chocolate. Tasted blind, like we do in almost all cases, this wine was easy to identify as Calvario; it has a uniqueness to its fruit. Drink now through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Scratchy plum and raspberry aromas are fresh and forward, while the mouthfeel follows suit; it's juicy, with narrowing acidity and brightness. Flavors of raspberry, plum and cherry end zesty and long, with crisp acidity maintaining focus. This is a blend of Carignan (Mazuelo), Garnacha and Syrah.",Spain,Red Blend
"With dry, spicy, leafy aromas, this is pure, varietal Maturana, a grape only a handful of Rioja wineries are using. This version is lively, big and spirited, with reedy, leafy, black-fruit flavors and a long, spicy, full-bodied finish.",Spain,Maturana
"With a burnished gold tint, this oak-aged, mature Godello offers dry citrus aromas, hard spice and barrel notes. The palate is structured and holding its own, while oaky, oxidized flavors of orange and peach end with almond, wood resin and mature citrus flavors. Drink this interesting but unusual white now.",Spain,Godello
"The nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray.",Spain,White Blend
"With damp earth and crusty leather aromas, this is a heavy wine with baked fruit, a syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of mocha, carob, leafy berry and earth. On the finish, it's full bodied and soft, with ripe black-fruit flavors that register as thick and a touch raisiny. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dense black plum and berry aromas are earthy, flat and jammy by Calvario standards. Feels chewy and hefty, with grabby, driving tannins and roasted flavors of blackberry, espresso and herbs. Not as complex and interesting compared to great vintages, but still an impressive Rioja cut from a modern cloth. Drink now through 2016.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Husky on the nose but mostly it comes across as wild, with jumpy, loud pear, melon and apple aromas. The mouth is spunky and all over the map, while flavors of tangy yellow fruits carry an acidic, herbal twinge and even a grassy quality. Lacks perfect poise but it can't be called timid or dull.",Spain,Albariño
"A simple but nice style of Ribera wine with open plum and berry aromas as well as snappy, juicy, fresh red fruit flavors. It's a touch biting and zesty at this point, but if you don't mind a little bite and zap it's perfectly good.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Here's another good value red from Borsao. It's about as potent and packed a wine as you'll find for $7, and while it's jumpy, young and aggressive, it's also full of jammy black fruit, sticky extraction and firm tannins. A classic mouthfiller with spunk, color and heft.",Spain,Garnacha
"Ripe apple aromas make the nose nice, even though it's flattening with age. Likewise on the palate, which delivers pithy orange and dry melon flavors along with indications that it's just starting to fade. Notes of green herbs and scallion come up on the finish. Drink this mature white immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"This Garnacha is perfectly good in every way, shape and form. The nose is loaded with bright berry aromas and a hint of mint. The palate feels lively and right, while flavors of raspberry, blackberry and leather lead to a deep, long, slightly hot finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"This small-lot, dry Pedro Ximénez is maderized and oxidized, but also interesting. The nose is waxy and resiny, with dusty peach and apricot aromas. In the mouth, it's complex and mature, however the flavors are bitter and subdued, with corn and wheaty notes. A bready, honeyed finish brings things around. Just 90 cases made.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Mildly earthy, leathery and light in color, with rooty aromas and tree bark on the nose. The palate is good, maybe a bit sharp and angular, with savory flavors of tomato, red plum and earth. Dry on the finish and good for everyday consumption.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Deep and earthy on the nose, with cedar, tobacco and plodding berry aromas. This is more full and thick than light and elegant; the palate is fruity and tannic, with plump plum and dark berry flavors. Chocolaty but monotone on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Warm and powerful stuff, with potent black fruit, latex and oak-driven vanilla aromas. Saturated and jammy, with oaky flavors of hard spice, blackberry, burnt toast and pepper. Feels a little hot and crusty on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Begins with a full blast of toast and char, and then come notes of lemon, leather and rooty, sweet berry fruit. Borderline syrupy in feel, with heavy concentration and baked flavors of molasses and chocolate to go with blackberry. Seems a little over the top and stewy, but there's no doubting its ripe, round character.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Woodsy and rich smelling, with sous-bois, ample spice, ripe berry aromas and weight. It shows texture and grip on the palate, followed by baked, smoky flavors of roasted black fruits and toast. Finishes foresty and warm. Appealing in every way. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rich, smoky and heady, with earthy black fruit aromas that fold in mocha and vanilla. The palate runs fairly crisp and firm for a big wine, with black cherry, spice, peppercorn and herbal flavors. Super lively, tight and showing cola and lemon peel on the woody finish. Drink from 2012–2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is a warm, weighty Tempranillo with earthy, leathery, baked berry aromas. The palate is plump but solid and structured, with ripe, mildly salty tasting berry flavors that finish mossy and mature, with an abundance of oak-based vanilla and earth notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is dark as night, with boysenberry, blackberry, animal fur and smooth oak aromas. For $10, it's bringing all sorts of power and quality, like oak-influenced flavors of vanilla, chocolate, blackberry and cassis. On the finish, this is full and smacks down with tannic grab.",Spain,Red Blend
"This focused, crisp Tempranillo from a nice, warm vintage offers a mix of fresh plum, raspberry, vanilla and spice on the bouquet. It's honest and correct in the mouth, with plum, cherry, dry spice and light oak flavors. A clean, mellow finish is an appropriate ending for this midtier Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of vanilla, stewed red berry, leather, cheese and heat indicate a ripe wine entering it's peak years. This is tannic and grating in the mouth, with syrupy flavors of prune and chocolate. The finish carries a baked character along with flavors of raisin and liqueur. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"This unusual varietal wine hits with a giant wall of herbal aromas that suggest tomato leaf, oregano and basil. The palate is firm and structured in feel, with smacking tannins and flavors of dark berry fruits, green herbs and coffee. A peppery tasting finish with residual green flavors and mocha works for this decidedly herbal-leaning but high-quality wine. Drink now.",Spain,Maturana
"For a higher-priced wine, this has some issues. The nose is heavy and murky, with leathery, baked aromas. In the mouth, it's somewhat choppy and acidic, thus punctuating the cherry tomato portion of the earth-and-leather flavor profile. Lingering oak accents the finish, which is zesty and leans toward sour.",Spain,Garnacha
"Rusty in hue, with mature, slightly old aromas of leather, gym bag, dried leaves and mature berry. The palate has depth and concentration, while the flavors are herbal and run toward baked black cherry and tobacco. Caramel and mature fruit flavors vie for control of the roasted finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"A clean, nice, regular Tempranillo with normal black cherry and berry aromas that offer hints of rubber and bacon. The palate is tannic and grabby but balanced for the most part, with pure, basic blackberry and cherry flavors. Modest in its scope, but fresh and untainted.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Intense up front, with potent black fruit aromas offset by a lactic creaminess. Racy and juicy in the mouth as bright, penetrating blackberry flavors hit hard and then are softened by flavors of chocolate and mocha. Feels a little acidic and strained, but should age nicely for up to five years.",Spain,Red Blend
"A healthy wine with plenty of oak. On the nose, it's charred as well as fruity, with raspberry and plum aromas blending with vanilla. Feels tight and grippy, with dry oak, herbal flavors and fresh red berry and tomato. Finishes clean and snappy, with correct weight and length. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With solid berry and plum aromas, the bouquet is friendly and nice. This is fresh and fruity in style, with hints of leather and chocolate accenting core berry and plum flavors. An earthy, warm finish with leathery notes is the final act.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of pine, rubber and rhubarb are austere, and so is the rest of the wine. The palate is run by acidity, which is sharp and scouring. Flavors are tart and underdone, with pie cherry and red raspberry. Sheering but admittedly cleansing, with surprising sourness.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dusty and with nice apple and spice aromas. The palate, however, is quite flat and devoid of a lively bubble bead. Flavors of pear and melon run sweet, while the finish is dull and lacks effervescence.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Quite an oaky wine, with aromas of BBQ, hickory, roasted plum and spice. The body is full but scratchy, with additional oak manifesting itself in the form of baked, rooty, vanilla flavors that override the wine's simple but quiet fruit content. Finishes dark and toasty, with coffee, mocha and vanilla flavors.",Spain,Red Blend
"For an '04 reserva, this wine is more edgy, grabby and high in acid than expected. The nose shows old world leather, spearmint and smoked meat more than vibrant fruit, yet the palate is tangy, citric and tastes of red raspberry and plum. Slightly more creamy on the finish, but still it remains scratchy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The nose on this regularly solid Verdejo is mild, with aromas of apple, pear and melon. The palate is round and a touch fleshy, with modest acidity pushing pithy peach and pear flavors. The finish tastes of almond skins and apple.",Spain,Verdejo
"Leathery, stalky berry aromas are a bit rustic, and so is the feel. But the flavors on this Cabernet from Cariñena are satisfying and forward, suggesting stewed plum, baked berry and sun-drenched warmth. This is almost cooked but it pulls back. At six years of age it is what it is; drink now.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smoky, rubbery and lightly baked smelling, but also generous and full, with berry and vanilla aromas. Feels full and comfortable, with toast, vanilla, chocolate and core berry and plum flavors. Healthy and well made as a whole; drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Roasted, leathery and sulphuric out of the bottle, but time serves it well and soon herbal notes, tanned saddle and baked berry aromas emerge. Feels a bit sheer and tight, with fiery plum and berry flavors. Grippy on the finish, so it needs time in bottle or plenty of air if you're drinking now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Clean, fruity and snappy, with pointed red fruit aromas and flavors as well as higher than normal acidity. Tastes fresh and forward and entirely straightforward, with a hollow but easy finish and mild but controlled sharpness.",Spain,Grenache
"Almost red in color, with dusty aromas that mix in a blast of latex and dried cherry notes. The wine is made from organically grown Bobal grapes, and it offers tang and bite along with crisp flavors of plum skins, raspberry and citrus. Almost sour, but not. A solid quaffer for the price.",Spain,Rosé
"A standard Riojano red with crisp cherry aromas followed by a zesty, slightly tart palate that carries punchy cherry fruit, acidity and little nuance or character. Tastes a tiny bit sour by today's measurements, but it's still pretty good for being crisp and acid-driven.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Slightly vinegary on the cherry-laden nose, with a mild but persistent briney character. The palate is high in acid, leading to some scour, but the flavors of plum and berry, while generic, are pretty good. Finishes with hints of toast, pepper and spice. Solid enough for $8.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rock solid and dense, with aromas of black cherry and cassis along with a whiff of aged cheese. The palate is tight, tannic and rubbery, with grabby black cherry and blackberry flavors along with toasty, dark shadings. Finishes firm, with a touch of black olive and herbs. The best MC to date; drink now through 2017.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet and fiery on the nose, with piercing aromas that burn right up your nasal passages. The palate is pinched and super tannic, with biting flavors of black licorice, blackberry and cola. Could be better with a softer, smoother mouthfeel but seeing that this is an '04 with six years behind it, it isn't going to soften up much.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells a little too much like berry candy and cough syrup to win you over, and the palate is kind of flat and chunky as well as thick with creamy berry fruit. Points of acidic bite give it life, but things are brought back down on the finish with green, creamy oak notes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Quite candied and jumpy on the nose, what some might call bug juice. Having spent six months in American oak, it's tight and tough on the palate, with fresh, juicy acidity that's a bit scouring. Tastes much like milk chocolate and candied fruit.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Begins with pasty, lactic aromas and heavy fruit. The palate is both big and clumsy, with sharp acidity amid bulk leading to choppy plum and medicinal cherry flavors. A clacky wine with power but not much finesse.",Spain,Garnacha
"Jammy, dark and reduced, with breadth along with leather and compost aromas. The palate is leathery, funky and medicinal, with viscosity and creamy berry flavors. Has richness and body but the flavors and congruety are sketchy until you remember that it costs but $7.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Neon pink in color, with heavier aromas that split time between chemical and candied. The palate is a bit awkward and heavy, with jumbled flavors of pomegranate juice, cherry and strawberry. Loses focus as it moves along, and finishes with a slightly bitter aftertaste.",Spain,Rosé
"Simple at best early on, with leathery, rustic aromas and a truly basic set of flavors. Should you allow it to breathe, it rounds into a good (but still basic), semisoft and fruity red with solid cherry/berry flavors and nothing offputting.",Spain,Red Blend
"An oaky, modern-style wine with a staunch mocha and vanilla influence, but the fruit is ripe and rich enough to handle it. Spicy and grainy on the nose, with vanilla and resin seeping through. The palate remains woody but is full of berry flavors, while the omnipresent barrel influence carries onto the rich, ripe finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stony aromas of green melon and apple are mellow and classy. This is fresh on the palate, with a burst of acidity to brighten things up. Flavors of citrus fruits, green apple, nectarine and stony minerality finish similarly.",Spain,Albariño
"Dusty apple aromas are given lift courtesy of citrus notes. This feels good on the palate, with zesty acidity. Flavors of stone fruits, tropical fruits, apple and citrus meld together well, while the finish is pure and long.",Spain,Albariño
"A very good value-priced Rioja with rubber and hickory on the bouquet along with light touches of cassis and red plum. Feels smart, fresh and lively, with a good blend of tomato, herb and red berry flavors. Finishes spicy and crisp, with an herbal, peppery accent.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Muscular plum and black cherry aromas come with citrus peel and herbal notes. The mouthfeel is stout and healthy, with chewy tannins and lightly baked flavors of sweet blackberry darkened by pepper. Jammy and ripe overall; good Toro for under $20.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Solid up front, with sweet and spicy aromas of plum, vanilla and candied berry. Feels full and good, with weight and thickness boosting up toasty, woody berry flavors. Dries out on the finish, leaving spice and a resiny taste. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly sweet smelling, with butterscotch and salinic notes to the soft, somewhat bland nose. Feels fleshy, with modest acidity and creamy flavors of apple, banana and melon. Mellow late, with a creamy, vanilla-tinged finish. Viura and Malvasia.",Spain,White Blend
"Neon purple in color, young and jumpy, but hey, that's what simple Garnacha from this part of Spain is all about. Expect fruity, jammy aromas and a blazing, full-fruited palate of rubber, black fruits and bacon. It's grapey but honest, and for the price it's as expected.",Spain,Garnacha
"Aromas of chocolate mint, creamy vanilla and candy reflect a heavy-handed oak treatment, and a sweet burnt cherry and chocolate mint character is present throughout. Creamy on the tongue, but confected in terms of flavors and finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Somewhat stewy and leathery for starters, with a thick, creamy palate that shows stemmy, roasted plum and berry flavors. The feel is solid and thick, but the flavors don't really come around and settle.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fairly light and leathery, with strained aromas of animal hide and burnt berry fruit. The palate feel is light to medium, with scratchiness, and the flavors are of roasted fruit, leather and dryness. Spice and a slight bitterness define the finish. Has a few issues but still a good wine for $10.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Palacio Quemado, which means the Burnt Palace, is a funky wine from Extremadura that mixes forceful floral aromas with barnyard and grape juice scents. It's a fuller-bodied, grabby wine with chunky, medicinal flavors and a finish that meanders before settling on big and herbal. Has its good points and weaknesses.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet smelling, with a touch of pastry. Focused, lean and nice in the mouth, showing dry apple and citrus peel flavors. Solid Cava that brings a modicum of leesy, pithy richness on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Jumps out of the chute with baked, earthy, funky aromas that are more savory and spicy than outright fruity. The palate has a good but limited mouthfeel, while the flavors of raspberry are spicy and saucy. Good in a subtle, earthy, nonfruity way.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark purple in color, with a jammy nose of berry fruit and coconut. The palate is concentrated, a little narrow and sharp in the center, with snappy, pointed cherry and berry flavors. Fruity but sheer wine, with dashes of nutmeg and cocoa powder on the finish.",Spain,Tinta Fina
"Comes across a bit baked, syrupy and sweet on the nose, with a hint of stalkiness and stem. The palate has a lush early feel, but further inspection unveils a hollow core. Flavors veer toward earthy raspberry, while the finish is chunky and properly reflects what came before it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts with tough, almost harsh green aromas on the nose, but with time it settles on herbs and tobacco. The palate is fresh but a touch spiky and grabby, with herbal plum and berry flavors. Solid mouthfeel and length make it worthwhile even if it's herbal and slightly green tasting.",Spain,Garnacha
"Opens with vinaigrette and balsamic notes along with leather and black fruit aromas. The palate is soft and muddled, with soupy, stewy flavors and a jagged, candied finish. Seems to struggle for balance, which is a common flaw in many Toro wines.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Sweet, plummy and unrefined on both the nose and palate. This is nothing more than simple juice that isn't terrible. It's grapey, sweet and tart, with an edgy bit of tang to the finish. Regular at best; subpar if you're being critical.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy aromas mix with grassy green notes in front of a sweet, chunky palate that offers unconvincing, generic berry flavors. Devoid of elegance and character but loaded with heft and baked fruit. A sweet, rudimentary wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Balsamic and hard, with a briney, stemmy set of chemical-tinged black fruit aromas. The palate hits with force and noise; it's hard, tannic and unforgiving. The flavors of baked berry are rich, but the finish is grating and blazes with tannic burn.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Smells a bit foxy and gangly at first, with jumpy, almost sweaty aromas matching candied cassis and raisiny notes. After it settles down things feel drawn and firm, with baked berry, licorice and other dark flavors. Finishes sweet, with a dusting of cocoa.",Spain,Red Blend
"Salinic, crisp and peachy on the nose, with easy, ripe melon aromas to sweeten it up. Shows good body and spritz alongside tropical flavors of orange and melon. Finishes with weight before rolling away with elegance. Punchy and ready to go.",Spain,Albariño
"A little scratchy on the nose, but otherwise it exudes pure aromas of cassis and raspberry. The palate is juicy, racy and snappy but full and structured, while the flavors of raspberry, plum and blackberry get sweetness in the form of coconut and vanilla-infused coffee. Less soft and bodied than previous vintages but a big winner nonetheless.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Coconut and vanilla aromas ride front and center on the oaky nose, although berry fruit rises up with time. The palate is bulky and saturated, almost what you'd call thick, while the flavors lean toward roasted berry, plum and woodspice. Vanilla and additional wood accents work the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Round and generally attractive, with raisiny richness that emerges with airing. The palate is more snappy and acidic than the nose might suggest, with herbal raspberry flavors. That same acidity lifts the finish, and overall the wine is fresh, racy and not that complex.",Spain,Tempranillo
"From Viña Mayor, this French-oak-aged wine is composed and dry, with good plum and berry aromas that bring balanced oak as well. The palate sports proper weight and balance, solid berry and plum flavors, and a warm, minty finish. Not mind blowing but good for a weak vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bright and aggressive for Llopart, with lively orange and apricot aromas. Frothy to the point of being bubbly, with ripe, bouncy pink grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Stays racy and citrusy on the finish. All fruit; not complex.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Strawberry and raspberry aromas come on with aggression, and the bouquet doesn't really evolve. The palate is crisp, snappy and high in acid, with grating red cherry and red plum flavors. Decent red fruit character throughout but not much feel or depth.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mint, carob and green-tinged fruit aromas precede an herbal-tasting palate with olive-influenced plum, berry and cola flavors. From down south in Spain, it shows pretty good body and an okay mouthfeel, but the flavor profile is a little funky and strange.",Spain,Garnacha
"An elegant and well-made Albariño with lemon chiffon, pear and green apple aromas. The palate is just right in feel, depth and minerality, with apple, pear, honeydew and hidden spice flavors. Clean, teetering on lush and delicious as it finishes. Drink this pretty wine as soon as possible.",Spain,Albariño
"Slightly more leafy, herbal and burnt on the nose than ideal, but there's also tobacco, cherry and earth notes to keep it proper. The palate is smooth in feel, with good depth, while the flavor profile has a salty side as well as black cherry and molasses. Good wine with a few issues.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raisiny, sweet and baked, with plenty of oak coming on as it airs out. This vintage is somewhat syrupy and strained compared to prior years, with baked black fruit flavors. Seems a little reduced on the finish, but overall it's still good given this winery's strong track record and how the wine compares to other 2007 Riojas.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Solid, big and fruity, which is basically what a Campo de Borja Garnacha should be. Sweet red fruits and robust kick define the palate, which is tannic but not obtrusively so. Zesty and a bit of a one-noter, but a nice one. Garnacha with 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dry, dusty and minty on the nose, with cherry, cedar and sweet oak notes. The palate has a hard, clangy bite to it, while the flavors run toward herbal cherry and dried tobacco. Some vanilla and cola along the way bring up the pleasure quotient. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with peach and apple aromas that are 100% normal, while the palate has a chiseled clarity to it that's crisp and appreciated. A flavor profile of dry apple, citrus and dusty spice is good, and the finish is fresh and lemony. Drink right away.",Spain,Albariño
"Earthy berry aromas convey quality, and there's oak, floral aromas and tobacco notes for support. Feels dry and tight, with lightly herbal, lightly burnt flavors of plum, berry, tomato and toasted oak. Finishes dry and herbal.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts out with scratchy, edgy aromas of dried fruits, orange peel and tobacco. It's fairly light in concentration and weight, with woodsy, spicy flavors of vanilla, oak and foresty fruit. Above average but resides in that upper-middle tier.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells fairly burnt and dull, with earthy, stemmy aromas that are strained and tough. The palate reflects the nose with heavy, roasted, leathery plum flavors that finish with a meaty thud. Rustic and stemmy, with a low pulse.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Jammy and flat smelling, with little to no depth to the nose. The palate is snappy but there's just enough body to offset the acidity, while the flavors of red fruits are tart and regular. Dull tasting, with a fairly long finish that's unexciting.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A green, struggling wine from front to back. The nose kicks up underripe aromas to go with distant red fruit, while the palate is edgy and prickly, with high acidity creating snappy cherry and green flavors.",Spain,Garnacha
"Fairly generous for a bargain-priced, everyday Rioja. There's bacon, rubber, leather and mild oak on the fruity bouquet, while the palate is concentrated, jumpy and hosts honest red berry fruit flavors along with dry oak and a spot of vanilla. Meets any reasonable expectation of what $12 Rioja should be.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice for a standard, no-frills type of Rioja. The cherry and raspberry aromas are sweet and clean, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of ripe cherry, berry, vanilla and cream. Offers good clarity, power and depth given its price point.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly dry and leafy on the nose, but with beef jerky, cola and mild raisin aromas. The palate is forward, with controlled heat and tannin along with cola, berry and mushroom flavors. Honest in a traditional way, with a long finish that shows a touch of sweet brown sugar. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard, pickled aromas settle on leathery and burnt after airing. The palate is jammy and sticky, with sweet, heavy, roasted, burnt-tasting black fruit flavors. Resiny as well. Tempranillo with 10% Syrah.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe, dense and powerful, with on onslaught of raisin, spice, pepper and leather on the nose. The palate is direct and pure, with clean flavors of berry, spice and chocolate leading to a long, layered finish. Beautiful wine; one of the best I've had from this region. 70% Monastrell with 20% Cabernet and 10% Syrah.",Spain,Red Blend
"A loud, fiery nose indicates that this wine has a lot in store. Aromas of brick dust, earth, tobacco and red pepper flake set up a choppy, tannic, lively palate with a full dosage of cherry, plum, spice and toast flavors. Roasted on the finish but still fresh. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A barrel-aged surprise. The nose is round and toasty but not overwooded. The palate is balanced and elegant, with full, round, integrated flavors of dry apple, cream and spice. Has the right texture to be considered elevated and classy; 70% Treixadura with five other white grapes.",Spain,White Blend
"Opens with unique, abnormal aromas of spiced fruit, cardamom and nutmeg. The palate is thick along the edges but lacks body in the middle, while flavors of red berry fruit are chunky, mildly stewy and roasted. Earthy and funky wine, but with good feel and overall good character.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not even El Bosque could escape the difficulties of the cool, extended 2007 vintage. While typically dark and bulky on the nose, it's also dull by Bosque standards, with oaky mocha and coffee stepping in as filler. The body is drawn and tannic, with oak, resin and dark berry flavors. Finishes resiny as well. By no means bad, but given Bosque's precedent it's not stellar.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mature smelling, with citrus peel, tobacco and molasses on the nose. The palate is a bit lean and acidic 10 years after harvest, with little expansiveness and driving, citrusy flavors of raspberry and red plum. Juicy but clampy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with orange peel aromas. This wine from the Pansa Blanca grape is balanced and easygoing, with sweet but friendly flavors of citrus, melon and mango. Mild and controlled from front to back. Drink well chilled.",Spain,Pansa Blanca
"Dusty plum and black cherry aromas feature a touch of dry oak. Tight, snappy and properly tannic in the mouth, with full berry, baked plum and background spice flavors. Finishes with control and power; good red wine for the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Piercing on the nose, with hickory smoke, char and exotic boysenberry aromas. Feels high in acid and low in density, with a tight and biting mouthfeel along with heavily oaked flavors of berry fruit, vanilla, butter and coconut. Very fresh and colorful, but lacking in stuffing and complexity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Jammy smelling but also lean and minty. The palate is almost sour, a bit better later on, but never does it rise above tight, lean and tart. Mesache means youthful but youth is wasted on the young in this case. Garnacha, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and the indigenous Parraleta.",Spain,Red Blend
"For an old wine from a weak vintage, this has its positives. For starters, the nose offers a nice mix of dried fruit, tobacco, cedar and fig paste, while the palate is properly acidic and tastes of red plum, raspberry and oak-driven vanilla. At its drinking peak now; with preserved juiciness and lots of kick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nothing over the top but well made and clean, with red fruit aromas that don't overpower. Flavors of peppy plum and berry flavors come across bright and zesty. A comfortable everyday red with with good follow-through and no off aromas, flavors or textures.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mildly rubbery but full on the nose, with leafy accents and raspberry aromas. Feels full, round and dense, with roasted berry and distant spice on the flavor profile. More straightforward than fancy, with good overall feel, flavor and balance.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lower in price than Cenit's Old Vines, but to me this is a better, more open wine with bacon, spice and bold black-fruit aromas. The palate is full but retains finesse as well as big tannins; flavors of black fruits come with chocolate, coffee and spice. Full-force stuff but still fairly refined. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark, condensed and inky, with big, muscular aromas of charcoal, cassis liqueur, blackberry and tar. The palate is just lush enough despite being staunch and tannic, and the flavors of black fruit and cassis are luscious and sweet, with a bit of lemony oak adding zest. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Dry, spicy and earthy on the nose, with Boston baked bean aromas and candied berry fruit notes. The palate has good spunk and life to it, while the flavors of berry fruit are controlled and modest but heavily spiced. Finishes with cinnamon, nutmeg and fruit cake notes along with a final wave of balancing acidity. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark as night, with prune and rubber on the nose along with murk and compost. It's extracted to the max, leaving a rubbery feel to go with supercharged boysenberry flavors. Gritty and forceful on the finish, and pushing tons of runaway flavor. Not for those who like restrained red wines.",Spain,Mencía
"An assault of oak, vanilla and cigar box is the opening salvo, while wave two and three bring raisiny aromas and finally lemon peel. Chunky and tough in the mouth, with vanilla and resin running ahead of acidic raspberry fruit. Finishes with a mix of sauciness, tang, wood notes and candy.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Oak is apparent on the front end, where milk chocolate and vanilla aromas vie with red berry scents. Feels full and forward, with standard, appealing berry fruit and cassis-like flavors. Toasty and a touch bitter on what amounts to a solid finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Red fruit aromas are matched by mild wood spice and rubber in front of a crisp, solid palate that's tasting spicy, peppery and dry, with red fruit flavors taking over after the spice subsides. Smoky, dry and plummy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Citrus and apple aromas are straightforward. This feels mostly good on the palate, with some flab and grab. Citric-leaning flavors of grapefruit and orange are softened by nectarine notes, while the finish is clampy like the palate.",Spain,Albariño
"Apple and nectarine aromas are clean and snappy, with a hint of yeast-based vanilla. A fresh, citric palate delivers lime, green apple, pineapple and nectarine flavors, while the finish is clean as a new razor, with nothing off, bitter or pithy.",Spain,Verdejo
"Golden brown in color, with smooth, almondy aromas along with apricot, cinnamon and toffee. The palate is full, round, smooth and satisfying, with a fine blend of weight, acidity and prime Sherry flavors. Overall this is a rich, heady style of dry Amontillado that finishes long and secure.",Spain,Sherry
"Mature, classy and different than most, with earth, tobacco, warm fruit, baked notes and subtlety to the bouquet. The palate is whole, welcoming and full of baked plum, spice, molasses and leathery, and then it finish long and complex, but a little sweet and rooty. A winner from Mallorca for those seeking something different. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fresh, dry and elevated by any conventional cava standards. The nose breathes lime, green apple and spice notes, while the palate is crisp, peppery and lightly toasted. Apple and controlled citrus are the fruit components, and then a light yeasty character arises on the finish. A pretty, feminine brut nature to drink now and over the next few years.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fleshy and rich, with a clear reflection of barrel fermentation on the nose, palate and finish. This is plump Verdejo with match stick and toasty vanilla on the bouquet. It's full, round and toasted in the mouth, with spiced apple and vanilla flavors. Oaky and mature; drink this Spanish ode to Burgundy now.",Spain,Verdejo
"Starts out with dark berry aromas and then slips upon airing as roasted, leafy, leathery notes take over. Sports a clacky feel and zingy acidity along with a quick wash of red fruit flavors, herbs and heat. Finishes herbal and slightly leafy, with vanilla sweetness.",Spain,Red Blend
"Light, minerally and fresh smelling, with a note of lime and cured ham. Feels and tastes like pure citrus, with hits of pear, honeydew and ripe apple poking through. Juicy and fresh stuff.",Spain,Verdejo
"Meaty, spicy and smooth on the nose, with subtle dryness that indicates maturity. The palate is saturated but not heavy or chewy, with body and balance that highlights plum, berry, cherry and toasty oak and spice flavors. Shows freshness, health, quality and finesse. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice and bronze, with nutty, potent aromas that are forward and chiseled. Lively, clipped and zesty in the mouth, with nutty pecan, toasted almonds, lemon zest and length. A powerful Sherry that represents the Palo Cortado category with aplomb.",Spain,Sherry
"Starts out with gentle matchstick aromas, but with time it's all about white fruits, green herbs and apple. The palate has a firm, standard, high-quality mouthfeel along with tart apple, white peach and pineapple flavors. The finish is pure lime and snap, while the refreshment quotient runs long and strong.",Spain,Albariño
"Simple, fruity Rioja with mildly candied red berry aromas that turn sweeter and more syrupy with airing. The palate is all zing and zap, with jumpy, mid-weight red berry and herbal flavors. Ditto on the finish, which has a peppery quality.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With dusty apple cider aromas and tingling acidity, this seems a lot like Galician Albariño even though it's from Costers del Segre in Catalonia. Given its price, it boasts solid if pithy apple and gooseberry flavors, modest elegance and only a touch of bitterness on a green fruit finish. Drink soon.",Spain,Albariño
"Nice, simple and fruity, with nothing but standard raspberry fruit and good mouthfeel up its sleeve. The palate is narrow and juicy, while the flavor profile rests on one level: raspberry. Clean and quick on the finish. Perfectly respectable for a $10 Ribera wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts with hard aromas akin to nail polish and rubber gloves. More typical and fruity in the mouth, but it remains kind of lean despite being expansive in the mouth. Tastes like raspberry, with some candy. Gets better as it airs out.",Spain,Grenache
"Generic berry and plum aromas come with sweet vanilla notes and a briney pinch. The wine feels fresh but clacky, with juicy acids giving drive to standard dark cherry and berry flavors. Peppery and lightly oaked on the finish.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Stocky, dark and pure, with inky aromas of shoe polish, black fruits and charcoal. The palate is brawny and tannic, with saturated blackberry, espresso and bitter chocolate flavors. It's rowdy but also attractive and full of everything good including chocolate, spice and pepper on the finish. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Minerally lime and peach-pit aromas set up a crisp, stony, elegant palate with lees-based flavors of vanilla that are softly matched by melon and papaya. Fresh and not too demanding, it's made from 70% Garnatxa Blanca and 30% Macabeo (Viura).",Spain,White Blend
"Shows some meat and heft on the nose along with leather, rubber and black fruit. Solid and generic across the palate, with black cherry and berry flavors that are good and steady. Finishes slightly short and bitter, but overall it's a good wine for basic drinking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with earthy, slightly raisiny aromas along with mint, fresh grass and clay. The palate feels clanky and tannic, while the flavors of strawberry and herbal raspberry are good but bland. Shows its share of good components, but overall the wine struggles to distinguish itself among Rioja's top performers.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dry and mildly herbal on the nose, with an aromatic base of raspberry and cherry. At 60% Garnacha and 40% Carignan, this is a standard Priorat blend with good intensity and a slightly reduced mouthfeel. Flavors of baked berry fruit are regular, while chocolaty warmth, fig paste and molasses work the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Full, savory and beefy on the nose, with a snappy, juicy palate that's flavorful and offers pretty good feel. Size is no issue with this wine, which gives you all the basics of red wine while never once hinting at being more than it is.",Spain,Garnacha
"A touch minty and dry smelling, with simple, solid, slightly underdeveloped flavors. All in all, it's hard to find much brightness in this wine; instead it's subdued and chocolaty, and it never really crosses the Rubicon of ripeness. That said, it goes down easy and doesn't burn like many Toro wines.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Roasted plum and raspberry aromas offer accents of vanilla, dill and dry wood. The palate is big, a little soft and chubby in the middle, with savory, herbal black fruit flavors that are meaty and deep. Finishes earthy, herbal and with integrity. This is Monastrell that's ready to go.",Spain,Red Blend
"A little earthy and rough at first, with rubbery aromas. After time it evolves to deliver a weighty palate full of black fruit, oak and medicinality. Dry, toasty and a bit hot and scratchy on the finish. Nice for $11 Ribera del Duero.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Scratchy and a little sharp smelling on first impression, with vanilla and milk chocolate aromas in addition to standard red fruit scents. Feels firm, solid and basic, with dark fruit flavors touched up by young, simple oak notes. Standard and dry on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Generic and rose-like on the nose, with a hint of raspberry. The mouthfeel is pure, fresh and easy, with proper acidity pushing raspberry, plum and buttery oak flavor. Feels juicy and scouring on the finish, with length and freshness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Warm and smooth, with aromas of fresh dill, spiced cherries, mulled earth and more. The palate has a full, stacked feel with well-oaked flavors of vanilla, toffee and earthy berries. Finishes chewy, with complexity and light flavors of caramel and tobacco. Ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"Super smooth and complete on the nose, with black fruit, toasty oak and earth notes rolled into a nice whole. It's lush, plump and balanced, with full blackberry, raisin, chocolate and spice flavors resting in front of a mellow, spicy finish. A pretty, balanced blend of 75% Tempranillo and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon that shows Jumilla at its best.",Spain,Red Blend
"Some Barbier wines, depending on when you catch them, are fresh, pleasant and overdeliver. Others are dull and dead. This one falls into the first category with its melon, apple and Asian pear aromas and flavors. It's lithe, light in body and clean. Good as it gets for $6.",Spain,White Blend
"This seems like the best bet among the Tempra Tantrum lineup. The nose has vibrancy and good fruit content, while the palate is sizable and shows solid balance. Flavors of cherry and red plum are good, and the finish has some length.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Applesauce aromas are open and inoffensive, and the palate is wet and refreshing, with crisp, dry green apple and generic white fruit flavors. As a brut nature, it makes sense that the finish would be wet, lean and taste like lime-infused soda water.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Light raspberry and plum aromas feature a side note of citrus peel, while the flavors are pure but rudimentary dark berry, plum and herb. Good body and structure, but not complex or layered. Finishes peppery and a touch bitter, with short-lasting fruit.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Emilio Moro's first foray into the land of value-priced wine is good but nothing special. The nose is brambly and dusty, like the inside of a Topps baseball card package. Meanwhile, the palate is tight and lean, with cherry flavors infiltrated by dry oak. Overall it's typical of a solid but average red wine.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Condensed, syrupy cherry aromas are a little candied, while the palate is acidic and angular, with juicy, tomatoey cherry and plum flavors. Fairly tight and lean in the mouth, with just enough oak to create a mocha/cocoa accent on the finish. For the price, there isn't much body, variety of flavor or pleasantries.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A mildly baked wine with a touch of raisin, brine and stem on the nose. The palate is grabby, with firm tannins and core flavors of cherry, blackberry and dry oak. Beyond that, there isn't a whole lot else on offer, and the fruit breaks up on the transition from palate to finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Strawberry and raspberry aromas are a little stalky and stemmy, while the palate is entirely regular in feel, weight and flavor. Speaking of flavors, things run a little tart and herbal, while the finish has an acidic yet fresh zestiness. Midlevel in every way.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stony, minerally aromas are a touch dusty and suggest melon and peach. The palate is round and juicy, while flavors of lime, green melon and gooseberry finish mellow and easy, with a touch of residual citric acid.",Spain,Verdejo
"Friendly aromas of apple and stone fruits are inviting and clean. This is cutting on the palate, but not overly so, with a good feel and cleansing acids. Apple and lime flavors finish bright and uncomplicated.",Spain,Verdejo
"Creamy and minty on the nose, with dark berry aromas that veer toward raisiny. The palate is generous, full, reduced and narrow, with raisin, blackberry and heavy spice flavors. An old-vines style of Monastrell that lumbers across the finish line with full ripeness and sweetness. Drink now.",Spain,Monastrell
"Fresh and easy to like. Smells clean and open, with peach and other white fruit aromas. You name the white or citrus fruit, and it's here: pineapple, grapefruit, mango and lime. Hits both the sweet and citrusy bases.",Spain,Albariño
"Aromas of pencil lead, rubber and spice accent distant red fruit notes. The palate is none too deep, with dilution and bracing acidity. Tastes perky and lightly leafy, with cherry, raspberry, dry spice and finally buttery oak. Whispy but hollow for an '06 reserva.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Red fruit, cassis and sweet rubbery notes define the ripe bouquet. Feels medium to full in size, with leafy flavors mixed with plum, vanilla and oak. Red fruits including strawberry and raspberry work the mildly oaky finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Baked and earthy on the opening, with meaty, spiced aromas that settle on roasted and heavy. Feels mostly healthy, with vanilla and dill flavors leading the way for roasted berry and oak spice. Finishes juicy but drawn down.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smoky and spicy on the nose, with lightly raisined berry fruit aromas. Feels compact and solid, with plum, prune, chocolate and toasty flavors, and just enough acidity to maintain balance and length on the finish. Good Rioja for $10.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean, minerally, slightly green in aromatics and oh so approachable and nice. For an under-$15 white, this Godello from Monterrei excels with layered flavors of apple, minerals and natural spice. The finish is long and hints at fresh herbs like thyme and tarragon. Potentially superb with garlic shrimp or calamari over fresh greens.",Spain,Godello
"Rooty, warm and leathery at first, and then it really rounds into form. This Garnacha-led multigrape blend is a pretty, earthy, stylish wine that's at peak maturity. It brings baked, rich black cherry, cola and toffee flavors and then a finish of coffee and toast. A bit syrupy but still excellent and ready now.",Spain,Red Blend
"White pear, melon and almond skin aromas are good and correct, while the peachy palate has roundness and interesting flavors of orange, lime and nectarine. Crisp, precise and well-glued together, with harmony throughout. A textbook food-friendly white that's more interesting than other Rías Baixas wines due to the addition of Loureira and Caiño Blanco to traditional Albariño.",Spain,White Blend
"Roasted and baked on first blush, but then the wine's complexity and use of unusual Mallorcan grape varieties take over. Along the way there's flavors and aromas of prune, earth, leather, spice and Mediterranean terroir. It's also bringing tobacco and leaf notes to the table. A fun, different wine that goes nicely with tapas. Drink now through 2011–12.",Spain,Red Blend
"The name means “Sea of Vines,” and that's what you see in Rías Baixas. Here, we have a dry, crisp white with apple and apricot on the nose and a bit of roundness, weight and chunkiness in the mouth. Tastes of pithy apple and apricot, with mild bitterness on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Dry and not all that fruity up front, with a blast of oak. The palate shows weight and bold acidity, which pumps up the lemon, apple and pineapple flavors. A bit sour, scouring and sharp, but also cleansing and fresh. Blunt white wine.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc-Verdejo
"Dark in color, with aromas of bacon fat, blackberry candy and vanilla. The body is medium to full, with grabby tannins that support mildly medicinal blackberry and cherry flavors. Finishes clean and regular, with no nasty residue or forced oak.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"A tutti-frutti nose leans toward candied cherry and red plum, while the palate is lean, a touch shrill and tastes of lightly herbal red fruits. Nothing heavy or weighty here; it's a simple, perfectly good everyday Rioja with a hint of oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A rough, raw wine from Galicia that starts with a swirl of hard fruit aromas, heat and chemical. The palate is jacked up with berry fruit, tannic bite and power, and the finish is chewy and rugged. Packed with color and flavor but also aggression. Definitely not for everyone.",Spain,Red Blend
"Neutral, clean, good white wine for the money. The nose features green apple and lemon, and the low-octane body shows brine, citrus fruit flavors and pithy notes. White grapefruit and orange flavors carry the simple finish to a good ending.",Spain,Macabeo-Moscatel
"Light, simple and ready to drink. More acidic than some, with a cleansing, almost sour flavor package of green apple and lemon. Shows a lot of unabsorbed acidity on the finish, which forces the wine toward being crisp and minimalist. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Earthy, baked, raisiny aromas convey ripeness and sweetness. The palate is medium in body and intensity, with juicy acidity propping up lightly leafy and herbal berry and plum flavors. Has good length and feel, with tomato and herbs on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pure and forward, with minerally aromas of citrus, grapefruit and wet stone. For basic Verdejo, this is head and shoulders above most; it bursts with fresh orange, grapefruit, green apple and peach, and the finish is pure and long. So tasty and super easy to like; a highly recommended go-to value white.",Spain,Verdejo
"Peach, melon, apple and minerally aromas are easy to like. This has a standard Rías Baixas feel and moderate citric acidity. Flavors of melon and nectarine finish nice and a bit sweet. Call this textbook Albariño and enjoy it.",Spain,Albariño
"A barrel-heavy blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo? That's what this is, so expect popcorn and bland white fruit along with plenty of acidity. On one hand, it's an angular, sour wine that makes you wonder; on the other hand, it blends toast, butter, baked apple and lemon into a nutty whole that's not bad. Has both merits and faults.",Spain,Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc
"Light, floral and almondy, with hints of pear, apple and buttercup on the nose. More creamy and soft than acidic, with pear and vanilla flavors. The finish holds steady for a while, and overall the wine is likable. 75% Viura and 25% Chardonnay.",Spain,White Blend
"Dark, fiery, forceful and woody, with aromas of sawdust atop black fruit. The palate is zesty, lively and hard, with biting tannins raising up flavors of blackberry and pepper. Acidic, rough and tough, but with good flavors and a decent amount of integrity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rubber and bacon aromas announce that this wine has some size, depth and concentration along with oak shadings, while the palate is fruity, acidic and tangy, with generic berry flavors and an added dose of oak-driven bacon and rubber. Solid at first and then thin on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With good fruit and controlled aromas, it does what young Toro should when done well. Tight in the mouth, with bold black cherry flavors, it bites down with young, big tannins, but it doesn't burn or grate. Shades of mint and chocolate help it along.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A simple quaffer with lime, pineapple and minerally aromas. It's light and easygoing, with a dilute feel and tropical flavors of mango, lime and apple. Lasting and fairly juicy on the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Neutral on the nose, with a slight tropical leaning. Well cut in feel, with good acidity and light, wheaty flavors of banana and citrus. Highly regular, solid and clean. Say no more.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"After wading through some burn and heat on the nose, things settle on basic red fruit. The feel is fresh and zesty, while flavors of plum and berry are about as average and normal as they come. Feels racy, slick and quick on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A tough, sun-belted wine with concentration, big tannins and a ton of power and flavor. The nose is all bacon, balsamic notes, tobacco and roasted black fruit, while the ridged palate is dark and tastes of blackberry, molasses, coconut and brown sugar. Edgy, lemony and tannic on the finish. Drink now with beef; can be held for another 3–5 years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rooty, tough aromas are brambly, while the palate is narrow in feel, drying and tastes of herbal raspberry and cherry. Quite snappy and a little sharp, with a quick finish of red fruit, tomato and zest. Could improve with aging, but at this point the wine, while solid, seems lacking in stuffing.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"For a Ribera rosé, this gets it mostly right. The nose is neutral and standard, while the spunky palate sports good acidity and flavors of strawberry and raspberry. Wet and refreshing on the finish, and good overall.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells a bit cheesy and sour at first, and soon after oak and mild berry fruit take over. On the palate, it's dry, peppery and grabby, with solid but common plum and raspberry flavors. Tomato notes and herbal flavors come up on the finish, but all together it's a good but regular Ribera wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"For a Priorat red, this is lean and snappy, with hot, stemmy aromas and light-bodied, racy fruit flavors. It's a blend of six different grapes, and overall it comes across just well enough to be worth a go. That said, it is kind of short and scratchy given its domain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark in color but a bit hot and clunky on the nose, where oak-based vanilla helps mask its true identity, which is choppy and tart. In between the wine's tang and zest, there's moderate sweetness, vanilla and mild wood notes stemming from the five months it spent in barrel.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A touch stalky on the nose, but after that it gets things mostly right. The fruit aromas and flavors are subdued, with jammy raspberry notes leading the way. There's no overt burn or grating feel, and that's good with inexpensive, niche-filling concept wines like this. Fine if you're expectations are modest.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Yellowing and leesy in character, with a deep, brooding style. Struggles to keep its pulse up; the core flavors are in the bland citrus category, while peachy, leesy secondary flavors turn pithy on the finish. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",Spain,Albariño
"A crusty smelling wine with aromas of crude oil, roasted nuts and modest berry fruit. Feels acidic and scratchy, with balsamic flavors and a chalky finish. Prickly and teetering on sour, with a lasting herbal impression.",Spain,Mazuelo
"Perfumed, chunky and almondy on the nose. Feels full and oily but also a bit juicy, with driving, penetrating orange and grapefruit flavors. Offers proper weight and spicy citrus flavors on the finish. Drink immediately as it's losing freshness and turning yellow.",Spain,White Blend
"A high level of purity from the start. The bouquet attracts with strong scents of mineral, flowers, wild herbs, berry fruit and toast. There's no shortage of bracing acidity, so the body weight and balance are just right. One of Spain's most food-friendly, elegant wines, and not run of the mill. The best expression of Mencia on the market today.",Spain,Mencía
"Baked, earthy and leathery, just like all the AN wines. But there's also a smooth intersection of the old and new worlds here; it's one part rooty, oaky and rich but also dry, leathery and indigenous to the Balearics (the base grape is Callet). Finishes a little sweet and warm, and thus it's begging to be drunk now.",Spain,Red Blend
"A more traditional type of crianza with vanilla, spice, dry berry fruit and a quiet, subtle approach. The mouthfeel is Old World with it's clean, dusty weight and proper acid-tannin balance, and the flavors of spice, cherry, dried currant and earth don't overstep their place. Very nice wine for under $20.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice, clean and vibrant, with a welcoming set of peach, apricot and citrusy aromas. The wine is 100% correct and fresh, with clarity and flavors of apple, peach and green grapes. Shows just enough body, acid and pith on the finish, but drink now before it starts to fade.",Spain,Albariño
"This is a particular style of barrel-aged Verdejo that displays aromas of cured ham, fennel and not much fruit. This has creamy weight on the palate. Flavors of oily white fruits, nuts and charcuterie finish in a blaze of funky flavors, texture and residual oak. This heavyweight white isn't for everyone and it's by no means a mainstream rendition of Verdejo.",Spain,Verdejo
"Pop the cork and look for a bulky Mencía from the little-known region of Ribeira Sacra in Galicia. The wine has rubber, bacon and plum aromas, and then an enamel-like palate of black cherry and herbs. Tough stuff, but unique.",Spain,Mencía
"Smells earthy, leathery and a bit gaseous before you get to a broad palate of stretched berry flavors, vanilla and herbal notes. There are good points here but also gaps in the wine, including a tomatoey quality to the flavor profile. Improves a bit with airing but still it struggles to make the grade.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A simple but pleasant Ribera red with berry-cherry aromas. The palate has a staunch, tannic grab to it as well as flavors of raspberry, black plum and earth. A wine that has o.k. length and solidity to the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A heavy, briary wine that opens with a full blast of earthy compost and burnt leaves. The palate features pointed berry fruit along with a wall of oaky coconut and vanilla. Creamy on the finish, at least in terms of flavor, with lasting vanilla.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Woody and dried out, with oak-based spice and burnt elements on the bouquet. The palate is gritty and acidic, with tart, limited, earthy cherry flavors. Not a disaster, but for a $46 wine from a great vintage it isn't offering many reasons to explore it.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This wine costs a lot for what it's giving. The nose starts out hard and fruitless, and while the aromas come around, the wine always holds onto its corn and haystack character. Zippy acidity gives the mouth zest, and it also livens up papaya, banana and apricot flavors. Complex and different, but does it taste good enough to justify a $78 price tag?",Spain,White Blend
"Starts out stewy, with exotic spice aromas that are uncommon but not unpleasant. That unusual spicy character persists throughout, and the feel is chewy and meaty while the fruit veers toward stewed blackberry, nutmeg and anise. A different breed of cat but a good one nonetheless. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Tropical and forward, and with three months spent in oak, the wine offers some resin and vanilla both on the nose and in flavor. Tastes sweet, honeyed and nutty, with banana and melon notes. An easy drinker that will do best if well chilled.",Spain,Macabeo
"Flowery and sweet smelling, then round and fairly smooth in the mouth. The bubbles and flavor package of tropical fruits galore is pleasant and shouldn't offend anyone. Finishes clean and easy. A mango boat of flavor.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Interesting and very much showing Navarran qualities, including aromas of black olive, herbs and mossy fruit. The palate has good structure, balance and feel, and thus there's a nice platform for dry black cherry, cassis and mocha flavors. As an '05 it's evolved, still fresh enough, and ready to go.",Spain,Red Blend
"Crisp, clean and minerally on the nose, with apple and green-fruit aromas. It has a round, smooth feel and flavors of peach, apple and citrus that will enliven the palate and aid almost any seafood, vegetable or salad. A natural wine with just enough powdery sweetness to raise a smile.",Spain,Albariño
"Very solid and sturdy, with aromas of apple, lemon-lime, soda cracker and mineral. The palate is fuller and more flavorful than your average cava, with candied apple, papaya, lime and lemon flavors. Dry, pithy and hinting at complexity on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A different breed of blended wine, with earthy aromas of dried cheese, leather, dill and vanilla. The palate is tight and mildly tannic, with sweet cola, roasted berry and earthy tobacco flavors. Not your normal bulky, dark wine; it's complex and based on 85% Garnacha and Carignan.",Spain,Red Blend
"Minimum was impressive wine in 2003 and it's better in 2004. Cambra's blend of 70% Monastrell and 30% Cabernet Franc is probably the best wine coming from the obscure Valencia D.O. It is generous, balanced, rich and lusty; flavors of blackberry, cassis and plum are succulent and every hole or gap seems filled by tannin, flesh and flavor. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Red Blend
"A bit jumbled early on, and then more open and minerally. The palate is chunky but hollow, with melon and green fruit flavors. Finishes with a touch of citrus and a soft, quick fade. Bland but easy to drink.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc-Verdejo
"Initially, lemony aromas and flower notes stir interest, while the palate has a medium-to-full feel and pumped-up melon and floral flavors. But with time it grows softer, more pithy and dull. Ultimately it lacks spine and purity of flavors, but how much can you expect from a $10 La Mancha white?",Spain,Verdejo
"Ripe apple and nutty aromas suggest some light oak, while the palate is wet at first and then more drawn and dry as it moves along. Flavors of apple and spice are mildly alluring, while the finish is chunky and broad. Made from the uncommon Vijiriega grape and hails from Granada.",Spain,White Blend
"Opens with dusty dry-fruit aromas along with weight and rubbery notes. The mouth is juicy and tannic, with tough but respectable plum and cherry flavors accented by firm tannins and herbal notes. Dry, quick and herbal on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells like red licorice nibs and stemmy, candied fruit, while the palate is medium bodied, reasonably well balanced and juicy, with berry and plum flavors. It darkens a bit on the finish, where chocolate notes enter the picture. Good for what is a very regular wine.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark, bulky and fairly oaky for a wine of modest DNA. The palate is forceful, juicy and high in acidity, while the flavors of grape juice and black plum are semisour, with leftover oak and vanilla dominating the finish. An average wine on its best day.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A clean, dry, green-fruited wine that's juicy, citric, tangy and features pure orange, lemon and lime aromas and flavors. It's more of a quaffer than anything complex, but with fish or salads it should be just right. The blend is 70% Treixadura with multiple other white grapes including Torrontés, Godello and Albariño.",Spain,White Blend
"Cassis, raisin, vanilla and rooty spice aromas give this Tempranillo blend some class on the bouquet. It's resiny and fairly heavy feeling, with lightly burnt and earthy flavors of herbal red berry and plum. Dry and peppery on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Full, minty aromas come with freshness and don't overpower. The palate is spunky and offers grabby charge, while wild berry, mint and peppery spice are the main flavors. Dark and warm as it finishes; not a shy wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This may appeal more to some than others because barrel-fermented Viura is a tough row. Smells a lot like creamed corn or wheat, with apple cider on the side. It's barely acidic enough, thus it's soft in feel and tastes of butterscotch, melon and flabby apple. Seemingly less interesting than in the past.",Spain,Viura
"Starts out heavy and roasted, with herbal, earthy berry aromas settling in. Feels pruney but there's also acidity, while the flavors run herbal and peppery as prune and plum represent the fruit side. Decent but doesn't fully click.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts out rustic and leathery, with hints of smoke, leafiness and earth along with baked berry and spice. This four-grape wine has good density and mouthfeel that frames leather, earth and slightly baked berry fruit flavors. Finishes chocolaty and sweet, with just enough acidity to maintain balance.",Spain,Red Blend
"A delicious wine and very much the model for value in Spanish Garnacha. That this has 25% Tempranillo only seems to make it better; the nose is sweet but full and plummy. The palate is pure, flavorful and sweet, with baked cherry, earthiness and a hint of chocolate. A wine to buy in quantity, i.e. by the case.",Spain,Red Blend
"Sappy green apple, grapefruit and citrus aromas are welcoming and pure, while the palate is soft-edged, citrusy and full or tangerine and melon flavors. A good, honest, clean Verdejo that has sure-fire mass appeal. More solid than special, which is what you should want from this kind of wine.",Spain,Verdejo
"Nutty and toasty, with toffee and butter pecan aromas. The palate is wet, light, alert and snappy, but also angular and citrusy. The acidity here is key; it pushes dried apricot and tangy flavors toward a nutty finish, and overall the wine delivers what a good, higher-end palo cortado should.",Spain,Palomino
"Fragrant, clean and tropical, with slate-driven minerality. The palate is just fleshy enough but mostly it's tight and crisp, with flavors of green apple, fresh green herbs and a drip of honey. Holds it together from front to back; just right for salads and seafood-based tapas.",Spain,Godello
"Prickly citrus aromas are jumpy and a touch sulfuric. This feels leesy, creamy and fat in the mouth, with creamy, tropical flavors of melon and papaya. Bitter flavors of almond and citrus pith vie with lees-based vanilla notes on a round, plump finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Clean, fresh, presentable aromas of red fruits are easy to like. This is balanced and offers just enough body to support cherry, nectarine and citrus flavors. The finish is crisp and lingers nicely.",Spain,Rosé
"Sweet, candied, oaky aromas get it going, and the palate, while tannic and tough, is thin in its midsection. Flavors of vanilla and marshmallow lead the way, yet the finish falls off fast. Decent wine but shows a forced, candied, oaky personality.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Chunky and bold smelling, with bulky berry aromas that are o.k. but not alluring or elevated. The mouth and flavors are more of the same; there's tight, dark, tannic berry flavors along with toast and burnt rubber late. Finishes with mild heat and oak-based coconut notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The opening runs a bit sour, tomatoey and stemmy, while the palate offers darkness and weight along with savory, herbal flavors that come across earthy and burnt. Tastes as much like tomato paste and herbs as it does berry fruit. Drink now or let it pass.",Spain,Red Blend
"Straightforward and clean, with simple cherry and plum aromas. The palate is tart, juicy and a touch citric, with lightweight cherry skin flavors and a cleansing, fresh, somewhat acidic finish. Tangy and sharp, but not bad for the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not bad for a mass-produced wine. The nose has a distinct sweet, candied character that's like marshmallow, and there's also some burnt stem and bramble thrown into the mix. Tastes mildly pickled, stemmy and burnt, with grabby tannins on the finish. 200,000 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo
"For $7 this white blend from central Spain does about as well as can be hoped for. Transparent in color, with aromas of children's vitamin and apple, it's nothing special but it is wet, drinkable and tasty. Flavors of green apple and citrus lead to a dry, quick finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Catchy name but the wine is basic. The nose is lightly candied with a bit of green and brine. That pickled character translates to the palate, where flavors of cherry and berry are mildly briney. Finishes similarly, with some reedy heat.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Oily and melony smelling and after that it's pretty much your average, innocuous white wine. Feels like orange juice on the palate and tastes like orange and tangerine. Cleansing, fresh enough and easy to drink.",Spain,White Blend
"Here's yet another impressive Garnacha-based wine from the traveling Scotsman Norrel Robertson. There's a black-fruit component that's aided by dried oregano, thyme and briar. The mouth, however, is juicy and ripe, with Syrah-influenced flavors of spice and herbs de Provence. Finishes with licorice, pepper and perfect size. The best wine in Robertson's portfolio.",Spain,Red Blend
"Floral fruit aromas suggest blueberry, but overall this vintage lacks the power and depth that Termes and its big brothers are known for. Airing sets up sweet, easygoing berry flavors and full tannins, but in the middle it's less whole than it has been in other years. A juicy, well-made wine that should not be judged as weak just because 2007 was a marginal vintage. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Opens with cherry aromas and brightness, then the palate fans out and fattens up with juicy plum and cherry flavors along with just a touch of medicinality. Toasty, warm and tasty, with a thoroughness not usually found in $8 wines. Garnacha at 70% with 30% Syrah.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"Very smooth with youthful, juicy, fragrant berry aromas along with a bouncy palate full of sweet cherry and cassis flavors. Clean, snappy, alert and healthy. More simple and straightforward than complex, but worth the money and then some.",Spain,Garnacha
"Yellow in color, with a waxy nose that's baked, rich, a bit stalky but also honeyed. The palate is round, hefty and thick, with full melon and peach flavors in front of a plump, woody finish. Good as you're likely to find among Spanish Chardonnay.",Spain,Chardonnay
"The nose on this Garnacha Blanca is funky and blends aromas of cured ham and salami with lees and citrus. The palate feels right, with solid acidity. Flavors of tangerine, gooseberry and nectarine end pulpy and citric, with a touch of green herbs.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Candied fruit and punch bowl aromas are not what you'd call sophisticated, and the mouth pretty much follows suit with tart, rubbery raspberry fruit that comes on a bit hot and raw. Tough but with full flavor; sort of like chewing on a plum skin.",Spain,Mencía
"Lean, dry aromas of cherry skins and citrus lead to a competent but basic palate of raspberry and cherry flavors. Everything about this wine screams “regular,” from the tart red fruit core to the tough but fresh mouthfeel to the edgy finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Vivid pink in color, with dusty, easygoing raspberry aromas. The palate is a bit soft and low in acidity, which indicates that this is the year to drink the wine...and as soon as possible. Flavors of cherry and strawberry are regular, if a touch bitter toward the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"By no means is this the best wine from Pedrosa; it has decent red berry aromas, but what you really get is minty, forward oak. The palate has an acidic tang to it that suggests medium ripeness, while flavors of cherry tomatoes, herbs, vanilla and mint take you only so far. More barrel than substance here.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Minty-grassy top aromas indicate that the wine, while endowed with decent berry character, has an herbal side as well. In the mouth, it's hard, lean and compact, with tart cherry/plum flavors and a quick finish. Basic with a touch of sourness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with a blast of hot, basic red fruit that's fiery and a little pickled. The palate is lean and acidic but doesn't burn, while the cherry and red plum flavors are elementary. Inoffensive, highly regular red wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of cucumber, mineral and melony white fruits are inviting, while the palate is forward and issues bright, solid flavors of green banana, kiwi and papaya. Well made and friendly for a simple, affordable white Spanish blend.",Spain,White Blend
"Opens clean and friendly, with bacon, cassis and plum aromas. The palate is round, fairly large and pure, with tasty black fruit flavors that are sweet, ripe and throw off a bit of licorice. Finishes long, with brown sugar and a hint of toast. Good value Rioja year in and year out.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mild salinic aromas bring lime and lychee. Feels standard and smooth enough, with sweet white fruit flavors that suggest peach. As a semi-dry, it always feels and tastes sugary.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of oil and almond skins leave things in a neutral state. Feels heavy, round and fleshy, with mealy apple and spice flavors. Feels soft, weighty and pithy on the finish. Lacks the vivacity that Verdejo is known for.",Spain,Verdejo
"Basic cherry and red plum aromas are simple and fresh. Feels tight and crisp on the tongue, with an average body and edgy flavors of strawberry and red plum. Lightly oaked and hollow on the finish, with juicy acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells green and leafy, with tomato leaf, oregano and grassy aromas. Feels clampy and biting, with gritty tannins and roasted, slightly bitter flavors of black plum and pepper. Burnt tasting on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An opening of apricot and peach aromas is proper, while the palate delivers a jolt of zest and acidity to more pineapple, lime and punchy green-apple flavors. Tangy later on, with more than a drop of lemon and lime to the finish. Also slightly pithy and bitter, which is natural for Godello.",Spain,Godello
"Minerality and crispness define the bouquet, which brings green apple and citrus aromas. There's punch and spritz on the palate as well as sweet citrus and juicy lime flavors that break up a little as they fan out. Not sure if there's residual sugar, but the wine tastes a bit sweet.",Spain,Albariño
"Shy at first, with standard raspberry aromas, earth and buttery notes along with cherry and raspberry flavors. Becomes fuller and more satisfying with time, and once it's fully open you have a solid, satisfying Rioja with true flavors and good overall balance.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Same score as the prior year, and pretty much the same wine. It's dusty and slightly burnt in aromas and flavors, with banana, peach and pithy bitterness extending onto the finish. Mouthfeel is the best part; otherwise it struggles to make the cut.",Spain,White Blend
"Saucy and jammy initially, and then a raisiny quality takes over. Plump and thick in the mouth, but ultra jammy in terms of mouthfeel. Syrupy and raisiny flavors run the game, and in the end it weighs in as an overripe wine from one of the hottest vintages on record.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard and earthy, with black fruit aromas that are big but closed. The palate is short, stocky and blocky, with mammoth but basic flavors that turn rubbery. Not much of a finish to speak of.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Disappointing given Telmo Rodriguez's overall track record. Dehesa Gago 2008 is jumpy, sweaty and stemmy smelling, with weedy, burnt, acrid flavors. Green, hard and bitter on the back end, with a candied sweetness. Try as we might, we can't find the higher level in this Toro red.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fairly green, a bit oxidized and old smelling. The palate is short and choppy, with hard leftover tannins and dry, herbal fruit flavors that push up against vegetal. Sweetness re-enters the picture on the finish, but overall this is too dried up and strained to rate higher.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Briary, herbal aromas bring hints of tomato sauce and burnt leaves to the game, while the palate is fairly innocuous in feel. Flavors of herbal berry fruit and beets are sweet and strained, while the finish hints at green herbs and dried leaves.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Leafy, dry and mature, with baked fruit and aromas of dried oregano and basil flakes. The palate has grating tannins, while the flavors are greenish and herbal, with hints of stewed berries and burnt grass. Grabby and stalky; not sure why this old three-grape blend is still on the market.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Banana and green herb aromas make for a challenging nose. The palate has verve and acidity but its flavors of dull white fruits, melon and peach are jumbled. A clumsy mishmash of a wine; 80% Macabeo (Viura) and 20% Chardonnay.",Spain,White Blend
"Bell pepper, green bean, green tobacco, tomato and herb aromas carry the nose toward an acid-dominated palate of tomato sauce and herbal fruit. Finishes dry and herbal, and a little bit sour. With 25% Cabernet, this is a small step up from Earth's 100% Tempranillo.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This pink rosado is 80% based on Garnacha, and it's attractive, light on its feet and aromatic. In the mouth, it's wide and creamy but healthy, with a chunky feel and enough acidity to propel flavors of strawberry and spice. Smooth and on the full side, but well made and ready to drink.",Spain,Rosé
"Clean and smooth to open, with a hint of salinity, powdered sugar and peach. The palate is sheer and zesty, with lemon, green apple and tangy acidity. Crisp yet angular on the finish, but good in a narrow, lean, drilling sort of way.",Spain,Albariño
"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice. Nice but like all varietal Gracianos, it's sharp and limited.",Spain,Graciano
"Clean, simple and very much in the style that has made Las Brisas a go-to value white. Verdejo, Viura and Sauvignon Blanc are married and happy; the nose delivers peach and green apple, while the palate hits with grapefruit, apple, lime and mineral flavors. Clean, crisp, easygoing.",Spain,White Blend
"Ripe peach aromas come with mild oxidized notes and waxy apple scents. This is mouthfilling yet fresh in feel, with punchy acidity. Flavors of baked, spiced apple are a touch briny, and continued similarly to the balanced finish.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Pure apple and peach aromas are the calling card of a good Albariño, and Pazo de Senorans always has that and a little more. The '08 seems a touch less concentrated and leesy than prior years, but it's still showing all the marine-influenced personality, beauty and elegance of a no-oak, seafood-friendly winner. Drink right away; it's not meant for keeping. Imported by European Cellars.",Spain,Albariño
"Smells sweet as cantaloupe, with perfume tossed in. Shows acidity and a smooth bubble wave on the palate along with flavors of watermelon, lychee and cantaloupe. Fresh but quick on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Abnormal by white wine standards, with oily aromas of smoked meat, air freshener and exotic spices. Feels flabby but also dilute, with just enough verve to keep it alive. Flavors of melon and apple are round and spicy, but it's already breaking up and won't last much longer.",Spain,Malvasia
"Sweet apple aromas are highly regular, leading to a round palate without a whole lot of sparkle. Tastes tropical and candied, and there's not much to the mild finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Smells a bit pickled and green at first, with a thick and sweet palate that's not easy to wade through. Sweet lime and orange-mango flavors set up a pithy finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Smells like grapey berry fruits and violets. Feels clampy and tannic, with a rubbery mouthfeel and oaky, slightly green flavors of blueberry and black currant. Grainy and grabby on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with a load of sweet, candied black-fruit aromas but this wine excels on the nose because it's composed and precise for being so young and simple in scope. Velvety, rich black-cherry flavors run the show, and the finish brings length and an herbal shading. Very nice for a wine from Toro at this price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Comes out of the chute with some aggression, but that's settled by quality apple and grassy aromas. The palate is jumpy and lively, with pleasant, slightly sweet apple and peach flavors. Shows good refinement, ample layering of flavors and a spot of minerality. As a whole, this is good cava.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice. And the flavors are friendly and suggest black fruits and smoke. A little more oaky and charred than some, but a nice crianza nonetheless.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty lemon and cidery aromas are solid and draw you in. The palate has a fresh, clean feel and lively, tangy flavors of citrus, green fruits and green herbs. Zesty, a bit lemony, and nice on the finish. Not a complicated bubbly by any means.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dark and fully oaked Rioja with vanilla, mocha, char and black-fruit aromas. The body is good while the acidity is a bit high, and thus the flavors lean toward tart black cherry and zesty wild blackberry all with a robust amount of toast, spice and charred darkness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard, leathery aromas, with an intense but exceedingly tannic palate. Killer bite and raspy, with bitterness and heat. Has decent black fruit flavor but still it's tough and unrefined.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stemmy, pickled aromas send the fruit component to second fiddle. Tastes, smells and feels like a wine that didn't get fully ripe; the flavors are thin and light, with tea and dilute berry. Finishes same as above.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Minerally apple aromas are dusty and yeasty, but straightforward. This feels juicy and a touch plump, with nectarine, citrus and green herb flavors that carry through to the finish.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Maybe it's the Viura, becuase this $9 wine seems cleaner, rounder and slightly better than the winery's higher-priced pure Verdejos. Look for generic but fresh peach and citrus aromas and then lip-smacking citrus flavors. Finishes composed and clean, with lasting grapefruit flavor. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Earthy and baked on the nose, with rubber, black fruits and warm, almost burnt leather notes. The palate has a lively, dense mouthfeel and flavors of earthy berry fruits and raisin. Definitely on the warm and roasted side but still balanced and interesting. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Minerally, dry and clean white wine made from 60% Xarello and 40% Chardonnay. The nose is peachy, while the palate is spritzy and bouncy, with short, slightly creamy apple, melon and papaya flavors that are true to Xarello. Finishes smooth but a little flat.",Spain,White Blend
"Dark and heavily oaked, so if you're into big wines with char, bacon and a lot of spice, this is it...and it's only $14. The palate is tannic and drawing, but lively and loaded with charred, lemony, black fruit flavors. A junior-level, wannabe bigtime Rioja that hints at the region's potential for greatness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Controlled, expressive and impressive for Garnacha. Dark fruit and dark spice are the lead actors, while the supporting cast includes a lush feel and good length. Frankly this is a delicious, well-made Garnacha that pours on the black fruit and brown sugar. Dense and balanced from start to finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Gold in color and lightly oxidized on the nose, and it's still young. Smells heavy and creamy, like hay. Feels flat, with pickled flavors and mealy apple on the finish. Runs plump, sweet and seems like an imposter for Chardonnay.",Spain,Tempranillo Blanco
"Leafy and burnt smelling, with muddled fruit aromas that don't offer much. Feels grabby and tastes mostly of baked berry fruit and bitter spice. Shows some heat and burn on the finish, which is herbal in flavor.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Light in every way, from color to bouquet to weight to flavors. Smells like nettles and grapefruit. Feels wet and dilute, with spritz and flavors of grapefruit and melon. Drink chilled or in a spritzer or white Sangria.",Spain,Verdejo
"Rusty in color, then briney and leafy on the nose, with rooty, nutty, murky plum and earth aromas. Feels clipped and jagged, with tart cherry, citrus and leafy flavors. Dry and hollow on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Brickish in color, with mature aromas of cedar, pine, tobacco, olive and dried fruits. There's still some racy acidity that's keeping the rooty flavors of tobacco, dried berry, coffee and spice moving forward. Finishes dry and a little bit classic; drink now for an affordable taste of Navarra.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins. There's nothing not to like about this Albariño, which is pure, pithy on the finish, and more than solid in a pedestrian, familiar sort of way.",Spain,Albariño
"Smooth on the nose, with a pinch of rubber, earth, smoked beef and plum/prune. The palate offers structure, solid acidity, zestiness and bright flavors of cherry and raspberry. Finishes crisp and tight, with lingering vanilla. A nice wine for tapas and other meat-based dishes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"While I prefer the 2009 for its clarity and freshness, this '08 is no slouching tiger. The nose delivers still-fresh apple and mineral aromas, while the flavor profile leans toward gooseberry, lemon and green melon. Shows some pithy bitterness on the finish, so drink right away or seek out the '09.",Spain,Godello
"Mineral, lime and crisp apple aromas give it a precise, pure nose. And that same character exists on the palate and finish, where white peach, green banana and melon flavors are full and forward. Shows good concentration and quality for a large-production bubbly at this price.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Very strange from the start. Odd stuff, with a candied, spice-like set of aromas that go straight to sweet, dull gumdrop flavors. Feels o.k. on the palate but tastes and smells weird.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Simple to the point of being boring. Aromas of generic white fruits don't stand out, while the palate is soft and tastes vaguely of kiwi and nectarine. Finishes flat. Similar to the 2007.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"Aromas of mealy melon, pineapple juice and warm radiator dust do nothing to distinguish this Viura-led white. The palate is clipped and tangy, with citrus flavors leading to a pithy, orange-peel finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Excessive green bean, green tobacco and grass on the nose put this into the “challenged” category. The palate is tart and tomatoey, with herbal raspberry flavors and a leafy, green finish. Barely registers on the pleasure meter.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite dilute, with gaseous, chemical aromas that subside with time but never really leave. The palate is dry, mulchy and briney, and dig as you might, there is never much fruit to latch onto. Too thin, even for a cool year like 2007.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stemmy and green, with herbal, earthy aromas. The palate doesn't offer much besides acid, stemmy flavors and herbal notes, and there's a spot of green bitterness to the finish. Not a lot going on here; acceptable at best.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard and oily smelling, with an acrid overtone. The palate is grating and tastes of bitter, pithy citrus, while the finish is equally bitter, with grapefruit pith lasting too long. Expensive for what you get.",Spain,White Blend
"Earthy, meaty and leathery, with an herbal quality to the bouquet. The palate is chunky and soupy, with stewed berry, latent sweetness, and a mild herbal aftertaste. Seems syrupy at points and then fresher and better at other times. Has its good qualities but finishes short.",Spain,Monastrell
"A big, dark, heavily oaked wine with caramel, resin and baked berry aromas. The palate has a thick, meaty feel, slightly abrasive tannins, and then sweet, sticky, woody black fruit flavors. Finishes with brown sugar and more wood flavor; strives for a higher level but gets bogged down with barrel influence.",Spain,Monastrell
"Yeasty, sweet and easy on the nose, with apple, vanilla and pear aromas. The palate has a nice feel and flavors of citrus, spiced meats and baked apple. For basic cava this is focused and forward, with lively acidity and good overall balance.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This style of oak-fermented Verdejo probably does better in cool years, which 2009 was not. As a result, this smells a bit oxidized and nutty, with baked apple scents. In the mouth, it is weighty and a touch dull; flavors of butterscotch and cashew finish with cider, salt and buttery notes. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"This barrel-aged white Rioja is as close to Burgundy as you're going to find in Spain. It has a lot of oak throughout, but with vanilla, spice, cinnamon and more it works. Apple, baked citrus and resin from the barrel make it complex and food-worthy, and if you were to serve this with grilled or baked fish you could leave the Montrachet for next time. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",Spain,White Blend
"A deep and dense wine, with coconut and blackberry dominating the weighty, powerful bouquet. This is an organic wine with an explosive palate of berry fruit and plenty of juicy acidity to keep it fresh and healthy. Toast, chocolate and cola are the finishing notes, and overall it's a strapping wine to drink now thru 2013. Imported by Organic Vintners.",Spain,Red Blend
"Reduced and green on the nose, with an overriding aroma of beet juice. Thick and almost cloying, with a jammy, stewy, stemmy set of flavors that finish herbal and green. Has darkness and weight but little more; 50% Tempranillo and 50% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Smells briney and pickled, much like sauerkraut. The palate has an angular feel, choppy acidity and pickled flavors of apples and wheat. Briney to the max; not very appealing year after year.",Spain,Tempranillo Blanco
"Nice enough on the nose, but like soda in the mouth. Tastes lean and lemony on one take, then like apple cider on the next take. Loses steam as it goes; no lift to the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Herbal and stripped back, with rhubarb aromas and fiery acidity once it hits the palate. Tastes of herbs, tomato and pie cherry. Sour on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance. Powerful acidity pushes it in the right direction, and the finish of lychee, passion fruit and nectarine is lasting. Very nice wine but relatively high in price.",Spain,Albariño
"Stylistically, this is at odds with what I feel Albariño should be. That said, it's a well-executed and well-made barrel-fermented white with full-force toast and popcorn aromas followed by a resiny, vanilla-fueled flavor profile that folds in apple, banana and creamy frosting. Still vital and healthy after three years in bottle.",Spain,Albariño
"For Navarran Merlot-Cab, Inurrieta Norte is always a winner. This vintage has good darkness along with smooth aromas of black fruit, earth, rubber and spice. It's a bit acidic and shrill as a tasting wine but will do fine at the table. The mouth is spunky and shows slightly herbal raspberry and plum flavors. Finishes light and easy.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"For a rosado cava, this offers nice fruit, balance and complexity. The nose is pure cherry and raspberry, but in subdued doses. Meanwhile, it's zesty, foamy and fresh in the mouth, with nectarine, plum, strawberry and prickle. Perfectly nice for everyday quaffing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Lacks freshness; pickled and leathery, with heavy, bruising tannins. Dull, pounding flavors of plum and prune are short and fierce. Rough country wine.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
Seems like it's past its sell-by date. Smells musky and tastes sweet and gummy. Candied papaya and mango is about all you get. Low-pulse stuff.,Spain,Pansa Blanca
"Vanilla wafer aromas leave this taster lost. The longer it airs out, the more weird the wine gets. Milk chocolate, vanilla and marshmallow dominate everything from aromas to feel to flavor to finish. A barrel-fermented rosé from Ribera Del Duero: why?",Spain,Rosé
"Probably not to everyone's liking, but this oak-fermented Verdejo is a bit like Burgundy and/or white Bordeaux. Cured meat, match stick and pineapple-lemon aromas work their way onto the mildly oaky nose, while the palate has a vanilla-based lushness that works well. Rich, opulent and classy. A sincere food wine.",Spain,Verdejo
"Grapefruit, melon, lime and match stick aromas give this Rueda a solid opening. The palate is fruity and a bit green and phenolic, with flavors of green melon, grass, cucumber and tangerine pith. Simple and clean on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Apple and mineral aromas are basic but clean, and the palate is fresh and lithe, with little to no extra weight. Flavors of dry apple and fresh corn work well, and while the finish is short and shy, it's crisp and clean. A simple wine with light fruit and easy drinkability.",Spain,White Blend
"Full and blowsy for Verdejo, with orange, grapefruit and minerally aromas. The palate is zesty, with orange, tangerine and passion fruit flavors. With pretty good fruit character, adequate acidity and a slick-feeling finish, this is a good effort that should be drunk right away.",Spain,Verdejo
"On the nose, this is gritty and a bit stalky, with peach-pit bitterness. The mouthfeel and body are good, while flavors of melon, peach and green banana are stalky and lightly bitter.",Spain,Albariño
"Generic white-fruit aromas of peach and apple are slightly pithy. This feels good but innocuous, while flavors of apple and stone fruits lose some of their snap and directness on a tropical-tasting finish.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"A “Wow” type of blended white from one of the modern pioneers of Priorato. Nelin is quite spectacular as it delivers layered, dry aromas and equally impressive melon, honey and peachy flavors. Smooth, silky and stylish, with cerebral as well as base-level appeal. In perfect condition now. Hard not to love this classy wine.",Spain,White Blend
"If you like lusty, ripe, full-bodied reds, then scoop this up because it's excellent and priced to sell. The nose is rich, crusty and minerally, with a ton of black fruit. The palate is layered and creamy, with ultra- ripe, concentrated black fruit, chocolate and café mocha flavors. Pure and deep; drinkable now and over the next few years.",Spain,Mencía
"The iconoclastic Emilio Rojo produces this five-grape blend from terraced vineyards located in inland Galicia. The wine is lush, rich and shows barrel characteristics and depth. The nose is toasty and alluring, but the real play comes in the mouth, which is healthy as an ox, with layered flavors of baked apple, tropical fruits and honey. Long on the finish, with an appealing texture and fine acidity. In perfect condition now; drink through 2013.",Spain,White Blend
"Big, rich and extremely impressive given the price; this wine competes with and beats some Riberas that cost five times more. It's textured, deep, silky and layered, with integrated berry, plum and cassis flavors. Packed and generous all the way to the finish; drink now or cellar for up to 10 more years. From 80-year-old Tempranillo vines.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A classy, rich style of modern Rioja that gets everything right. The nose is a mix of bacon, cinnamon, baked blackberry, pepper and vanilla, while the lush palate is alive with layered flavors of black plum, coffee, black tea and baking spices. Long on the finish, and fabulous as a whole. Drink now through 2016.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nothing if not stout and fruity. This is a big, modern Syrah with a mountain's worth of plum, berry and currant character on the nose, palate and finish. The acidity is a bit jagged and amplified, which creates some crispness, tension and pop. But overall it's a burly specimen that despite 20 months in oak does not taste woody. Drink or hold until 2012. Imported by Kobrand.",Spain,Syrah
"Aromas of cherry and leather come with burnt earth and smoke, but overall the nose is inviting. The palate is solid in feel, with good weight and drive that supports a smoky flavor profile of red berries and controlled bitterness. Finishes toasty, with a lick of bitter chocolate.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A perfectly solid Garnacha with pepper, bright red fruit and a touch of country style to the bouquet despite its pedestrian price. The palate is bright and tastes of plum and red berry, while the feel is good and the finish fruity and lively. What inexpensive red wine should be.",Spain,Garnacha
"Maderized and corny smelling, with mustard, herbs and flowery notes. Tastes sweet and cidery, with not much vitality. Could be better.",Spain,Moscato
"Colorful and pretty to look at, but a little sweet. The nose has a sweet, maple syrup element along with dry berry fruit aromas. It's healthy and fresh in the mouth, with citrus, cranberry and raspberry flavors. Simple and nice for easy drinking.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A warm, aggressive wine with baked berry aromas, kirsch, bacon and rubber. The palate has hard, astringent tannins but the flavors are good once they air out; there's blackberry, plum and brown sugar. Firms up on the finish as the tannins do their thing. Tasted twice with divergent findings; this note reflects the common traits from both wines.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is the first Las Brisas rosado that's come to us, and it's good in a tangy, tropical sort of way. The nose delivers mango along with light citrus and berry, while the palate is tangy, jumpy, citric and tastes mostly of orange and tangerine. Good but fairly monotone in aromas and flavors; made from 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Rosé
"This white blend from Mallorca is melony up front and, like an island wine is prone to show, saline is all over the nose. In the mouth, this is melony but not too soft, with flavors of papaya, banana and honeydew. A smooth, creamy finish says drink this soon.",Spain,White Blend
"Dusty, leesy stone-fruit aromas form an easy bouquet. Made from the Pansa Blanca grape, this is pulpy and leesy on the palate, conveying creaminess. Flavors of mild citrus, nectarine and pear run sweet and ripe. A finish with peach and melon flavors is just bright and vital enough to avoid flabbiness.",Spain,Pansa Blanca
"Earthy, dark and meaty wine, with rubber, deep black fruit, bacon and leather on the nose. This is a typical huge wine from Atauta, with roasted plum, blackberry and ingrained spice flavors. Long on the finish, with tobacco, herb and oak character. Drinkable now but it's hard and tannic; better to wait three to 12 years.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Dark and crusty on the nose, with full-force aromas of blackberry, licorice and mineral. The palate is full but not too tight or hard; there's a welcome softness to the wine but also nice acidity. Tastes great, with loads of black fruit, chocolate and toast. Modern, with plenty of oak. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Mencía
"Earthy, deep and meaty, with rubber and heft to the nose, but also a ton of black fruit. Texturally, it's like velvet; and the palate is super ripe and lengthy, with flavors of blackberry, mocha, coffee and fine oak. A Syrah-led, full-bodied beauty that's subtle and not overpowering. Drinkable now but best in about 3-5 years.",Spain,Red Blend
"Big and dark, and it comes with no shortage of prune, blackberry, smoky oak and depth. A lusty flavor profile filled with blackberry, cola, clove and chocolate is stout and satisfying, while the dark finish sports licorice and bitter cacao. Forthright and chunky wine. Drink now into 2011. Imported by Fine Estates From Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Clear and focused, with raspberry and edgy spice aromas to the nose. The palate doesn't bring a whole bunch of meat or heft, but it is clean, racy and food-friendly. Flavors of red berries and pepper are normal and expected, while the finish is dry and lean.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lime, citrus and other pungent aromas get it off to a good start, while the palate is wet and fresh, with clean, familiar grapefruit, lime and nectarine flavors. Lighter and less concentrated than Naia, but still a very good Verdejo for the price.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dry and subtle on the nose, with cherry and plum fruit scents mixed with balsam wood. The palate is tight, simple and offers a bit of creaminess to go with raspberry and oak-based vanilla and mocha. Light on the finish and fresh, with a medium body.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Timid but clean as a whistle on the nose, with apple and vanilla aromas along with a sprinkling of talcum powder. The palate is lively and fresh, with flavors of pineapple, lemon and other tropical hints. Entirely pedestrian as cava goes, but 100% clean and refreshing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dry and peppery to start, with muted berry fruit aromas along with wood shavings. The palate is snappy, clean and juicy, with raspberry, vanilla and tobacco-like flavors. More basic than special, with a steady, light-framed finish. More than functional; likely good with food.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dusty apple and a clean lightness define this basic, totally enjoyable white blend that is based on the pedestrian Airén grape but features 30% Macabeo. The palate is fresh and easy, with apple, citrus and white pepper flavors. Finishes crisp.",Spain,White Blend
"Big, sweet and deep in black fruits, with aromas of turned earth and sweet spices. The palate is tannic and heavy but offers good pop, and the flavors of blackberry and cola are full-force. Finishes thick and dark, with toasty spice notes and kick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Give this wine credit for consistency: in the three years it's been on the market it has scored the same each vintage. This offering is soft, fleshy and slightly green on the nose, with a wet, easy palate that gives mild citrus, apple and peach flavors. Good in the mouth, with just enough acidity to keep it kicking.",Spain,Viura
"This oaky Chardonnay is tan and maderized but still mostly vital and fresh on the nose and palate. Aromas of resiny oak, toast and smoke outmuscle subtle fruit notes, while the palate is plump, melony and offers creamy, oaky flavors that finish toasty and resiny.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Fresh, pure and minerally, with lime and peach aromas. This is a fine Viura that is lively, balanced and flavorful. The citrus and apple flavors ring true, and the mouthfeel isn't raw or jumpy. Instead, a mineral and chalk element smooths it out, and overall it sings. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Spain,Viura
"Full and clean, with a bright nose of cherry, plum and pepper. This is full-bodied, with extract and tannic bite. But the flavors of berry and plum are solid and round, while burnt-toast notes darken up the finish. Lots of snap and focus. Modern and ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"Good value for a bear of a wine. It's 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet, and it certainly has teeth. Stocky aromas of blackberry, bacon and tobacco are inviting, while the palate is saturated, tannic and full of black fruit, bacon and brown sugar. Finishes with weight and coffee/chocolate flavors. Not a shy wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A big set of roasted aromas includes hints of smoke, mineral, bacon and black fruit. The palate is balanced and lifted by proper acidity, so the black-fruit flavors do not come across as heavy or cooked. Savory stuff, with vanilla and herb accents on a firm, long finish. Good structure; well-made wine.",Spain,Tinta Fina
"Even in a marginal vintage, you should expect a true and polished taste of Toro from Maurodos's Prima label. Blackberry, cherry and plum aromas are bonded by light balsam-like oak, while the palate is structured and delivers plenty of ripe black fruit. Chocolate and pepper on the finish seem right for the wine, which nails the Toro style even if it isn't a blockbuster. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"On the money right from the start, where deep aromas of black fruits, minerality and fresh herbs mingle nicely. The palate is creamy and smooth, with rich, almost syrupy berry, cream, coffee and toffee flavors. Oaked up but not “oaky,” with caramel and chocolate on the smooth finish. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Red Blend
"A big, dark, modern wine with lemon and shoe polish on the nose but also rich black fruit aromas. The palate is both elegant and beefy, with lush blackberry and copious spice and chocolate flavors. Finishes full, mossy, rich and slightly herbal. A big success for varietal Rioja Grenache; drink now through 2012.",Spain,Garnacha
"This vintage rosado is as good as always, but a bit lower on the quality ladder than previous years. The color is light pink and soft on the eye, while the nose suggests brick dust and orange peel. Smooth and easygoing, with sweet, generic flavors of orange and berry.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Normally this producer's high-end Sherries are outstanding, but this Amontillado is aggressive and hard, with a clod-like character that starts with molasses on the nose and then turns toward sharpness and bitterness on the palate. Try as I might, this one strikes me as good but loud, hard, forceful and lacking the suavity that great Sherries possess.",Spain,Sherry
"This is your quintessential simple quaff among brut cavas. It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors. It's slightly sweet and tropical, but still it holds onto its crisp qualities and dryness. No complaints for the money.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Slightly low on kick and bubbles for a blanc de blancs, but the wine's mix of green herb, apple, green banana and melon flavors is good and offers the proper set up to a finish that's citrusy as can be and only slightly pithy. Seems a touch flat or it might have rated even higher.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dusty, slightly candied aromas are briary and pretty good, and overall it's giving freshness, pop and red-fruit flavors touched up by dill, nutmeg and vanilla. Clean and lively on the finish, and more than competent as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts out with roasted, stewy, beefy aromas and not much brightness. The palate is measured and healthy, with dry raspberry, currant and medicinal plum flavors. It shows oak, earth, leather, acidity and some burn. In a nutshell, it's a good, standard, respectable Rioja that will complement almost any food.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A heavy, slightly strained wine that has a lot in tow. The nose is smoky, rubbery like an inner tube, and a bit herbal. In the mouth, it's a wide load with sweet, sugary, baked flavors of blackberry, prune, fig and chocolate. Very much on the ripe side, with a full tannic bite.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Initially it's rugged, but airing reveals black-cherry aromas and dry spice. The palate is crisp and a little sheer by itself, but the call here is that with food it'll be a winner. Flavors of red fruits are dry and collected, while the finish blends in coffee, spice and a touch of herbal Navarran panache.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Good on the nose, with solid raspberry and nectarine aromas. The palate is spunky and alert, with juicy red-cherry, rhubarb and integrated spice flavors. It's mostly a clean, basic, easy-to-drink bubbly, but it's persistent, harmonious and commendable. Pinot Noir with Trepat is the grape mix.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of apple cider and mild spice get it going in a good direction, and this colorfully packaged cava does pretty well in the mouth, where the texture is on the soft side and the flavors of apple and orange run a bit sweet. Not complex but good, fluffy and yeasty.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Sweet and lightly floral on the nose, but also kind of generic and wan. The palate is wet, with hollow white fruit and apple flavors. There's snap to the finish but not a lot of flavor other than simple citrus. A good quaffer but nothing more than that.",Spain,Albariño
"Leather, roasted berry and barnyard make for a rustic, warm nose. The palate is grippy, with chewy, roasted black fruit flavors. Meaty, lasting, deep and dense, but also rubbery and a little low on acidic vitality. A Monastrell-Tempranillo blend to drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"A lot of depth and minerality jump up from the bouquet. The palate on this slate-driven Godello is rich but right, the perfect balance between body, acidity and fruit pulp. Tastes of dry spiced apple and melon, with a bit of citrus. A stately, elegant wine with power to boot. Ideal for Valdeorras.",Spain,Godello
"Smooth and powerful on the nose, with oak-based aromas and clean berry fruit. There's elegance as well as richness to the deep berry, chocolate and vanilla flavors. Finishes with toffee and coffee, but it's not particularly woody even if it is fairly oaky. A decidedly modern and international type of wine. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Mencía
"This Syrah-Garnacha blend is lush and dense, with attractive licorice and blackberry aromas. It's lusty in the mouth, but balanced as it deals largescale blackberry, pepper, spice and bitter chocolate flavors. Toasty on the finish, with black coffee. A full-bodied winner that's dynamic and overdelivers for the price.",Spain,Red Blend
"The bouquet has a distinct lemon, pine and herb element along with black fruit and mocha. It's fairly snappy and tannic, with clipping bite but also fresh, floral flavors of blueberry and herbs. Toasty and long on the finish, with some herbal leftovers and licorice. By all evidence available, 2006 was a great vintage for Bierzo reds.",Spain,Mencía
"Rich, earthy and structured, with graphite, bacon and dense black fruit aromas that promise the wine will pack punch. With big, biting tannins, it does that. The palate is dark and tight, with coffee, mocha and tough berry flavors. Finishes dry, toasty and tannic; needs three-plus years and will cellar well through 2020.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Deep purple in color, with minty, exotic aromas that suggest latex but also richness, vanilla, mocha and spice. The palate is meaty and deep, with smooth-flowing flavors of blackberry, licorice, chocolate and pepper. Young, rich and balanced; hold for two years then drink. 76% Syrah with Monastrell and Bobal.",Spain,Red Blend
"A touch raisiny and sweet from nose to tail, but what's in between is convincing for Jumilla. Aromas of licorice and herbs are sweet but nice, while the flavors or raisin and blackberry are chunky, with a basic finish that's a little flat but definitely ripe. A blend of Monastrell, Cabernet, Tempranillo and Merlot that's ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"For Spanish Chardonnay, this is perfectly good and clean. The nose brings your basic set of white-fruit, mineral and fresh herb flavors, while the palate is lively despite some dry, resiny oak flavor. Even with banana, vanilla and creamy flavors, the wine is decidedly not cloying.",Spain,Chardonnay
"This winery is known for red Mencía, but this small-lot Godello is perfectly nice and drinkable. It has a neutral nose and a fresh palate of green melon, nectarine and apple flavors. The finish is clipped and a touch bitter, but there's no denying its tangy, forward approach. Only 250 cases made.",Spain,Godello
"Dusty earth and dry spice aromas blend with some char, vanilla and berry/cherry on the nose. The palate shows average density and depth, with lighter flavors of strawberry, raspberry, herbs, tobacco and vanilla. Finishes dry and peppery, with some toast.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with a nice combination of melon, honey and mineral aromas. The wine is fresh and properly acidic, with defined apple, nectarine and melon flavors. On the finish, it's drying and lightweight, with a hint of papaya and a note of pith. Good overall; drink now.",Spain,Godello
"Berry fruit and mild leather open this good little bargain. There's adequate body and fullness, some oak, and then bright, fresh berry, herb and spice flavors. Finishes dry and lightly toasted, with coffee notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with sharp cherry, cola and mint aromas. The palate is fairly acidic and sheering, but it's also zesty and fresh, with clean berry and mild raisin flavors. Offers reasonably good length, with an acidic choppiness balanced by good fruit flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This Verdejo is in its late stages of life but it's hanging in there. Mostly neutral aromas of apple and lime set up a palate with citrusy acidity that keeps the wine alive. Narrow, simple flavors of orange and nectarine finish pithy but true to the variety. Drink immediately.",Spain,Verdejo
"Green apple and peach aromas are straightforward and come with a pinch of warm radiator dust. The wine remains fresh, juicy and moderately stony on the palate, with minerally apple and peach flavors. Fresh acidity and a light body allow it to hold steady on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Covers all the principle bases via aromas of ripe dark fruit, bacon, spice and herbs. The palate is a bit soft but it's serious, with raspberry, cherry and plum flavors. Tastes slightly roasted on the finish, with spice and solid tannins. Ranks as a very good all-occasion red. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Here's a bright, forward, no-issues Garnacha that shows the upside of Calatayud and the grape in general. It's a touch raw and racy, but otherwise it's a nice wine with forward cherry flavors and a lightly charred, earthy finish. Pointed and racy, which is what you want from Spanish Garnacha.",Spain,Garnacha
"Big on the nose, with regionally typical aromas of mineral, black fruit and herbs. The palate is a touch rough and hot, but it houses forward black plum, raisin and chocolate cake flavors. Fleshy and pretty big, but sort of wayward on the finish. Shows good structure and power. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Expressive white wine from the high plains of central Spain. Pie Franco is one of the more forward, high-quality wines from Rueda. It's 100% Verdejo and thus it sizzles with green apple, melon, citrus and celery aromas and flavors. Almost like dry 7Up in the mouth, with spritz, zest and persistence. Drink now. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Verdejo
"Remírez de Ganuza has a track record of excellence, and this is yet another dense, deep, sultry Rioja that has become customary. Reflecting the warm '06 vintage, the wine is chunky in the mouth, with thick blackberry, boysenberry, chocolate and almond candy flavors. It's toasty and dark on the finish, but also a touch soft, much like chocolate cake. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pretty on the nose and floral. The color is burnished gold, conveying richness and ripeness. Very creamy and sweet tasting, reflective of the 85% Viognier at the wine's core. Transitions from plump melon and peach flavors to vanilla and spice on the finish. Excellent body and acidity make for a deep wine. Contains 15% white Grenache and Chenin Blanc.",Spain,White Blend
"A big, dark wine with bacon, blackberry, stewed black cherry and dark spice aromas. The palate is pure, lush and fun, while the flavors are full and dark, emphasizing licorice, blackberry, chocolate, fig and coffee. Delicious and easygoing in that modern RDD style. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean and minerally, with stony aromas along with banana and pineapple. The palate is tight, clean and balanced, with flavors of green banana, papaya and apple. Finishes pithy and with a touch of fresh-grated white pepper. A good but common type of unoaked Chardonnay.",Spain,Chardonnay
"A clean, fresh, appealing sort of Tempranillo with cola, earth, black cherry and berry aromas followed by a bright, forward, spicy cherry palate. Honest, snappy, healthy and juicy; nice and solid for La Mancha.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Simple, nice and not trying too hard; this basic brut is graced with nice apple and citrus aromas. The palate is wet, juicy and classic, with crisp apple, green herb and melon flavors. Round, clean and just crisp enough.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish. For under $15 this is good, casual Albariño that won't steer you wrong.",Spain,Albariño
"A throwback style, with creamy vanilla, dill, tomato and raspberry aromas. The palate is just round and lush enough to not be edgy, but there's ample acid to drive the plum, cherry, cola and raisin flavors toward a clean, linear finish. No miracles here; just good, well-made, fairly traditional Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Starts with aromas of beef jerky, licorice and berry syrup. It's a brawny, dark wine with jammy blackberry flavors along with chocolate cake and thick, grabbing tannins. Finishes sweet and syrupy, with heavy saturation and big tannins. Not in perfect balance and by no means a great wine from Mauro. But it's still good for an off year. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, Imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A floral, heavy style of blended white made from Macabeo, Gewürztraminer and Chardonnay. It has an exotic streak to the aromas along with smoked ham, fennel seed and gardenia. The palate is thick and tastes of papaya, salami and baked apple. It's a hodgepodge of abnormal aromas and flavors, but all totaled it works pretty well.",Spain,White Blend
"Waxy apple and pear aromas come with butterscotch and dusty scents. The body on this barrel-fermented Viura rates as round and full, while flavors of apple, peach and spiced citrus finish yeasty, long and slightly oxidized.",Spain,Viura
"Montecillo's first effort with Albariño is perfectly crisp and pleasant. The nose offers pure citrus and tropical fruit, the feel is even and balanced, and the flavors are dry and veer toward apple and green melon. Long on the finish and nicely integrated; one of the best under-$15 Albariños going. Imported by Underdog Wine Merchants.",Spain,Albariño
"Briary, spicy and complex on the nose, with hints of tomato adding earth tones to red berry aromas. Zesty and vivacious in the mouth, with all the raspberry, dill, vanilla and tanned leather that a fine Rioja should deliver. Rock solid and driving; one of the best wines yet from Baron de Ley; drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dry, smoky and alluring, with herb, pine, schist, licorice and vanilla aromas. This is pure, tight and clean as a whistle, with dark, smoky, sultry flavors of baked black fruits, spice and licorice. Oak comes through on the finish, which is chocolaty and long. A classy wine to drink now thru 2015.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fresh and full of lime on the nose, and overall this is simple, smooth and gives you little reason to worry or fuss. The palate is smooth, creamy and a little low on acids, thus the lemon-lime and melon flavors have a fullness that's sweet and good.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Sweet and a little grassy on the nose, with lemon-lime aromas. The palate has a solid, regular, friendly feel along with sweet flavors of white nectarine, apple juice and tarragon. Perfectly quaffable, dry in feel despite being semisweet, and balanced. For the price, what's not to like? Imported",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Light in color, with a candied, red fruit nose that's sweet and not very oaky. The palate is juicy but simple, with flavors of herbal raspberry and spice. Not overly complex but good due to its fresh, floral outlook.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet, open and floral, like a Malvasia or Moscatel. For a clear, easy quaffer this is nice. It tastes like lime and lychee, and also a little bit like applesauce. Nothing special in terms of finish or intensity, but for a light, tropical white wine it gets it done.",Spain,Viura-Chardonnay
"Aromas of pineapple, cider and citrus are good but basic. It's fleshy and soft in the mouth (call it pulpy) with mild grapefruit, passion fruit and tropical melon flavors. Finishes soft, chunky and pithy. Drink ASAP.",Spain,Verdejo
"Nothing is exciting or disappointing about this center-lane Viura (with 10% Malvasia). It's neutral on the nose and then creamy, soft and easy in the mouth, with papaya and cantaloupe flavors. Finishes mellow, with a spot of bitterness.",Spain,White Blend
"This is Luna Beberide's “kitchen sink” blend consisting of Mencia, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine has blackberry and violet aromas, and as a whole it's inviting and smooth. Flavors of berry fruit are solid but modest, while herbal accents and baking spice notes jazz things up. With more follow-through and some artistic touches, this could be even better. As is, it's a perfectly good red blend.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pedro Ximénez is the grape for this fino-style wine, not the usual Palomino. It's made in the dry style, with peach, papaya and spicy, yeasty aromas. Where it differs most from a normal fino is in the mouth, where things get big and gangly. It's slightly bitter as well, with apple, lemon and an echo on the finish.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Coconut and saline aromas fold in toast, berry and a whiff of green bean. This is a solid wine with a tight, semi-tart personality reflective of the cool, wet vintage that was 2002. So with decent berry, vanilla and tobacco flavors offset by a mildly scratchy mouthfeel, it is more of a success than a miss. Drink now. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, Imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A maderized color is apropos for the wine's fully mature, nutty nose. This is big and cidery feeling, with apple and orange flavors. A finish of vanilla, nuttiness and oxidation matches the color and aromas of this interesting but midlevel Tempranillo Blanco.",Spain,Tempranillo Blanco
"With mineral, apple and peach aromas, this gets off on the right footing. The palate is zesty and acidic, with a tangy set of apple, citrus and mineral flavors. Controlled heft, weight and spritz on the finish make it a solid bet. Look for the weird blue bottle and take it from there. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Spain,Albariño
"Good and lusty, with dark aromas of kirsch, chocolate, shoe polish, burnt oak and perfume. And while it may lack some focus, the palate is flush with ripe black fruit touched up by wood spice, pepper and herbs. Finishes generous and solid, with olive and savory herb notes. Drink now; 16,800 cases made. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rich and buttery, with corn flakes, baked apple, pear and a touch of wood resin on the nose. Apple cider, vanilla, toast and cream flavors are satisfying, while the long finish rests mostly on texture and leftover vanilla. An interesting barrel-aged wine made from the obscure Dona Blanca grape that's mostly used for making a grappa-like distilled spirit.",Spain,Doña Blanca
"Chunky and rubbery smelling at first, then out comes black fruit, oak and licorice in spades. This is a modern, dark wine from old Mencía vines that's very tasty and rolls across the palate with ease. It's a little syrupy and very ripe, with hints of herbs on the finish as well as cocoa and fig. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Mencía
"Tight and honest from the start, with match stick, yeast, bitter greens and apple aromas. The palate is lifted but not heavy, with firm acidity, fine carbonation and bright apple, peach and dryness to the flavor profile. Fresh, long and pure on the finish; classy given the price.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A neutral cava with white candy and mango on the nose. The palate is both foamy and scouring, with soda cracker, apple and citrus pith creating the flavor profile and finish. Shows basic flavors, normal mouthfeel and scouring acidity.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Opens somewhat clipped and choppy, with citrusy aromas mixed with red fruits. The palate is healthy, lean and acidic, with bright plum and berry flavors softened by some creamy vanilla. A solid wine with punch, acidity and a good finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lucid and basically colorless, with flowery, lychee-like aromas that suggest Malvasia or Moscatel. But it's only Viura and Chardonnay, and it tastes fresh, floral and nice, with lime and lychee. About as easy as they come.",Spain,White Blend
"A bit unusual and confusing, but that's because it hails from the Rioja region. The nose is herbal and mustardy, with green aromas leading to a cidery palate of apples and spice. There's also a bit of lemon and creaminess to this cava. Hard to understand but not without its merits.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Light in color and more neutral and clean smelling than anything. The palate is airy and offers simple, pleasant melon and pear flavors. About as easygoing as they come; a no-frills white wine that's tasty, lightweight and a bit sweet.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"A bit hard and sharp on the nose, but on the plus side it's clean and direct. The palate follows suit; it's reasonably balanced, with forward strawberry, raspberry and mocha flavors. Dry and quick on the finish, with a mild resiny leftover oak character.",Spain,Monastrell
"Full and sweet smelling, but also a little cidery. The palate is drawn, narrow and citrusy, with grapefruit, passion fruit and orange for core flavors. Finishes citrusy and a touch vapid; overall it shows flashes of elegance but not enough to rise above average.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light and citrusy on the nose, with hints of spice, sweet cherry and dusty earth. The palate has a drawn, lean feel along with freshness and flavors of red fruits, plum and mild spice. Offers enough good character and power to be worth a go.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet and raisiny, and not in the best shape. This mature Rioja is drying in the mouth and a bit overaged already; it tastes of raisin, coffee and spice, but there's a bit of heat and baked character to it as well. For an '04 reserva it's just not as lively and fresh as it should be.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A nice wine with almost everything in the right place. It starts with medium-intensity black cherry and plum aromas, with a hint of pickle and leather in the background. The palate is lively and full of brimming cherry and raspberry flavors, while the finish is stout and tannic, with vanilla and cream to warm things up. Packed and serious for a $14 wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A bit heavy and raisiny, but still this wine gets it right. The body, nose and everything else about it is rich and robust, but while it pushes candied fruit to the brink, it draws back and showcases brandied cherry, toffee, chocolate and other rewarding flavors in a good way. Sticky and sweet for sure, but not unctuous or cloying.",Spain,Monastrell
"Contino gives its single-vineyard Graciano all that it can, and still the wine, despite its deep purple color, is tight as a drum. There's juniper and blueberry on the nose, and then tangy blackberry flavors with an herbal slant. As varietal Graciano goes, this is nicely done. But it's up to you to decide if varietal Graciano is worth $147 a pop.",Spain,Graciano
"With a bright pink color, this shows slightly heavy aromas of watermelon and red apple skins. It is medium to full in body but fresh, with candied red-fruit and citrus flavors. A fresh, properly acidic finish does the job.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"What a monster this is. Aromas of roasted meat, compost, leather, berry and plum give it a rugged bouquet, while the superripe palate is big as sin and loaded with ultrasweet blackberry, soy and peppery flavors. Succulent, chocolaty and dark, it's like an earthquake in your mouth. Expensive for what you get, and recommended solely for fans of huge, modern wines. Imported by Kobrand.",Spain,Petite Verdot
"This is a nice Rueda wine that is on the cusp of excellence. With citrus, pine and tropical fruit aromas, it is fleshy and shows good body and feel. Flavors of peach and pineapple are full, while the finish is rich and almost creamy in texture. Drink immediately. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Verdejo
"More familiar and less unusual than prior vintages. This wine deals typical, upright lemon, lime and tropical fruit aromas backed by green apple and lemon-based flavors. With good acidity and an even keel, it is a solid, fresh, dry Albariño that should not disappoint. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Albariño
"This is Scottish winemaker Norrel Robertson's unoaked, straightforward Garnacha. It has mildly stemmy, all-natural aromas followed by zesty red-fruit flavors, herbal accents and a quick, acid-washed palate and finish. There's ample body and power, and fresh, candied red-fruit character.",Spain,Garnacha
"The quality of the 2009 vintage is reflected in this value-priced Toro that's full and medicinal but also balanced and rewarding. Flavors of medicinal red-berry fruit are mixed with thicker, chocolaty notes, while the finish is bold, grabby and solid. A blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Clean and approachable, with lemon-lime aromas leading to an easy, mildly crisp palate with lemon, lime and honeydew flavors. Sweet in accordance with standard extra dry guidelines, and also good for apéritifs and sparkling cocktails.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Apple, spearmint, mixed greens and citrus carry the bouquet to a firm palate with dry papaya, lemon and herb flavors. Finishes with apple, lemon and bitterness. Very basic and quaffable, but nothing extraordinary.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Opens with funky aromas of sweaty leather and cheese that seem rustic for this bodega. Time and airing help the wine plenty, and sooner rather than later it shows typical Rioja dried red fruits, earth, tobacco and spice. Astringent and tight as a drum now, but it will evolve in the bottle and should last another two decades. Not the best Sierra Cantabria high-end wine I've tried but still shows excellence once it finds its stride. Drink from 2015–2025.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little raisiny, but it's also very nice for a sun-drenched Tempranillo that's deep, lush, extracted and ready to drink. Flavors of brown sugar, spice and sweet blackberry are ready, while the finish offers fudge and more brown sugar. Doesn't have a long follow-through but it's still a dandy modern wine for the near term.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big, toasty, spicy and loaded with savory berry aromas, smoke and density. The palate is weighty and saturated, but balanced. Flavorwise, it's dealing sweet, jammy, slightly roasted black fruit tastes that are followed by a spicy, toasty, coffee-driven finish. Meaty and ripe; drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Almond and mineral accents aid the nose on this fuller-bodied Godello that offers polished apple and peach flavors, a refined and complex mouthfeel and a long finish. Delivers quality for the price, so the value quotient is high.",Spain,Godello
"Zesty and clean, with pure grapefruit and passion fruit aromas. It's charged up but perfectly balanced, with bright, focused citrus and pineapple flavors. Lemony acidity keeps the finish rolling, then throw in some chive and fresh greens and you have a spot-on Verdejo.",Spain,Verdejo
"This is an unusual white blend from Mallorca that uses the native Premsal grape along with 15% Muscat. It smells a little funky and sweaty, and while the feel is angular the palate isn't bad. Tastes sort of fruitless, with a bit of green melon. O.K. for a weird wine, but it's hollow and short on flavor.",Spain,White Blend
"Sweet, candied, minty and easygoing on the nose, then crisp and fresh in the mouth, with basic, stripped-down plum, berry and citrus flavors. Finishes fruity and fresh, with a mild candied sweetness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rustic, flat and chemical at first, with offsetting caramel sweetness to the nose. The palate is big and dark, with herbal, candied flavors and a peppery, creamy finish. Not the most pure wine to process but for 85% Alicante Bouschet it's not bad and seems to get better in the glass.",Spain,Red Blend
"A big, jammy youngster with earth and rubber on the nose. Firm, bullish and tannic but also lively, dark-fruited and touched up with bacon. Finishes with heat and bitterness. Meaty and rugged yet still pretty good.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A good effort from a weak vintage. This Bierzo has sweet, rich, fulfilling aromas along with a soothing palate that's not overly acidic. As a whole, the wine's cola and blackberry flavors show themselves nicely, while the finish is chocolaty and long. A good wine from a sketchy year.",Spain,Mencía
"Granular, edgy and minerally like a daily vitamin tab, this is a sharp-sided white wine with cleansing pineapple, nectarine and lemony flavors in front of a high-toned, mineral-laden finish that is clean and tight. Very fresh, lively and a little more narrow than in the past.",Spain,Godello
"Electric pink in color, this is a touch sweaty and funky on the nose, with a prickly quality. Since it hails from Ribera del Duero, it's no surprise that it's fairly full in body. Flavors of nectarine and candied red fruits finish grabby and a touch bitter.",Spain,Rosé
"Apple, peach and white-flower aromas later suggest dilute pool water. The wine is is tangy and high in malic acid. Sour apple and mixed green-herb flavors finish tart, shear and tangy, with minimal fruit flavor but good crispness.",Spain,Viura
"Sweet and ripe smelling, with licorice and black cherry on the nose. The mouthfeel has a slight astringency to it, but the overall emphasis seems to be on red fruit so that narrowness works. Fresh, quenching and seemingly made to go with foods such as chorizo or fatty Spanish ham. 900 cases made. Imported by Vino Cava.",Spain,Red Blend
"With its light leafy aromas and spice notes, this wine takes you back to another era in Rioja. It offers traditional flavors of tomato, nectarine peel and raspberry on a dry, juicy palate. Nothing special but perfectly good for fans of classic everyday Rioja wines. Imported by Admiral Imports. Best Buy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sort of generic and oily on the nose, with white-fruit aromas that don't fully register. The palate is both spongy and spritzy, with dry, soft flavors of melon and papaya. More fluffy and lush than zesty and precise.",Spain,Verdejo
"Waxy on the nose, with buttercup, creamy yellow-fruit scents and white flowers. The palate is wet, racy and a touch like soda, with sweet, candied flavors of peach and melon. Plods along with good enough acidity to support the wine's core sweetness and candied qualities.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Starts with distinct, hard aromas of mustard, horseradish and jerky. In the mouth, it's full, bullish and tannic, with flavors of bacon, wood resin, smoke and stewed blackberry. Very smoky and dark, with hard tannins, and just not as good as past vintages.",Spain,Merlot
"Unusual in that this cava hails from the Ribera del Duero region, where red wines are 99.9% of the show. For a no-dosage nature, it's properly crisp and dry, almost like a liquid version of a soda cracker. There are some holes in the fabric but overall it's citrusy, tight and only mildly bitter on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Bold, forward and extracted red wine, with raspberry, earth, compost and a light leafiness to the nose. Tannic and tight, with plum and heavy, ripe berry flavors. Toasty and dark on the finish too, with power and freshness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Simply delicious as refreshing, no-oak white wines go. There's telltale grapefruit and stony aromas in front of a pure, easygoing palate endowed with grapefruit, passion fruit and tangerine flavors. Still, it's not overly citric or one-dimensional; excellent Verdejo with a little extra in terms of refinement.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dense and roasted on the nose, with tobacco, leather, mild herbal notes and blackberry fruit. The palate is packed but a little bulky, with smacking flavors of plum, blackberry, pepper and herbs. Finishes with leather and heat. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"One's level of passion for this bulky, hefty Mencía will be largely based on one's appreciation and/or acceptance of heavy oak. The nose is pure hickory, molasses, mocha and coffee, while the chewy, ripe palate deals clove, flowery notes and blueberry flavors. Finishes big and broad, with bacon and barrel resin. Beefy and from the barrel as much as the vineyard; drink now through 2015.",Spain,Mencía
"Very clean and clear, and even though it's a 2009 it is still holding onto its core freshness and character. White fruits and flower blossoms work the nose, and the palate is now fully mature, elegant and smooth. Flavors of peach, melon and kiwi are clean and tasty. Albariño at its best.",Spain,Albariño
"Spearmint, bramble and tomato aromas give this wine a mature bouquet. The palate is wide and shows standard leather, berry and tobacco flavors. But it's also a bit tannic, with chocolate, coffee and a grabby feel working the finish. Pleasant and good as a whole, but by no means an overachiever.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A greeting of toasted nuts and toffee is lifted and sweet, and the palate is quite sweet, with orange marmalade and cinnamon-infused syrup flavors. The finish teeters on cloying as it packs a sweet punch, but there's enough acidity to keep it moving along. Best if you like sweet Sherry.",Spain,Sherry
"Sweet with brown-sugar aromas, but the nose lacks more than that. Citrus and other sweet aromas are solid but common, while the feel is good and the finish brings back brown sugar and mocha. Standard; not designed for complexity.",Spain,Sherry
"Hard and closed on the nose, but if you dig there's saturated yet generic dark-fruit aromas and a touch of creamy, lactic oak. The palate offers thick berry flavors and tomato, while the finish is beefy and chewy, with no shortage of tannins. Colorful and bold, but short on polish and expressiveness.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dark and baked on the nose, with rubbery aromas. Strong, strapping and tannic Tempranillo with roasted black fruit flavors and herbal shadings. A rough, tough style with heat and black coffee on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells like air freshener and white flowers. The palate is spongey and a bit low on life, while the flavors lean toward citrus but lack purity and zap, which is further drilled in on the waxy finish. Once upon a time Basa was a leading white value from Spain; lately it has been average at best.",Spain,White Blend
"Opens with pasty, oaky aromas and very little fruit or clarity. The palate is flat in feel and thick, with woody, medicinal flavors. Finishes with a pile of woodspice and not a whole lot else. Generic and uninspired for the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light on fruit but loaded with mocha and milk chocolate aromas. The palate is lean to average in feel and lightly stewed tasting, with creamy, soupy red berry flavors as the backdrop. Finishes with a persistent baked   flavor and a final dollop of milk chocolate.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Melon, peach and vanilla-cookie aromas are simple and easy. This is plump in feel but bland on the tongue. Flavors of stone fruits are modest, while the finish lumbers along and lingers with a touch of peach.",Spain,Viura-Chardonnay
"A little old school with its dill and vanilla aromas and flavors, but with leather, raisin and berry accents and a nice medium-deep body, it more than gets the job done. The palate features herbal plum and berry flavors, while the finish is a bit short on fruit and long on dill. Improves with airing; drink now. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Nice and friendly but also a little flatter than in years past. Aromas of lemon blossom, peach and other white fruits are standard, while the palate is less than edgy, with creamy apple, melon and spun sugar flavors. Sweet and solid, but on the softer side. Drink right away. Imported by Republic National Distributing Co..",Spain,Albariño
"The Crespiello grape isn't one you see often, but it yields a deep, dark style of wine with balsamic notes, fresh black-fruit flavors and weight. This one is almost on the side of cooked, but not quite, thus it blazes a path with blackberry, smoked meat, jerky spice and more. A touch flat but not flabby.",Spain,Crespiello
"Heavy, dark, candied and jammy, with a hint of licorice to the nose. The palate is chunky and concentrated, with meaty berry flavors and a dose of chocolate. Short on the finish, yet fruity if a bit flat.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Full, dark and dense, with blackberry, molasses and bacon on the nose. At first it seems modern and new-wave, but the palate isn't fat and overextracted; instead it's zesty, vibrant and deals pugnacious blackberry flavors topped with spice and chocolate. A lively, forward but manageable wine to drink now through 2014. Only 416 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Quite impressive and eyebrow raising for Graciano. The nose is smoky and dry, with raspberry and bacon. In the mouth, acidity is controlled and thus there's no sourness to the plum, tomato, spice and vanilla flavors. Finishes with verve and elegance; a nice potential partner for just about any food. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Graciano
"Heavy, oily and well oaked, but also elegant, elevated and something out of the ordinary. This is barrel-fermented Viura at a high quality level; it's smooth, creamy and lifted but also acid-rich and lemony, with notes of toast, vanilla, melon and wood resin. A potentially fine wine to drink now with baked or sautéed fish.",Spain,White Blend
"Unlike TG's Abadía de San Campio Albariño, this wine also features Loureira and Caiño Blanco, and it's more interesting in the long run. Aromas of mango and pineapple are sweet and pungent, while the palate is round, leesy and plump, with green melon, apple, vanilla and creamy notes. Fleshy on the finish, but with good acidity. Will accompany shellfish of all sorts.",Spain,White Blend
"Bulky, dark, saturated and leathery on the nose, and then a little salty and edgy in the mouth, with a streak of zingy acidity along with roasted, tangy, thick blackberry flavors. Really good for the price but not as expressive, ripe and flavorful as the 2007 Salia or the higher-end Finca Sandoval; drink now through 2014.",Spain,Red Blend
"Opens with alluring, classic aromas of spice, cinnamon, leather, vanilla and tomato along with raspberry. The palate is firm, healthy and dry, with tea, baked berry, dill and cinnamon flavors. Aged six months in American oak, this is a textbook Rioja crianza that's smooth, herbal and on the money.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Prieto Picudo is the grape here, and it's not your run-of-the-mill red variety. The nose is minty green and rustic, and you can tell it's not cut from a common cloth. In the mouth, Carroleon shows cassis and carob, while the finish has chocolate and a medicinal essence. Top-heavy in terms of concentration, with a thin middle tier.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"Floral at the edges but dense in the middle, this 920-case wine offers balsam wood, leather and lemon peel aromas in front of sweet, almost sticky cherry and plum flavors. There's wood and resin on the palate, while the feel is saturated and almost candied. A very rich and modern type of Monastrell that should be drunk soon.",Spain,Monastrell
"A good little wine but proof that not all finos are made equally. Pedro Romero is light as day, with almondy aromas and a touch of flower blossom on the nose. The palate is wet, a little thin and entirely basic, with white peach, pepper and a touch of mushroom.",Spain,Sherry
"Mature and sound on the bouquet, but more snappy and sharp overall than you might anticipate for a 2001. Aromas of tobacco and bramble lead to flavors that you'd expect: more tobacco, dried plum, sour cherries, etc. Long and lean on the palate and finish, with pulse but a shortage of richness. It leaves you wanting more body and fruit.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Despite the high price and small quantity (125 cases total), this wine is not performing at an optimal level. The nose, based on 32 months in oak, is drying and minty, with more dill and leather than fruit. The palate, meanwhile, is sharp and elevated by acidity, while the flavors are of tart fruit, tobacco and vanilla. Best with food; drink now because it's not going to improve.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Smells roasted and stemmy, with a burnt leaf and turned earth quality to the bouquet. Herbal, scratchy berry and plum flavors feel rough and don't exhibit enough freshness. Simply put: it's a leafy, muddled Ribera wine.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Mealy and heavy smelling, but with decent background fruit aromas and sweetness. Frankly, this already seems to be past its prime, evidenced by creamy, flat flavors of bland fruit and caramel. The finish needs snap and crispness but doesn't have any; a bit too sweet, candied and bitter already.",Spain,Rosé
"Heavy and nutty, almost like movie popcorn. In due time the nose transitions to creamy berry and cranberry. The palate is soft and muddled, with some citrus and red apple. Sweet and tomatoey on the finish; needs more focus, acidity and dryness.",Spain,Rosé
"A bit sharp, stemmy and sour smelling. But the fruit flavors are solid and the herbal cherry and plum character that leads the palate improves with airing. Herbal on the finish; standard as a whole.",Spain,Monastrell-Syrah
"This warm-climate Viura hits with plodding barrel aromas and flavors but there's not a lot of high-quality natural material to support that much faux/forced oak. Along the way it hints at mealy apple, spice, cinnamon powder and resin. A lot of noise but not much music.",Spain,Viura
"In this very basic wine, applesauce aromas are followed by a plump, somewhat citrusy feeling palate. Flavors of nectarine are good and clean, while the finish is solid.",Spain,White Blend
"The nose is blowsy and dusty, with waxy white-fruit aromas. The palate is juicy and fresh but doesn't offer much body. Finishing flavors of nectarine, papaya and orange are basic.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Good wine from a very hot year. Early aromas of Band-Aid and barnyard fade with airing, and then forest floor and black fruit step in. The palate is expressive and tasty, with solid blackberry, tea and herbal flavors. Finishes dry, with mocha and chocolate. Drink now. Imported by Vino Cava.",Spain,Red Blend
"Apparently the allure of Rioja proved too great for the Torres family, because now they have a wine from Spain's signature region. Ibéricos is dark and fruity, with exotic perfume notes and also some soupy qualities. The flavors of strawberry and raspberry have a thick creamy accent, while vanilla and dill are prominent on the finish. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light on the nose, with dilute red-berry aromas and mild leathery, cheesy notes. The palate is kind of raw and lean, with tangy, crisp flavors of pie cherry and raspberry. Dry, peppery, snappy wine, with definitive crispness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pale and low on bead, but if you like a Moscato-style wine, this isn't bad at all. The palate is sweet, fleshy and smooth, with lychee and melon flavors. Lively but easy on the finish, with a final wave of lychee fruit and Malvasia-driven sweetness. Unusual but pretty good.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Floral fragrances from the Gewürztraminer come with honey and leesy aromas. The mouthfeel is creamy and oily, and next up is a melony flavor profile and a smooth finish. Mild on the acidity, so it's in top form now. An exotic, intriguing blend of Gewürz and Macabeo with character; 1,100 cases made.",Spain,White Blend
"Smoky, dark, bold and full of black fruit aromas along with barrel notes and a lemony accent. For Prieto Picudo, this is clean, decidedly not funky and lush, with blackberry, spice and barrel resin. Finishes bacony and rich, but not fat or heavy; drink this year and next.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"Can't call it floral and bright on the nose, but it's not over the hill or maderized, either; more neutral than anything. The mouth is fresh, lively and loaded with lime, green apple and length. Approaching peak maturity and then will start to fade. A smooth operator with depth, minerality and fine acidity.",Spain,Albariño
"Nice and fragrant, with citrus and passion fruit at the heart of the zesty bouquet. Still fresh courtesy of core acidity, with green melon, passion fruit, grapefruit and citrus flavors. Right now it's showing the right blend of maturity and liveliness; a fine Verdejo that may be benefitting from 5% Sauvignon Blanc. Drink this year.",Spain,Verdejo
"Creamy and powdery on the nose, with sweetness and leesy notes. The palate is round, smooth and not terribly cutting, while the flavors lean toward honey, melon and another shot of lees. Finishes long and classy, with elegance. Drink immediately before it loses its vitality.",Spain,Albariño
"Rich, warm, earthy and fully oaked, with mocha, molasses, blackberry and bacon aromas. The palate is huge but balanced, with clear, ripe black fruit, caramel and vanilla flavors. Modern and chunky but with flow and character; a winner for the price, with a toasty, mocha-driven finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Overt on the nose, with a wave of mint, dill and vanilla that come straight from the barrel. Game and leather notes come up later, leading to a palate that blends berry flavors with savory sauciness. Finishing accents of tomato leaf and herbs seal this wine as truly Navarran in character.",Spain,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Light and rather floral for a Monastrell, with cassis, cherry and leather aromas. It's mildly brambly and not as deep as the 2006 version. Tastes like blackberry and leather, while the tannic grab is strapping. Finishes with a hint of spice and herbs, but also a pinch of bitterness.",Spain,Monastrell
"Blackberry, plum and earth scents give this wine a darker bouquet than most entry- level 2007 Riojas. It remains solid and full in the mouth, with blackberry, dark plum and charred flavors. Medium length to the finish, with accents of cola and pepper. Good for the vintage; a cut above your everyday Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Heavy aromas of orange marmalade and honey come across as unconvincing. The palate follows suit with bland, soft, chubby cantaloupe and green melon flavors. Finishes soft and dilute; seems like it's already dying in the bottle.",Spain,Verdejo
"Rough and leathery, with roasted black fruit and burnt-leaf aromas. The palate has a clacky, sharp feel and flavors of dried, baked berry fruits and leaves. Hard, roasted and leathery red wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lean raspberry and cherry aromas are the best part because the palate is rather raw and acidic, which causes raspiness and a tough mouthfeel. Flavors are sharp and red fruited, and there's an oak and vanilla element that's not that well integrated.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Expensive for what you get. The nose is a weird mix of salami and sweetness, and the palate is a syrupy, globular blend of cloying oak, caramel syrup and candied banana. Way too much wood and vanilla here, and not nearly enough balance or purity.",Spain,White Blend
"Smells lightly burnt and acrid, with stemmy berry aromas, apricot and match stick. The palate has a flat, creamy feel and stemmy, dry flavors of generic berry and bitterness. Too flat and devoid of fruit to rate higher.",Spain,Rosé
"Sharp, rubbery, stemmy aromas lead to an edgy palate with herbal, burnt, semigreen berry flavors. Finishes green and a bit weedy; acceptable but nothing to get excited over.",Spain,Monastrell
"Aromas of saline, oily white fruits and swimming pool unfold on the nose. This feels oily and tastes pickled, with bitter notes, green herbs and mild stone-fruit flavors. The gripping finish tastes pithy.",Spain,Verdejo
"Pungent, sweaty aromas of nettle and cactus suggest capsicum. Citric in feel, the palate offers grapefruit and mild bell pepper flavors. This is Tempranillo with 20% Verdejo.",Spain,Rosado
"An interesting if not exactly perfect Cab Franc from central Spain. It has some of the grape's typical leafy dampness but in the mouth the wine is bright and brutally tannic, with blackberry, plum and cassis flavors. Ripe, chewy and meaty, with plenty of power and fruit but not a ton of finesse.",Spain,Cabernet Franc
"Lively right off the bat but also sort of jumbled and cheesy. The palate features red-fruit flavors and candy, while the finish is aggressively racy and a bit raw. A natural, expressive wine but one that's grabby and edgy as well. Needs both time in the glass and food to show best.",Spain,Cabernet Franc-Tempranillo
"Dusty and floral on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas and a touch of nut oil. A blend of 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura that is wet, fresh and healthy. Tastes of fresh tropical fruits and finishes with good acidity and control. There's even a slight spritz to the mouthfeel. Imported by Testa Wines Of The World. Best Buy.",Spain,White Blend
"Floral, earthy, funky and barnyardy, with all the young exuberance that comes with joven/roble wines from RDD. Lots of color, power, tannins and extract along with young, sweet, chewy black-fruit flavors and tart acidity to the palate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hot earth, baked cherry and mild vanilla aromas come in front of a snappy, angular palate with tangy pie-cherry and red-plum flavors. Sheer and basic Rioja with high acidity, lean fruit, a cleansing finish and a light body.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells oily and a little burnt and acrid, with fleshy flavors of banana, melon and bitter pith. Has some verve but mostly it's an average wine with some bitterness and dry orange peel and pith. Decent but offers nothing beyond.",Spain,Verdejo
"Lively, candied and medicinal, with grassy aromas along with mild animal notes. The palate is young, grabby, forceful but solid, while the flavors are bright, bold, snappy and suggest red plum and black cherry. A basic young wine that's decent if you're not too discerning.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Almondy and smoky on the nose, which is a textbook combo for this variety. The wine was 50% barrel-fermented, but it's not a woody, toasty product. Instead, it's focused and fruity, with a pretty mix of tropical flavors, banana and melon. Decidedly not bitter, with honey and light notes of vanilla on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Smoky and dark, with aromas of salami, rubber, baking spices and prune. In the mouth, it's full of brightening acids while the flavors of blackberry, black cherry and coffee yield to raisin and burnt toast on the finish. Very nice Rioja but with a touch of excess ripeness and raisin character.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A lively and impressive Viura with classic freshness and dry qualities that push it along a level plane. The nose is all apple and pear, while the palate brings kick and tasty flavors of apple and dry spice. Smooth, juicy and ripe on the finish. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Viura
"Starts out a bit rough and horsey, but let it air out and escape from the bottle and this Tempranillo-Cabernet blend struts its stuff. There's impressive core blackberry and raspberry flavors along with minerality, crustiness and structure. Tight on the finish and still youthful, with rugged tannins and power to spare. Very nice for a 65,000-case product.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark to the eye, with bacon, ham, spice and savory fruit aromas. The palate is extracted and grating in feel, with dark berry, herb, pepper, smoke and barrel resin flavors. Spicy on the finish, with a blast of clove and cardamom. Very good but not as filled out as in prior years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Superclean and inviting on the nose, with lemon, melon, apple and stony aromas. The palate has a round, pleasant, chiseled feel and flavors of green fruits including kiwi, honeydew melon and apple. Turns a bit sweet on the finish, but not sugary. Really nice for $15 Spanish Chardonnay.",Spain,Chardonnay
"A mixture of celery root and sweetness makes the nose a little confusing. The wine is typically acidic, with simple mushroom and salinic flavors. Distant on the finish, with some blocky heft. Not quite as smooth, simple and easygoing as a manzanilla should be.",Spain,Sherry
"Intense and frisky, with mild green-herbal aromas standing out on the nose. Like any varietal Graciano, the wine is shrill, with acidity pushing the tart side of the huckleberry and blueberry fruit. Lean at the end, with little richness. Best for die-hard Rioja buffs and fans of acidic red wines.",Spain,Graciano
"Light spice notes and jammy berry aromas are about all you get from this Prieto Picudo-based wine. The palate is sheering in feel, with cherry, plum and apple skin flavors. Just weighty enough, with a juicy profile and finishing flavors of cola and lean red fruits. Drink now.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"It's cheesy on the nose at first, with black fruit, molasses and leather coming later. Baked and warm on the palate, and then loud due to a heavy mouthfeel and a strong raisiny quality. Rich, sweet, wayward and incongruent. Has its moments and also its pitfalls.",Spain,Red Blend
"Woodsy at first, then more foresty and stretched. The nose is peppery and light on fruit, while the palate shows tight cherry and raspberry flavors alongside edgy, invigorating tannins and acidity. A lively wine with bite and modest offsetting sweetness to the overriding snap.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"All indigenous grapes are welcomed by our tasting panel, but sometimes they are unknown and little used for a reason. This wine, made from the local Maturana Tinta, is a green, mean, lean wine with herbal aromas and flavors that, let's face it, are vegetal. Tastes tart and short, with a strong, driving green character throughout.",Spain,Maturana
"Dusty, sweet and gummy on the nose, and not very vital. The palate is chunky and dull, with mealy white fruit flavors and a bit of fino sherry or manzanilla. Made from the Malvar grape, and the result is strange and lazy.",Spain,Malvar
"Raisiny and thin smelling at the same time. The palate is dilute, citric and sheering, with tangy red currant and citrus flavors. Acidity keeps it vital but there's little flavor, body and structure. Ends up thin and sour.",Spain,Red Blend
"Smells like mealy fruit and bananas, while the palate is weak in constitution and a bit spritzy in feel. Tastes like bland white fruits with vanilla. Cloying on the finish.",Spain,Malvasia
"There's a reason Airén is used as a base grape for brandy and Sherry wines, and it's because it's not up to table-wine quality, even at the value price point. This wine is corny and lacks freshness. It's dull, wayward and offers little to no structure. Barely drinkable.",Spain,Airen
Smells like fruit juice. Overall it's raisiny and pruney. Drinkable but barely. Doesn't bring clarity or proper balance.,Spain,Tempranillo
"This is maderized in color and slightly oxidized, with clumsy aromas of peach, apple and sweat. Citric acid is about all that's propping up the palate, while flavors of nutty, oxidized stone fruits and citrus finish similarly.",Spain,Viura
"Briny aromas of gooseberry and citrus are a touch sweaty. In the mouth, this is medium in weight. Flavors of briny grapefruit and other citrus fruits finish similarly. The blend is 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Tempranillo.",Spain,Rosé
"Aromas of warm radiator dust and lightly toasted peach and apple come in front of a plump, peachy palate with candied orange and nectarine flavors. The finish is blocky in feel and short in length, with creamy sweetness.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Buttercup aromas are peachy and yeasty. Although the wine offers adequate freshness, it is starting to lose clarity. Flavors of dull peach finish nutty and slightly oxidized.",Spain,Viura
"Pickled, briny aromas come up short and the palate is snappy but not well defined. Flavors of bitter citrus finish equally pithy.",Spain,Verdejo
White-flower aromas and little more define the nose on this bland wine from hot Jumilla. A flabby mouthfeel sets up green banana and pyrazine-based flavors. Papaya is the only discernible flavor note on an otherwise soft and creamy finish.,Spain,White Blend
"This strange, floral-smelling Chard seems more like Gewürztraminer. It's creamy and cloying in the mouth, with spicy, sweet flavors of anise and lychee. It's particular and unique, but not very good.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Sweet black fruit, road tar and a whiff of grass makes for an interesting, attractive nose. With its medium body and medium depth, the palate shows cherry, cassis and tomato flavors, and the finish offers a rush of red fruit, tannin and brown sugar. While this doesn't bowl you over, it's good Spanish Cabernet Sauvignon, something you don't find every day.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This warm-vintage crianza has earthy black-cherry aromas along with leather, mineral and bacon. The palate is tight, with tanninc grip and narrow but tasty cherry, plum and dry herbal flavors. A savory wine with attributes and good charisma. Drink now. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"There's no shortage of power here. Forward berry aromas mixed with earth and leather ring true, while the palate is layered, broad, chewy and offers bright cherry and plum flavors. It dries out well on the finish, leaving tasty notes of pepper and herbs. From the Granada area.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nothing wrong with this crisp, tight number from Rioja. It's so clear in color that it's almost translucent, but the palate has good flavors of kiwi, green melon and lime. Precise on the tongue, with a chalky scour to the finish. It's your basic white Rioja done right. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd. Best Buy.",Spain,Viura
"Dark and deep, with cola, black fruit and truffle aromas. There's good lift to the palate, but overall it has to be classified as a dense, warm-climate wine with a big body and equally large flavors of black plum, olive and coffee. Seems short and a little simple on the finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"A bit rubbery and smoky on the nose, with some hardness. Airing reveals raspberry and vanilla aromas, while the palate carries some jolt due to sizable acids. Tastes like a burst of red plum and pie cherry, while the finish is tannic, long and full of leftover red fruit. More than respectable for La Mancha Syrah. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Spain,Syrah
"A bit flat and jammy on the nose, and then it runs hot and heavy across the palate, where the flavors waver between citric and plum-cherry. There's a lot of fruit here, but also some burn and finally a dull hum to the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Earthy but sharp on the nose, with a foreboding sense of stem and sourness. The palate is indeed raw and acidic, with lean, slightly stemmy flavors of herbs, raspberry and plum. Not bad but carries a stemmy, less-than-pure personality.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A rubbery, minty, jammy wine, with a mildly candied, gummy feel and sweet, modest, lightly green flavors that suggest red fruits. The finish is decent but herbal and sweet.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with vanilla and minerality along with standard apple and peach aromas. It's a bit darker and more tan in color than what you'd expect, with fine acidity and integration throughout. Shows touches of white pepper, nutmeg and dried papaya on a classy finish. Dry and subtle at all points.",Spain,Albariño
"Clean and pure on the nose, with popping apple and green melon aromas. The palate has a linear, crystal-clean feel along with fresh flavors of lime, lettuce and gooseberry. Super crisp, snappy and polished; a live-wire, citrusy specimen perfect for summer sipping.",Spain,Verdejo
"Clean, minerally and smooth, with nothing more than crispness and apple to the nose. The palate is easygoing, while the flavors of peach, pear and apple are boosted by minerality and good acidity. A highly likable, drinkable wine that shows that Galician quality extends beyond Albariño and Rías Baixas. Made from 70% Godello with Treixadura and Albariño. Drink now.",Spain,White Blend
"Floral and lightly tropical on the nose, and totally pleasant. The palate is pure and lively, with elegance and some spritz. Flavors of nectarine, peach and melon are fresh, and the wine finishes easy and smooth. Very nice; just short of excellent but still it's 100% quaffable.",Spain,Albariño
"Easy, chiseled and refreshing stuff from Catalonia that's 50% Macabeo and 50% Sauvignon Blanc, by no means a common combo in Spain. Aromas of lime are clean, while the palate locks in on orange and grapefruit flavors with perfect acidity. Delightful salad and appetizer wine.",Spain,White Blend
"Earth and leather aromas bring depth to a nose defined by raspberry and other red fruits. The mouth is narrow but perfectly clean, with sassy berry and pepper flavors that are standard and cleansing. A simple wine that delivers what it should.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Licorice and other sweet, dark, unusual aromas set this Syrah on its way. Flavors of raisin and fig tell you that it's ripe, but the mouthfeel is controlled by sharp, wayward acidity. Finishes with additional licorice and cooked caramel flavors, and as a whole it lacks some balance and a game plan.",Spain,Syrah
"A nose of sweet cherries and raspberry is limited due to some damp funk, but with time the wine shows unimpeded freshness and pretty good blackberry flavors. It's modestly lush, with a controlled mouthfeel and a mild, balanced finish. Fresh, tasty and uncomplicated.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This unusual blend of Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is a bit strange, but it gets our attention for being unique. The nose is ripe and medicinal, with spearmint, carob, vanilla, berry and candy aromas. In the mouth, it's big and creamy, with sweet, sticky black-fruit flavors and a spread of butter. Not a great wine, but good for the region of Valencia.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fairly obvious vanilla and dill aromas work with red-fruit and resin scents to give this a “roble” sort of nose, meaning the oak is definitely there. (Roble is the word for oak in Spanish.) In the mouth, cherry, plum and pasty lactic flavors integrate the more you swirl, while the finish is toasty and dark, with another wave of oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This opens with oxidized, creamy aromas while the palate offers mostly acidic, tart citrus flavors that are surrounded by oxidized stone-fruit notes. The finish ends nutty.",Spain,Viura
"Apple aromas are mild and innocuous. This feels wide, chunky and without definition. Flavors of pithy white fruits turn bitter and briny on the finish.",Spain,Viura
"Light apple-blossom aromas are harmless. In the mouth, this Chardonnay-based blend is flat and buttery in feel, with baked apple and peach flavors before a flat finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Chunky aromas are lacking in fruit. The palate feels pithy and citric, while pyrazines and bland citrus drive the flavor profile on this Verdejo-Viura blend that's past its prime.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Floral and yeasty on the nose, but not fruity or interesting, this wine is on the fade. The mouthfeel is heavy and flat, while peachy, melony flavors finish bready.",Spain,Verdejo
"Stalky and oxidized on the nose, this becomes cidery, high in acid in the mouth, with sour-lemon flavors.",Spain,Chardonnay
"This yellow-colored blend is weird and wooly, with aromas of blowsy apricot and herbs. A pulpy, melony palate is creamy and odd in feel, with nectarine and chunky peach flavors that turn rubbery on the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Always consistent is Blanco Nieva's Verdejo. The nose is clean and inviting, with apple and pineapple aromas. The palate is full and fruity, with a zesty set of flavors that include nectarine, orange and mango. Clean and smooth on the finish, and maybe a touch sweet. Drink now. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Verdejo
"This wine impressed us more now than when we tried it last year. It is showing commendable intensity and concentration, and while it seems slightly medicinal, it brings on the plum and baked-fruit flavors. Probably a bit more heavy and mushy than ideal, but we like the wine's ripeness and dark flavors.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc
"Sweet and fragrant, with off-the-grid aromas of blueberry and exotic spice. It's 50% Monastrell along with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Tempranillo, and overall the wine has healthy acids, a hot finish and spicy flavors of brandied cherry and plum. Thick and substantive, but a little fiery.",Spain,Red Blend
"A bit tan and dull to the eye, with neutral aromas of apple cider and peach. The palate is wet, uncomplicated and simple, with basic apple flavors that some might consider to be bland. Solid on the finish, with papaya for flavor.",Spain,Viura-Chardonnay
"For a bargain-priced red, this is not bad. The nose is baked and mellow, with a whiff of barnyard. It's robust and warm on the palate, with chunky blackberry flavors and an herbal essence at the core. Foresty on the finish, yet a little flat. Good for basic wine.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"A mix of raisiny aromas and grass notes gives this wine a green sort of bouquet. The palate is chunky, with thick berry and plum flavors that are good if not put under the microscope. More voluminous than precise, with big tannins and a “country” sort of personality, meaning it's fruity and big but not that refined.",Spain,Mencía
"A true but basic Rioja with chewing gum and dark fruits to the nose. It's the acid that grabs you hardest as it hits the palate, while the flavors run toward cherry, sour plum and a nip of cassis. Solid but short on the finish, with pepper and tang.",Spain,Tempranillo
"If you catch this before it fades, it won't be a bad little Catalunyan rosé. The nose if fresh and redolent of strawberry, cherry and pepper, while the palate is simple, narrow and tastes of plum, cherry tomato and raspberry. Clean and decent on its best day. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Rosé
"Raspberry and citrus peel aromas lead to a stark palate of red fruit and citrus flavors. This is a lip-smacking, acid-driven wine with minor hints of toast and coffee on the finish. Limited in what it has to offer, but good for what it is.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with tart rhubarb and animal aromas and later it shows fennel and cured meat scents. The palate is fresh and tart, with sassy raspberry, plum and other short-lived red-fruit flavors. Honest and clean, but limited in what it brings to the table.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Edgy cherry and raspberry aromas carry a bit of rhubarby sharpness, while the palate is bright, clangy and simple. This is a fresh, no-fuss wine that pulls no punches. It's raw and slightly brambly, with decent integrity and no tricks up its sleeve.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rather stemmy on the nose for a $50 wine, while the palate is sheering and firm as nails, with licorice and a forced sweetness that starts as blackberry and turns to licorice. With raisin, brandy and anisette flavors driving everything, you better like sweet, liqueur-like drinks if you're going to fall for this one.",Spain,Red Blend
"A little prickly and sharp on the nose, with cherry, raspberry and piney aromas. The palate is racy, healthy and solid, with wild herb notes giving character to more basic but ripe blackberry and oak-based coffee flavors. Finishes long and whole, with a final dusting of dried herbs.",Spain,Mencía
"Dry, almondy and mature, with oxidized aromas and a bold gold color. This is full-force white Garnacha with a lot of heft and body. It's arguably more bitter and sweet than outright fruity, with honey and white pepper accents. Finishes extra spicy, with heat. Rich and heady stuff to drink now.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Full and dark, with a bouquet that offers hints of cheese, rubber and stocky black fruit. The palate is big, layered and grinds a bit due to rugged tannins and lively acidity. But the flavors of roasted berry and sweet spice work well, and the finish is savory and healthy. A little biting but still nice.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Expensive for what is ultimately a crisp, clean but limited white wine from the Basque country. The palate is juicy due to high acidity, while the flavors of lemon and green apple are tight. Finishes firm and driving, with a touch of cidery sweetness.",Spain,White Blend
"Not all that pointed on the nose, but shows good depth and peak maturity in the mouth. The palate is fleshy and dry, with melon and peach flavors and just enough acidity to keep it lively. Finishes dry and clean, with a spot of pithy bitterness that's not unusual for Verdejo. Nice but definitely drink soon.",Spain,Verdejo
"Smoky berry, lemon peel, graphite and huge black-fruit aromas provide a stellar opening. Raw tannins and staunchness create a powerful palate that needs time to mellow out. Flavors of loud oak, black fruits, hard spices, toast and licorice finish peppery, tough and with some heat. Best from 2015–2023.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Never a bad buy and almost always a Best Buy, this Viura from Cáceres impresses via its clean, stony nose and pure nectarine, apple and citrus flavors. It isn't complex, but by the same token it isn't candied, artificial or phony. One of our perennial favorites among value-priced white wines. Imported by Vineyard Brands. Best Buy.",Spain,White Blend
"Dark, sweet and arguably a little raisiny on the nose. That sweetness translates into a thick mouthfeel cemented by weight and a tannic grip. The flavor profile is moderately baked, with berry, chocolate and molasses flavors, while the finish is long but tastes a touch cooked. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A full and good wine with limits. Opens with fresh, floral aromas and a bit of oak, while the palate seems almost tart at first but then delivers snappy cherry and plum flavors. Acidity and tannin keep it lively on the finish, while overall we find the wine solid and ready to go. A blend of Tempranillo and Merlot.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Starts out murky, gassy and challenged, and while it does emerge from that cloud it remains little more than bargain-priced, borderline Tempranillo from an obscure central Spain region. The palate shows generic, herbal black fruit and the finish is acceptable.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bright and shimmers with purple, while the nose is jumpy and candied, with a lot of sweetness and black fruit. Marginal to tough on the palate, with racy, hard tannins and a clacky feel to go with wild berry and mulchy flavors. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Generally speaking, most Amontillados are good at their worst, but for whatever reason this wine barely makes the grade. It lacks pop on the nose and seems dilute and drab. In the mouth, the flavors strike as sour and sharp, but also musty and weak. With so many fine Sherries available, this one seems like a laggard.",Spain,Palomino
"Strawberry and rhubarb aromas get it going, and frankly that's about as good as it gets. The mouthfeel is so-so. but the flavors are funky and mealy, with a weedy bitterness that doesn't serve the wine well. Lacks purity, focus and persistence. Made from Pinot Noir.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"A strange bird with herbaceous aromas that suggest sage or juniper baking in the summer sun. The palate is acidic and sharp, with green-tinged pie cherry and plum skin flavors. Gritty on the finish, with needling tannins and a final wave of that odd juniper character. 60% Monastell and 40% Petit Verdot.",Spain,Red Blend
"A little sharp and brambly, with aromas of violet, briar patch and rhubarb. It's decidedly racy in the mouth, with cherry and plum flavors that take on a slight candied character. Finishes with red-licorice candy flavors and some bite.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An edgy wine with aromas of fern frond, prickle and celery along with apple cider and citrus. The palate is zesty to the point of being citric, while the flavors are akin to green apple and gooseberry. The Picapoll grape is what it is: citric, narrow and mildly bitter in the end.",Spain,Picapoll
"Fairly stemmy Rioja, with mildly harsh rhubarb and charred red-fruit aromas. Far more tart and narrow than expected, with a reedy burnt-berry flavor profile along with stemmy snap throughout. Given all the great Riojas out there, this one comes up short.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The year 2007 is not going to go down in the books as a good one for Ribera del Duero. Many of the young wines, like this one, are showing narrow, sour fruit and too much funk and pickle. Here, there's a touch of jamminess and red fruit but mostly it's another thin, pushy wine with anemic flavors and a rough mouthfeel. Stick with the 2006 if you can find it.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A sharp, angular number with aromas of pine, vinegar, mocha and leather. The feel is citric and lean, with red-fruit and orange-peel flavors. In the end, it's more thin and sharp than balanced, with a tannic, narrow mouthfeel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe blackberry with dill and vanilla suggest “classic” Rioja, although it's probably more modern than that. The wine features a full body, thick tannins, roasted berry flavors, molasses and a bit of chocolate. Maybe it's a touch baked and overripe, but it's definitely solid and generous. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A subtle wine made entirely from Trepat. Aromas of strawberry and toast are mixed well, while the palate is juicy, crisp and correct, with raspberry and plum flavors along with a dose of dry spice. Light, toasty and perfectly dry on the back end. Nothing spectacular but gets things right.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Light and fluffy aromas of flower blossom and white fruits are simple but do the trick. There's some as-advertised leesy weightiness to the palate and depth, but mostly the wine is just mellow and tasty, with apple and peach flavors.",Spain,Godello
"Hot and roasted on the nose, but still interesting and suggestive of high quality. The palate is very rich and sweet, with candied, ultraripe flavors of berry, fig paste and chocolate. Maintains that sweet, baked character onto the finish, which is mature and soft. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Starts out kind of raw and cutting, with oak, soy and spiky black fruit aromas. The palate is round but features kick, while flavors of cola, mocha and chocolate sit on top of earthy berry. An oaky wine, especially on the finish. But it's also deep and generous. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little foxy at first, with lively, forward aromas of herbs, bramble, wild berry and black cherry. Doesn't take long in the glass to show its qualities, which include structure and plenty of fruit, herbs, pepper and dry spice on the palate. A voluminous, interesting Garnacha to slot into the everyday category.",Spain,Garnacha
"Fans of full-bodied, dark-fruited reds will swoon over this modern-style Garnacha from old vineyards in Aragón. Pitch black, the nose provides a pure blast of blackberry and cassis, and the palate is chewy yet fresh, with baked black-fruit flavors as well as coffee, chocolate and vanilla. A smooth, lush, layered finish with vanilla and toffee notes is the final act. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Garnacha
"With its opaque black color and massive yet alluring aromas of blackberry and black currant, this whopper is on the money. The mouthfeel is lush and pure, while flavors of blackberry, chocolate and baking spices flow easily onto a subtle finish that's neither overly oaky nor weighty. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dense intitial aromas suggest rubber on top of blackberry. In the mouth, this Tempranillo is deep as a trench, with layering and firm tannins. Flavors of toasty oak, blackberry, coconut and herbs dance together like a world-class ballet troupe, while the finish is textured, toasty and loaded with power. Drink from 2015–2021.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Dry and fiery, with leaf and herb aromas going head to head with light raspberry. The palate has some depth and sweetness to it, and at the core it's showing cherry, plum and spice flavors. True to the blueprint of traditional Rioja but not a lot beyond the basics. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"By no means is this an easy wine to like or understand. It begins with murky, earthy aromas and then unfolds to deliver marzipan and sweet berry fruit. Massive is an understatement, as the wine's tannic grab and density are over the top. There aren't many good high-priced Cabs from Spain; take this as a good explanation why not. Imported by Kobrand.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pungent and sweaty smelling, and even though it's 50% Verdejo and 50% Viura, it's the Verdejo that stands out. Fresh and flashy in the mouth, with lively lime, gooseberry and green apple flavors. And the finish is zesty and wet, with plenty of acidity and spritz. Imported by Grapes of Spain. Best Buy.",Spain,White Blend
"The funky blue bottle aside, this is a good, lightweight, clean Viura that shouldn't steer anyone wrong. Nice pear and apple aromas are basic but welcoming, and the tangerine and green apple flavors are crisp and whet the whistle. Best for simple quaffing. Imported by Admiral Imports. Best Buy.",Spain,White Blend
"Darker, denser and more raisiny than your average varietal Graciano, this wine is almost pruney and horsey. But it settles down to offer solid but chunky black plum, prune and balsamic flavors. The finish is stocky but not flabby. Meaty and solid for Graciano. Imported by Baron Francois Ltd.",Spain,Graciano
"Get at this wine while it's still fresh and you'll likely enjoy its pineapple, apple and mango essence. It's a bit plump and oily in terms of feel, but overall it gets things right as it pours on the fresh pineapple on both the palate and   finish. Imported by Luneau USA Inc. Best Buy.",Spain,Verdejo
"Gold in color and short on bubbles, but heavy on sweetness and residual sugar. That said, it's an advertised semidry, so a certain level of cloy is expected. But this tips too far to the sweet side, leaving nothing but refined white sugar, banana and vanilla cream. Not my cup of tea.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Reddish in color and devoid of a visible bubble bead, this Garnacha-Monastrell cava is lacking in many ways. The nose is grassy and ashy, sort of like a spent cigar, and it's cheesy as well. In the mouth, it's fairly bland tasting, with generic, semitart flavors and a sharp finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A fairly unclean wine with leafy cough-drop aromas. The palate is weak and washed out, with stemmy red-fruit flavors. Spiced and leafy on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stemmy and raw smelling; similar in the mouth. The palate is narrow and sheer, while the flavors lean toward tart red cherry and rhubarb. Peppery and underwhelming.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The first 2007 reds from Spain are now appearing, and it seems like talk of a tough vintage are being confirmed. This wine is sheer and miserly. The nose is gaseous, while the flavors of blackberry and spice are seared by sharp, overt acidity. Shrill and not nearly as generous as the '06.",Spain,Mencía
"We suggest very little time with this bulky, medicinal Tempranillo. Despite color and weight, it's prickly, sour and not too ripe. The flavors and finish are short, while the overriding impression is that it's underdeveloped.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Neon pink in color with watermelon and candied raspberry aromas. But from there it goes nowhere; the palate is watery and tart, with sour strawberry and raspberry flavors. Tangy and underdeveloped, it comes across as quick-picked Rioja rosé.",Spain,Rosé
"A tart, foxy style of Rioja with sharp-edged aromas. The palate is crisp as ice chips, with lean, leafy flavors of pie cherry and raspberry. Tight on the finish, with a lasting scratch of peppercorn and acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Harsh and burnt-smelling, with beet-like flavors and too much body weight. One could argue that it gets better as it airs out, but nobody should have to wrestle with a rosé just to get something likable from it. Past its prime with nowhere to go.",Spain,Rosé
"Aromas of cabbage, tomato leaf and green berry fruits tell you all you need to know. The wine is green but thick, with an unctuous meeting of sweet and underripe flavors as well as a gooey mouthfeel. Just one of a million weak wines from the high plains of Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"An aggressive wine with very little charm or character to back up its edgy verve. The nose is skunky while the palate tastes of pickled red cabbage and sharp berry flavors. A weak product reflective of a cool, nongiving vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Eggy, sulfuric and gritty on the nose, with acrid, burnt-field aromas. The palate runs toward grapefruit and bland citrus, and the finish is dull. Barely an acceptable effort given the norm these days.",Spain,Godello
"Murky and dusty, with additional nutty, dirty aromas. Not much to say here; the wine is heavy and battles you all the way. The fruit is muddled and tart, and overall the wine is devoid of character.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A gaseous, barnyardy wine from several vintages ago. It's tart and scratchy, with thin herbal flavors of red fruit and tomato. Doesn't seem worth much these days.",Spain,Mencía
"While this may already be in its latter stages of freshness, it's still offering nice lemon and minerality on the nose. It's more flat and melony in the mouth, with apple flavors running the show. Fleshy on the finish, but tasting quite nice.",Spain,Albariño
"Compact and condensed, with aromatic subtlety that suggests maturity. The palate is still fairly juicy and tight, with core intensity and surrounding flavors of black plum, berry and spice. Complex and tasty, but probably at its peak level; drink now.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"Gold in color, then oaky and resiny, with a strong barrel element, honey and baked fruit on the nose. Full, sticky and catchy in the mouth, with resin, toast and baked apple and peach flavors. A unique style of mature, barrel-aged Viura. Not for everyone.",Spain,White Blend
"Deep aromas of mint, raisin, Christmas spice and hickory reflect ripeness and 24 months in barrel. The palate has a choppy feel due to firm acidity and tannins, while the flavors are roasted and leathery but also suggest earthy fruit. Not a sweet, modern wine; it's more meaty and savory. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Prune and lead pencil are the key aromas, and there's raisin in the background. The palate offers a mix of lushness and pulsing acid shocks, while the flavors are dark, sweet and pruney. Short on the finish and overall it's more dark and sultry than your average Graciano.",Spain,Graciano
"Loamy berry and saucy notes make for a complex bouquet, while the mouthfeel on this Catalonian blend is smooth, round, precise and structured. Flavors of ripe plum, herbs, licorice and savory spices finish dark, chunky and deep, with lasting cocoa and cherry notes that suggest warmth and richness. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Red Blend
"Nearly seven years after harvest, it remains lively and vital. Pointed aromas of lemony oak, pencil lead and cassis are classy and a touch earthy. This is balanced in feel, but with penty of gas in the tank. Roasted, warm flavors of berry, plum, spice, herbs and pepper finish firm, with cocoa and nutmeg notes that introduce secondary tobacco and earth accents. Drink through 2019.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Just like the previous vintage, this is a melony, fresh wine with apple aromas backed by a semi-creamy palate of peach and banana. It has a soft outlook but it isn't flabby, and thus a slight finishing note of powdered sugar and vanilla frosting seems right. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd. Best Buy.",Spain,Viura
"Slightly baked and raisiny, with aromas of black currants and blackberry jam. The palate pushes some zest and kick, while the raspberry and plum flavors are best initially and then break up before a simple finish. Offers a good midlevel taste of Priorato. Imported by Fine Estates From Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"An interesting white wine based on Chardonnay and Xarello. It's like Cava without the fizz, and the nose starts out dry and like Sherry before green apple and lime come into view. Tastes really dry and chalky, with mineral and apple at its core. Imported by Organic Vintners.",Spain,White Blend
"Schisty red fruit aromas come with hints of vanilla and dried cheese. The palate is crisp and snappy, but not sharp, with strawberry, raspberry, plum and licorice flavors. Shows good length and a sweet vanilla tinge on the finish. A well-made, affordable Priorat.",Spain,Red Blend
"Hailing from a 3-acre old-vines vineyard, this fully oaked Rioja blend is toasty to the max but hits with intensity, acidity and depth on the palate. Burgundian in many ways, but with more sweetness and honey than the French model. Mouthfilling and very rich, with buttery baked apple, pecan and toasty, warm flavors.",Spain,White Blend
"Smoky, rubbery and suggestive of bacon and toast on the nose. The palate is more crisp and snappy, with juicy flavors of red currant, cherry and spice. Acidity throughout yields a lemony finish, but it's also chiseled and tight, which should please traditionalists who like their acidic bite.",Spain,Mencía
"Opens with salinic, furry aromas and never does the bouquet fully fill out. The palate is sort of light and spotty, with brambly flavors along with basic black fruit notes. Seems soft on the finish, with a syrupy sweetness. Good and easy but lacking in structure and specifics.",Spain,Red Blend
"Apple and peach aromas are perfectly nice and typical for a fresh, young Albariño. There's nothing crazy or wild about this wine; it's straightforward and approachable, with green apple, pineapple and a lot of lemony sharpness. Finishes fresh and minerally.",Spain,Albariño
"Saucy and a touch baked, with savory lead aromas that render the fruit secondary. Zesty in the mouth, with juicy, prickly acids that propel red fruit, tomato, olive and herbal flavors. Finishes lively and alert, with oregano and dried raspberry flavors. Drink now through 2017.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Here's a dry, crisp, apple-and-citrus Verdejo that's stony and good from head to toe. In the mouth, it's wet, juicy and biting, while the flavors of green fruits, lemon, celery, fresh lettuce and sweet bell pepper are tangy and fresh. Quite nice for a 100,000-case, $10 quaffer.",Spain,Verdejo
"Big and dark, with deep aromas of turned earth and roasted black fruits. The palate has a soft, meaty feel along with sweet, semi-soupy flavors of rooty berry, tea, spice and herbs. Finishes with more oak than fruit, but also lush and sweet. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This full-bodied, ripe wine  offers blackberry and spiced plum aromas on top of a minerally base. In the mouth, it's big but fresh and free-flowing. Flavors of black plum and black cherry are lively despite some creamy oak that rises on the finish. Drink through 2016.",Spain,Garnacha
"This blend of Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon is a dense, ripe bruiser with huge blackberry aromas that set up a wide-bodied, raw-feeling palate with tons of extract and monster tannins. Blackberry, espresso, chocolate and spice flavors are full, ripe and deep. Things hold firm on a staunch, youthful finish. Drink through 2021.",Spain,Red Blend
"Earthy aromas of baked plum and raspberry set up a lively palate with bright, persistent acids and a full body. Baked but still vital flavors of plum, berry and spice finish with notes of cocoa, herbs and tomato. This is an elegant Priorat with lasting snap. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Red Blend
"Cool berry, graphite, cola and prune are the lead aromas on this ripe RDD. In the mouth, choppy tannins and firm acids create a strong, edgy feel. Flavors of cassis, wild berry, coconut and vanilla announce ripeness and plenty of oak. It finishes with abrupt tannins, tons of residual flavor and weight. Drink now through 2021.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Ripe dark-fruit aromas come with ample oak, spice and balsamic notes. It's lush and deep in the mouth, with a shot of lemony acidity for mooring. Blackberry, loamy berry, baking spice and toast flavors finish plump, round and with a cedary note. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This wine explores the fresher, racier side of the Priorat region. Berry fruit with just the slightest hint of raisin dominates the nose and the palate. Flavors of red plum and raspberry are borderline scouring, but then the finish gives some mocha and sage to bring everything into focus. Best with food; drink now. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Tropical and easy to like. We don't see many white Garnachas in the U.S., but this one shows mango, melon and vanilla on the nose and the palate follows up with lychee, apple and baking spice flavors. Plump and mellow but with adequate acidity; refreshing while it's young. Drink now. Imported by Grapes of Spain. Best Buy.",Spain,Grenache Blanc
"Gritty, granular and a bit raisiny at first, and then more settled later on. For Monastrell this is snappy, dry and solid, with cherry, raspberry, plum and vanilla forming a standard flavor package. The finish offers a bit of chocolate cream, but overall it's basic, tannic and full, with some bite.",Spain,Red Blend
"Lemony and light on the bouquet. The palate is aggressive, almondy tasting and tight, with lemony lead flavors, peach notes and a lasting but not unpleasant bitterness. Nicely balanced, with good mouthfeel. A very nice wine and a different breed within the wide world of Spanish white wines.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Dry and spicy, with a note of bacon to go with red berry fruit and leathery aromas. The palate is voluminous and round, with smooth tannins, balanced acids and nice flavors of roasted berry and dry plum. Finishes dry, elegant and with tea-like flavors. A wine to enjoy; good value for Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light and clean, with dust, toast, raspberry and flowery notes to the bouquet. Fresh and properly round in the mouth, with a lot of red fruit and length. Bright, lifted and likable on the finish, with good flow. Better than most rosé Cavas.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fresh, melony aromas give this Verdejo a pleasant, accurate bouquet that's easygoing and not sharp. There are grapefruit and orange flavors, and a hint of chive. Nothing complicated; just pure white fruit fun with citrusy acids and a lightly bitter finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Opens with a nice mix of black fruit scents, primarily blackberry. The palate is juicy and healthy, with berry, plum, spice and herbal flavors. Fades smoothly for a $10 Garnacha, with controlled herbal accents. An honest wine for all-occasion drinking.",Spain,Alicante Bouschet
"Citrusy and full on the nose, with a fleshy palate that sports fresh white grapefruit and passion fruit flavors. This is a textbook Verdejo from Rueda with modest sweaty notes, grapefruit galore, citrus pith and minerality. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"Blueberry, savory plum and lemony oak are the key aromas on this firmly structured RDD. Flavors of blackened toast, blackberry, pepper and creamy oak finish pure, strong and long, with mint, licorice and chocolaty residual notes. Drink through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Black in color and concentrated on the nose, this Tinta de Toro overflows with cassis and blackberry aromas. The palate is lively and lifted, with plenty of acidity and kick. Flavors of cassis and dark berries are charged up and toasty, while chocolate notes, firm tannins and a gritty edge define the finish. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Tinta de Toro

"Opens with hard, ripe, almost forced aromas, which settle with air. The palate is wiry, firm and a touch hot, with cola, raspberry and plum flavors that rattle around on a bed of racy acidity. Finishes rather lean and raw, but with honest flavors of Garnacha and Carignan, which comprise 90% of the blend. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromatically forward, with rubbery blackberry and grilled meat aromas. When it settles it shows grapey flavors and a chewy mouthfeel. Grabby, alert and snappy on the finish; this wine doesn't lack bounce or kick.",Spain,Red Blend
"Nice black cherry, cracked pepper and a slight wave of perfume make the nose attractive, while the palate is bright and a touch sharp with red-fruit flavors. Cherry, red plum and gentle spice notes work the finish, and overall the wine seems honest and well made.",Spain,Garnacha
"Lightly fragrant and fruity on the nose, with earth and leather to give it meaning. The palate is medium-weight, with fresh berry and cherry flavors along with finishing notes of pepper and tobacco. Rumbles along like a good, everyday, classic Rioja. A throwback in style. Imported by Palm Bay International.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Heavy on the nose, with a blend of earth, herbs, olive and asphalt. The palate has a solid, good feel and snappy, herbal, tomatoey flavors. Structured but kind of green, especially on the finish where bell pepper and green tobacco rise up.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Neutral and clean, with green banana and apple aromas. The palate is fleshy but maintains its vivacity along with apple, peach and pithy, bitter flavors. It's lush for a Verdejo-Viura blend, with a finish that goes on and on.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"A solid Albariño and an improvement over the previous vintage. Vanilla and apple aromas are standard and good, while the palate is plump, fresh, melony and peachy, with softness but no flab. Drink this wine right away (summer sipping) because it's not going to make it until 2012.",Spain,Albariño
"Aromas of red licorice candy and raspberry are fruity, forward and clean. The palate is more than competent and balanced, with creamy strawberry and raspberry flavors. The finish is short but easy, and for the price that's all you can ask for.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rubbery, jammy and dark on the nose, then juicy, fresh and linear in the mouth. This is a racy wine courtesy of high-acid Graciano; it's punchy and offers bright red berry, plum, dill and vanilla flavors. Finishes with some fresh tang and black cherry tea notes.",Spain,Garnacha-Graciano
"This colorfully packaged wine screams “concept export,” but what's in the bottle holds up to scrutiny. There's above-average cherry/berry aromas and then a full palate with popping acidity pushing lightly herbal plum and berry flavors. A well-made Garnacha from 20-year-old vineyards.",Spain,Garnacha
"Floral and alert, and overall the bouquet is promising. This is quintessential by-the-glass Bierzo; it's creamy, full and solid, with nice black cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. Nothing spectacular but quite good in a no-nonsense way.",Spain,Mencía
"On the nose this wine remains ripe and vital, but subdued. Tobacco, vanilla and baking-spice scents ride on top of mature berry aromas. A rubbery, healthy mouthfeel is round and showing pulse, while flavors of baked berry fruits, spice and cocoa finish dry, earthy and composed. Drink this mature Rioja now through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Gritty and tough, but amid the rough tannins and bite there is red plum, licorice candy and brown sugar sweetness. Flavors of berry fruit and raisin cover the racy and sweet ends of the spectrum, while the finish is tight to the point of being raw.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"An unusual blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Picapoll that hits with apple and melon aromas. The palate is soda-like, with zest, spritz and tangy lemon-lime and green apple flavors. Dry, pithy and a little strange in its flavor profile. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,White Blend
"Pungent and sweaty like Verdejo, and definitely not Albariño as we know it. This Castillian white starts out strong and sweaty, like hockey gear left too long in the bag. But the flavors of pink grapefruit, kiwi and lime are good, and the feel is fleshy if a bit flat. Finishes pithy and citric. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,White Blend
Not for everyone but not a bad sweet wine for desserts and cheeses. The nose is hard to describe but the palate and flavors are familiar: sweet applesauce and sugared pastry along with mango and candy. Decent acidity keeps it fresh and moving forward. Imported by Admiral Imports.,Spain,White Blend
"Earthy, leafy compost aromas are initially evident on the nose, and while the wine has some feel issue due to an abundance of raw tannins, it eventually rounds out and delivers oily, herbal flavors of blackberry and plum. Dark and muscular, but also aggressive and beefy. Seems a little untamed for a Telmo Rodriguez wine. Imported by Vintus LLC.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Mocha and vanilla stand out courtesy of three months of barrel aging. There's also solid red fruit aromas below the outward oak. The palate has lift, freshness and flow, while the flavors of plum and berry are nice and show a creamy vanilla side. 75% Monsatrell and 25% Syrah.",Spain,Monastrell-Syrah
"Fresh, crisp and oceanic in style, with green apple and lime on the nose. This is a juicy, sheer style of white wine from northern Spain that's all about freshness, high acidity, citrus and green notes. It's not complicated but it will go well with seafood and salads.",Spain,Hondarrabi Zuri
"A perennial Best Buy Rioja white that never deviates from the formula, which includes crisp aromas, fresh white fruit flavors and just enough sweetness so it doesn't come across tart. With proper acidity and weight, it hits the spot.",Spain,Viura
"This Syrah is big, rubbery and heavily charred on the nose, with iodine and minerally notes kicking in. The palate is deep but not too heavy, with juicy acidity. Flavors of plum, berry, chocolate and spice finish toasty, with licorice and espresso notes. Drink now through 2018.",Spain,Syrah
"Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are pure and lusty. In the mouth, it shows chewy tannins, a stout structure and generous flavors of blackberry, chocolate, pepper and a spot of salty brine. A toasty, dark, heady finish confirms the overall quality. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Clean as polished glass, with touches of red plum and cherry on the nose. The palate is fresh and balanced, but basic and moderate in terms of flavors. Finishes with light cherry and raspberry notes. Garnacha with 30% white Viura. Imported by Admiral Imports. Best Buy.",Spain,Rosé
"If basic Argentinean Torrontés is to your liking, so will this be. It's fresh and green on the nose, with melon and lychee aromas. Those fruits carry onto the palate, where lemon-lime and crystallized mango flavors are sweet but crisped up by snappy acidity. Serve chilled. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,White Blend
"Big and baked, with aromas of cheese and leather offsetting sweet black fruit. Flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate are as baked and sweet as the nose, and the feel is grabby and leaves a sugary residue on the finish. Wants to be a modern, ripe wine but proves to be simple and overdone. Imported by The Portfolio Group.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of barrel spice and grilled pineapple are solid, while the palate is thick and creamy with orange marmalade and banana flavors. If you like a thick, unctuous Chard with a glob of oak, this is it. Has its strong points but tastes too much like cinnamon stick and wood. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Spice and leather aromas are positive while the smells of burnt leaves and green herbs aren't too appealing. The palate is big and wide with a mix of cherry cough drop, plum and burnt coffee flavors. And the finish evaporates fast, leaving heat and medicinal notes.",Spain,Red Blend
"Minty smelling, with herbal red fruit and rhubarb scents. The wine is clack, clack, clack on the palate as acids and snappy red fruit draw everything down to the base level. Flavors of raspberry and light vanilla are clean but high-toned, and there's an undercurrent of tomato. A tough wine from a vintage to forget.",Spain,Red Blend
"A touch green and grassy at the start, with cinnamon, cherry candy and red-fruit aromas. The palate is fresh and snappy, with sweet berry flavors and just a slight bit of resin and/or green character. Finishes light and quick, making it an easygoing red wine that isn't meant for deep analysis.",Spain,Garnacha
"Hailing from the hottest vintage in years, this is round, rubbery and showing sweet, rooty aromas of root beer, cola, mocha and stewed plum. Dense but soft, it has rubbery, savory flavors of barbecue sauce, herbal plum, tomato and carob. An earthy, loamy, chunky finish offers tobacco and baking spice accents. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"On this medium-bodied, sweet Moscatel, the tangerine peel and lychee aromas require airing to get beyond the basics. Mango, melon and lychee are the lead flavors, while the finish is peachy and easy, with richness but nothing cloying. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Moscatel
"Jammy berry aromas are fiery and aggressive. In the mouth, this is sticky in feel, with huge, grabbing tannins and blocky ripeness. Chocolate and vanilla drape overripe black-fruit flavors, while the finish is heavy, chewy and tastes like fudge. Drink this forceful, oaky RDD now through 2020.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Round and good by Rueda standards, with melon and peach aromas but not too much citrus. The palate is full and chunky, with papaya, melon and a touch of pithy bitterness. More regular than special, but good and goes down easy before finishing dry.",Spain,Verdejo
"Hard to complain about a fresh, basic white wine like this. It's juicy and pleasant, with melon, citrus and nice acidity. The finish is fresh and lasting, and overall it's pure and fairly full-bodied for basic Verdejo-Viura.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"A little stalky on the nose, with basic red fruit aromas. The palate is crisp and snappy, with citrus and plum flavors and pretty nice depth. Fades out with zesty orange and raspberry, leaving some tang on the tongue.",Spain,Trepat
"Opens with pleasant, traditional aromas of dried red fruits, spice and citrus peel. The wine has a mature feel with tomato, dried currant, raspberry and light mocha flavors. Finishes earthy and a touch herbal. Nice as lighter-framed Rioja goes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lemon, buttercup and apple aromas produce a delicate nose. The palate is smooth but soft, with only a modicum of minerality. Tastes sweet and melony, with equally sweet pear and apple flavors in the background. Falls off on the finish, where the acidity is low. Drink now.",Spain,Godello
"Nice Garnacha and Tempranillo that's mature and ready to go. The nose is earthy, spicy, peppery and round, while the palate has a solid, healthy feel to it and flavors of dried berry fruit, fresh tomato and herbs. A little roasted at its core, but good overall.",Spain,Red Blend
"Slightly roasted on the nose, with aromas of blackberry and a penetrating grassy note. The palate is authentic for RDD, with clipped, herbal flavors accenting soupy berry and bouillon. Finishes earthy, meaning there are leafy notes and dryness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With its apple, peach and melon aromas, the bouquet is solid. The palate is a bit spritzy and spread thin, and that's confirmed via fleshy, dilute flavors of white peach and green melon. Plump and simple on the finish; good for salads, shrimp and grilled white meats.",Spain,Albariño
"One taste and you can see the correlation between this Priorat dry PX and certain fino-style Sherries. It's nutty and dry as a bone, with almondy aromas. Crisp acidity provides backbone and the flavors of barely sweet pear, apple and white peach are fully dry and don't push the envelope. Clean but limited in scope.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"A tiny bit earthy and peppery, with solid berry fruit aromas. The palate is sappy and medium-weight, with red-fruit flavors dominated by raspberry. Shows a touch of mocha/chocolate on a dry, basic finish. Imported by Bourgeois Family Selections.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Definitely sweet, syrupy and raisiny. Torres has made a chunky, plodding wine with saturated berry and plum flavors but hardly any of the mineral, schist, zest and excitement the Priorat is renowned for. Deep, dark and dense for sure, but ultimately flabby and mediocre. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stretched on the nose, with reedy, wiry, candied red-fruit aromas. Quite tannic and a bit syrupy in the mouth, with ultrasweet berry flavors and then a scratchy, forward finish. Has its merits but seems out of place and pushy for Spain. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A decent old-school throwback, with dried spice, pepper and slight red-fruit aromas followed by a light-bodied palate of plum and raspberry. While it's mostly lean, there is the smallest note of caramel and toffee to the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A fleshy, simple wine with gumball aromas. The palate is chubby but not all that structured, with plump but basic berry and plum flavors. The finish shows some blackberry but not much else. Good and generally clean, but rudimentary. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Starts out pretty good and fruity, but becomes more challenged with time. There's a truckload of early raspberry fruit, but it turns more sharp and piercing the more time it sits. Lengthy and potent, but not elevated.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sweet and syrupy, with molasses on the nose. On one hand it's rich, ripe and flavorful, but also cooked, lumpy and heavy. It's almost like a sweet red; sappy and made to be drunk soon.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Meaty, rubbery aromas of berry fruits come with hints of minty green and lemony oak. This feels wide and tannic on the palate, with ripe, oaky flavors of berry, cassis, vanilla and licorice. A creamy palate is healthy and completes the wine in fine fashion; drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe blackberry, graphite and tobacco aromas become oakier with airing, making resin, vanilla and mocha notes rise up. The wine is lush and weighty in the mouth, with loamy, baked flavors of black fruits, raisin, herbs and chocolate. A smooth, textured finish is home to licorice and sweet berry flavors. Drink now through 2017.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Rusty and mature looking, this is woodsy, dry and rooty on the nose, with whiffs of tree bark and tobacco running alongside cherry and berry notes. It's mature, with flavors of stewed plum, herbs and spice that are straight from the textbook, while the finish is dry, earthy and showing core acidity. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This dense, purple wine is packed with roasted, charred aromas of burnt toast, espresso and plum. The palate is creamy and smooth, with good core acidity. Flavors of loamy berry, raw oak, chocolate and herbs finish smooth, woody and lush. Only 300 cases made; drink through 2019.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dense black cherry and stewed plum aromas introduce this round, jammy and ultraripe Syrah. In the mouth, the wine is rich and chunky, with brandied cherry and baked berry and plum flavors topped with sprinkles of nutmeg and cumin. Nothing evaporates on the ripe finish. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Syrah
"Zesty, edgy red berry aromas are bright, scratchy and sweet. The palate is healthy, balanced and creamy, with juicy, slightly candied flavors of red berry fruits and herbs. Creamy and round but balanced. Shows the good side Cariñena at a fair price; 60% Garnacha and 40% Syrah.",Spain,Grenache-Syrah
"Earthy and oaky, with toasty heft, spice and a heavy sweetness to the nose. In the mouth, it's jammy and rich but also slightly soft and flabby, with baked, concentrated, sweet flavors of blackberry, caramel, coffee and prune. Spicy and sweet on the finish; drink sooner rather than later.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"Punch bowl aromas of pineapple, passion fruit and citrus are more tropical and inviting than you're average Macabeo. The palate is lush and fresh, with sweet green fruit flavors and then a wash of cutting acidity. Simple and fruity bargain white wine.",Spain,Macabeo
"The bouquet is fresh and offers clean red fruit aromas and not too much candy. The palate is lifted and healthy, with fresh red apple, plum and red licorice flavors. Solid on the finish; makes it through the vetting process with flying colors.",Spain,Rosé
"Full, brambly and spicy, with red fruit aromas and a hint of tire rubber. The palate is juicy and snappy, with forward raspberry and plum fruit. Finishes sheer and peppery, with good length and vitality. About all one can expect from $10 Tempranillo.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pineapple and citrus cover the fruity side of the bouquet while oak and resin aromas confirm that it's a barrel-fermented wine. The palate has a good mouthfeel and solid acidity, but the flavors of apple and citrus are woody and resiny. A small-production wine that requires an affinity for woodiness to fully appreciate.",Spain,Verdejo
"Talk about a wine that makes you take notice. This is simply great modern Rioja. The nose is creamy but honest, with black fruit, mocha and finely tanned leather. The palate gives the whole range of berry and tree fruits, with expansive tannins and just enough core acidity to make it stunning. Ultra stylish and delicious; another huge success for the Eguren family that owns San Vicente and other Rioja properties.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A slightly murky and chemical-smelling wine with a nose of rubber band, beets, red fruits and licorice. It's sweet and roasted in the mouth, with molasses and raisin flavors. Hard tannins and a gritty finish make it a tough run. The winery is trying to make something good and elevated, but the vintage (hot) didn't comply.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"Nobody ever said Yecla in southern Spain is Sauvignon Blanc country, but here is proof that the grape does exist there. The wine is generally clean and floral, with tart apple and citrus flavors heading straight to a pithy, driving, slightly bitter finish. Shows good verve but comes up a little empty. Imported by Marquee Artisan Wines.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"The nose is heavy and dosed with burnt rubber and leather, but the palate fares better, with cherry and raspberry flavors and a pretty clean and clear mouthfeel. A simple but sound wine with a slight resiny green character but mostly it shows decent red fruit with mild sweetness. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Garnacha
"Early match-stick aromas fade and give way to scents of white fruits and wisteria flower. The plump palate offers papaya, peach and nectarine flavors, while the finish dries out quickly, leaving a slight pithy bitterness. A little bland but still pretty good. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Spain,White Blend
"Rather oily and hard on the nose, with dried cheese, brett, mint and black fruit. The palate is rich and extremely forward, and the flavors are sweet but not that substantive or complex. Chocolate and mocha on the finish are about as much carry-through as you get.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rather baked and heavy, with chunky black fruit and chocolate on the nose. First in line on the palate is raisin and prune, while in back of that there's vanilla, dill and brown sugar. With grating tannins and excess weight, this one has balance issues while still offering some good looks at Ribera del Duero. Imported by Admiral Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This Catalonian blend is a concentrated number with a narrow, fruit-forward nose and cheesy leather on the side. The palate is full, grabby and ripe; flavors of blackberry and cassis are jammy and dark. It finishes sweet in flavor and ultraripe in feel, with a syrupy aftertaste. Another year or two in bottle will help this settle down; drink through 2020.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pulpy and also minerally on the nose, with basic white fruit aromas. Zesty, crisp and defined by slate and lime in the mouth, with apple, lime and dryness to the flavor profile. A composed little white wine for simple sipping or white sangria.",Spain,Viura
"Slightly darker than most basic Campo de Borja Tempranillos, with earthy aromas along with black fruit notes. The palate is full and rugged, with scratchiness but also fresh, forward flavors of black fruits including plum and boysenberry. A good wine with guts.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Apple, sweetness, gardenia and yeast make for a correct and pleasant bouquet. The palate is smooth and full, with crisp green apple and orange flavors leading to a citrusy, lively finish. Good and well made for a standard Cava.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A smooth, friendly style of Verdejo with green fruit aromas and flavors highlighted by apple and melon. Toss in some lime, peach, minerality, nice acidity and a smooth finish and the wine is about as good as can be for the price.",Spain,Verdejo
"Crisp and neutral in style, from nose to tail. The bouquet is firm and condensed, with nothing too floral or blowsy to latch onto. In the mouth, it's tight as a drum, with limited green apple flavors and a drip of honey. Well dressed but nothing fancy or overly flavorful.",Spain,Albariño
"Our wine of the year in 2007 (the '04 El Puntido) is back with a vengeance in the 2005 vintage. This is a deep-fruited modern specimen with that elusive mix of floral, fruit and meaty characteristics. The palate is ripe and everlasting, with berry, coffee and hickory flavors. Long and calm on the finish, with amazing texture. An excellent encore to the prior year's achievement.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With the exact same rating as the awesome 2004, this new vintage of Aurus is an unbridled winner. It's a little creamy and sweet on first blush, but time and air reveals its darker, more serious side. Flavors of blackberry, barbecued beef and fudge tell all you need to know about ripeness and richness, and among the new classics of Rioja, Aurus is one of the leaders. Drink now and over the next three years. It's not really for long-term cellaring.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Super pungent and forceful, with extreme aromas of grapefruit, nettle and sweat. Aggressive and spritzy feeling, with tangy lemon-lime flavors accented by a dose of sweeter tangerine. Citric at all points. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Sauvignon
"Peppery and lightly herbal on the nose, with a whiff of dry red fruits. The palate is pretty snappy and angular, however, the red-fruit flavors mixed with pepper and spice ring true. Finishes dry without a whole lot of carry. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Smells a little fiery, although you do get decent cherry and raspberry from the nose. Solid enough in the mouth, with ripe plum and black cherry flavors in front of a candied, vanilla-ladened finish. Pretty good, with commercially viable sweetness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A hint of burnt leaves and compost draws down the bouquet, but overall this is a decent $9 wine. It's crisp, acidic and a little stemmy, but amid the leanness it also has an appealing fresh quality that emphasizes red fruit, pepper and snap.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Given the price, this wine is more than acceptable and may even be pleasing for those not seeking greatness. It is punchy and grapey, with a bit of dried cheese on the nose along with berry and plum. It's sizable, loud, concentrated and tastes pretty good. Among $7 wines, it's recommended.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of berry fruits, coconut and leather add up well, but the wine falls off in the mouth, where it's sweet, gummy and jacked up. Very tannic and compact in terms of feel, with a hard finish anchored by serious tannins. Fruity and forward but lacking balance. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Big and heavy, with forceful aromas of shoe polish, tar and balsam wood. It's saturated and dense in the mouth, but the cherry and blackberry flavors are tart and underdeveloped. And the finish falls off fast. Imported by Baron Francois Ltd.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Char-accented wild berry and plum aromas go straight into a bright, edgy palate of cherry and plum, and overall this is a simple, slightly candied Garnacha that has some sizzle and burn to it. Racy and the slightest bit green at its core.",Spain,Garnacha
"A heavy aromatic dose of funk, bramble and rubber is what greets you, and that reduced awkwardness never leaves the wine. Size and in-your-face leather and animal notes are dominant traits, and only below that do you find blackberry, plum and any mellowness. A good mouthfeel is the wine's saving grace. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Dark and medicinal smelling, with brandied blackberry and hard cheese aromas. The palate features big fruit resting on a beam of acidity, which yields semisharp black plum and granular berry flavors. Finishes with some clamp and chop.",Spain,Mencía
"White fruits, flower blossom and a touch of brine work the nose, which is followed by flush, semisweet apple, gooseberry and lime flavors. More sweet than outright tangy, but still citrusy and zesty. Holds form on the crisp finish. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Here's a serious Cava with Champagne qualities. The nose is nutty and rich, with hints of vanilla and popcorn that aren't overdone. The palate is toasty but also candied, with citrus blending perfectly with butterscotch. Plump and ripe through the finish, this is high-end and stylish, as Spanish bubbly goes. Drink now or hold in a good cellar for a few more years.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The wine's tan-gold color tells you that it's fading, the aromas of canned pineapple are not particularly fresh, and the finish is fleshy and fat. Imported by Alconde Vineyards, LLC.",Spain,Verdejo
"Best early and then it shows its lesser pedigree later on. Early aromas of ripe berry fruit aren't bad before they shift to measurably jumpy and edgy. There's black cherry candy flavors and then snap, crackle and pop on the tongue. Good for the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Seems sort of waxy and baked, with mildly acrid aromas of burnt corn leading the way. The palate has an o.k. feel but the flavors are rather bitter and burnt, and the fruit isn't pointed or expressive. May already be past its prime. Imported by Winery Exchange.",Spain,Verdejo
"Opens with dried red fruit and cinnamon aromas, but after that the mouth is creamy and grabby, with bland fruit and then a wave of vanilla cream and milk chocolate on the finish. A sticky wine that doesn't fully pass the balance test.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Not bad on the nose, where strawberry and cream aromas are doused a bit by a burnt-field smell. In the mouth, it's snappy and elastic, with tart flavors of apple, underripe nectarine and grapefruit. Finishes lean and crisp, without much personality. Imported by Testa Wines Of The World.",Spain,Rosé
"Pleasant but very basic, with a nose of dry cherry and a palate that's crisp, lean and features flavors of tart plum and cherry. A decidedly crisp and lean style of Rioja, with no richness to speak of save for a hint of butter on the finish. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Starts out on shaky ground with coconut and chemical aromas. In the mouth, it hits very hard with cola, raisin and cherry flavors. Falls flat and empty on the finish, and as a whole it seems overdone. Seems like a novelty, and at $36 it fails to impress.",Spain,Petite Verdot
"Roll out the barrel, or the staves, or the oak dust, or whatever it is that gives this modest Chardonnay such an overpowering wood element. Amid all the toast and burnt popcorn there's honey, butter, baked white fruits and pretty good core acidity. Imported by JNJ International Inc.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Stemmy and rough out of the blocks, with aromas of rubber and strawberry. Seems grabby in the mouth due to rather rough tannins and high acidity, and overall the wine seems forced but lacking in the essentials. Quite expensive given the result. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With tobacco, licorice, herbs, bell pepper and carob, there's a bit of everything to this Navarran Cabernet. The palate is thick and chewy, but it's also sticky and very tannic. Flavors run toward vegetal and green, with clove, burnt sugar and roasted fruit. Heat and molasses work the finish of this beefy beast that lacks clarity.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"Fresh apple and lime aromas are pure as can be. This is chiseled, crisp and crystalline in the mouth, with lime, grapefruit and other citrus flavors. A long, firm, flavorful finish brings a slight hint of citrus  pith the longer it runs out.",Spain,Verdejo
"This has a charred, roasted opening along with big black-fruit aromas. Saturated and full-bodied, it offers flavors of baked berry, plum and herbs. It's long, expectedly toasty and fully oaked on the finish, with chunky, rubbery tannins. Drink through 2016.",Spain,Syrah
"Ripe, jammy, berry flavors are fruity, with a roasted overtone. This feels round, rubbery and fresh, while broad berry flavors include hints of herbs but not much in the way of minerality or nuance. An extracted, slightly tannic finish is weighty and smooth, but ordinary.",Spain,Red Blend
"A bit neutral for Verdejo, yet the wine's clean orange, tangerine and lime flavors are appealing. Flashes across the palate quickly, leaving light but lasting citrusy flavors on the finish. Solid, standard and ready to drink.",Spain,Verdejo
"Strawberry and raspberry aromas are muddled by a burnt stalky character. In the mouth, it has good weight and flavors of fresh herbs, mint and slightly burnt, sulfuric cherry and raspberry. Shows a candied raspberry finish along with notes of herbs.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Maybe it's already late in this wine's lifespan but the nose has a corny, overly mature set of aromas that fail to convey freshness. The mouth is more zesty and citrusy, with round flavors of orange, tangerine and dry melon. A basic wine without a lot of complexity or finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Crusty, sweet, medicinal aromas open the game. The palate has a creamy sweetness to it along with black cherry and plum flavors. Tastes more candied and oaky as it unfolds, but overall it's more than decent and very modern.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Racy cherry and red plum aromas are a bit fiery and jumpy, while the palate is forward and juicy, with sweet berry fruit flavors that carry a bit of vanilla from three months of oak aging. Fades fast on the finish, leaving a touch of caramel flavor.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice, simple and still showing staying power for an '09. Tastes of white stone fruits and melon, and shows body and adequate acidity. Not the most citric or angular Verdejo; it's more round and easy. Finishes clean with no funk. Uncomplicated white wine for immediate consumption.",Spain,Verdejo
"Ripe and modern, with a bold color and no shortage of oak. But with clean black fruit, integration and great structure, the wine handles all the wood thrown at it. Expect black fruit, toast and wood spice on the palate, followed by a stylish, meaty finish. Ripe and complete, and drinkable now through 2010 at least.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opaque in color, with reduced aromas of mushroom, rubber and so forth. But do not give up on this masculine bruiser; it will loosen up with air and offer plum, leather and chocolate flavors that are nothing short of excellent. And while it's a touch zesty at its core, the wine still mixes in enough coffee and richness to make it a modern-style success story.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A mixture of tomato, jammy red fruit, alcohol and grit gives this four-grape, Garnacha-led blend a tough path to hoe. In the mouth, the fruit is shrill as it settles on raspberry and cherry, while the feel and length are short. Hits the palate then it's gone in a flash.",Spain,Red Blend
"With basic pear, green melon and other sweet aromas, the nose is controlled. But the palate on this white Garnacha is dry and soda-like, with seltzer-like flavors touched up by citrus. Decent but bland. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Garnacha
"Standard berry along with warm, earthy aromas give it some size, and the palate shows medium-bodied raspberry and strawberry flavors. There's a forward, semiracy feel to it, but in the end there isn't a whole lot of finish, flavor or finesse.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Modest fruit aromas and a touch earthy and burnt smelling, with lively, somewhat tart raspberry and plum flavors. A bit of vanilla and caramel comes on late, and overall this ranks as a standard, lean-style Rioja. Imported by Admiral Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rhubarb and brambly black cherry aromas set up sweet, candied, fairly forced red-berry flavors that have a green element and a slightly cloying feel. The palate has some weight and creaminess to it, but also the sugary feel you get when eating cotton candy.",Spain,Garnacha
"Neutral smelling, with a hint of pool water to the nose. The palate delivers a strange combination of mustard and white grapefruit, and the finish is pithy to the extreme and mildly bitter. The blend is the uncommon mix of Sauvignon Blanc and Macabeo (Viura). Imported by Spanish Vines, Inc.",Spain,White Blend
"Aromas of strawberry, cassis and mocha are brought down a notch by vegetal notes, while the palate is heavier than the winery's straight-ahead Tempranillo. Flavors of plum and boysenberry are chunky and quick to fade, and green notes reappear on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Same score as the prior vintage, and pretty much the same tart wine. It's red in color, sweet and candied on the nose, and awkward in general. And then it's citric and sour in the mouth, with flavors of pink grapefruit. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Seems like the hot sun of central Spain got to this three-grape blend because it's undeniably sweet and baked. The aromas are pure raisin, while the palate is drawn down and syrupy. Too thick and sweet for its own good.",Spain,Red Blend
"Starts with pine, saline and berry candy aromas and it settles on sweet and jumpy. Juicy as can be and very lively, but also short, choppy, sweet and with a bubble gum character.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This barrel-aged Viura shows the upside of what is normally a pretty ordinary grape variety. Melon, apple, hay and minerally aromas are lively and don't seem nearly five years along. The palate is smooth, with vital acidity and creamy flavors of melon and apple. Complexity and elegance come up on a spicy, white-pepper finish. Drink now.",Spain,Viura
"Despite heavy aromas of baked berry, prune and raisin, this is solid on the palate, with a firm grip. Flavors of earthy plum, tomato, red currant and herbs finish pure, tight and persistent. The more this breathes and expands, the more character it shows. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Initially, this comes across as being baked out and tired, but give it time to spread out and it reveals mature, earthy, leafy aromas and a round palate with choppy, firm tannins. Earthy flavors of dried cherry, Christmas spices and chocolate yield to licorice on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"This Godello is light, fruity and offers nice lime and apple aromas. It's linear, minerally and has a true slate feel, then stony flavors of tangerine and ripe peach take over. A juicy, pure finish tops it off.",Spain,Godello
"As is normal for Embruix, the nose is generous and jammy, with extracted flavors of grapy black fruits and earth. The palate is smooth and jammy, with easy tannins and ripe flavors of plum and cassis. The finish is loamy, plump and soft. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Red Blend
"A little funky and damp smelling initially, with leather and herbal notes to go with standard blackberry aromas. The palate is warm, full and solid, with sweet but regular black fruit flavors in front of a cherry/berry finish. Totally generic for Rioja but still good.",Spain,Red Blend
"Leafy and smoky on the nose, with a firm, crusty topping. The palate is driving but has sheering acidity, while the palate shows blazing cherry, plum and tomato flavors. Oak lends caramel and toffee to a burning finish; a penetrating, somewhat punishing blend of five grapes led by Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"A lot of toasty oak on the nose announces this wine's barrel-fermented roots, and additional lemon and apple aromas are classy. In the mouth, however, it runs narrow, with sugary, almost late-harvest flavors of honey, mango and pineapple. A different style of Godello that's sweet and soft. Drink now.",Spain,Godello
"Smells baked and a little sweet, and also a touch raisiny. The palate is fresher and more jumpy due to lively acidity, while the flavors run toward stewed tomato and plum, with herbs on the back end. Solid, composed and spicy on the finish, with dill and tomato.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Solabal captures the essence of Rioja reserva with this fairly oaked, fruity wine. The palate is tight and demanding, with proper acid-to-tannin balance. Flavors of wild raspberry and plum are lively, while the finish shows some creaminess, tobacco and warmth. Drink now and over the next two years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A leader in user-friendly Monastrell from Jumilla is Luzón. Altos is the winery's high-expression baby, and if you like a bruiser with char, toast, coffee and other nocturnal characteristics, then look no further. Dynamite in terms of ripeness, with monster black-fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors. Not for the weak.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark, ripe and handsome. Those are the basics on this showy wine. Aromas of leather, shoe polish and char darken up the berry fruit, while flavors of blackberry and plum vie with oak-based mocha. Plenty of length and potential on the finish, but also some hard oak that needs more time to get absorbed. Best in 2009–2010.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Light in color with aromas of finely scented bath soap, strawberry, fresh cream and steel. The palate is a touch sweeter than you might expect, and that's because this is 60% Monastrell (Mourvèdre) along with Garnacha and Pinot Noir. Still, it's an elegant wine with punch bowl flavors.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Immediately this wine plays soft and raisiny. The nose has a stout molasses component, and the palate is sweet and vanilla-infused. A sticky strawberry flavor is sweetened up by coconut and vanilla on the finish. Not well balanced. Imported by Quintessential Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark fruit aromas come with a grainy, almost chemical side, while the palate feels gritty as it pushes licorice and black cherry flavors. Rubbery and without much finish. Imported by American Northwest Distributors Inc.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Thin and saline on the nose, with a chemical-chlorine smell. The palate is fairly sour and raw, with tough tannins and a killer grip. As a whole, the mid-level flavors don't taste like much, and the finish is clamp-down tight.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
Decent aromas but overly acidic and astringent. The cherry flavor is so sour that any vanilla or oak that may come on late can't save the day. Imported by Baron Francois Ltd.,Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lacquer and apple cider aromas lead to a sticky, sweet palate. There's a citric edge to it but mostly it's just sweet and tastes like orange slices and jelly beans. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Red licorice candy on the nose is the only sign of life. Otherwise it's just sour and dried-out, with flavors of citrus and plum skins. Past its prime.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Not much good to say here. Burnt, weak aromas include raspberry, while the acidic palate tastes of cherry and plum skins. Lean and tart-sour all the way.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Has some serious cleanliness issues on the nose, and while it's not entirely unpalatable, it does struggle to make many positive statements. Tastes flat, mealy and bitter, and there's even some burn to it. Imported by Scoperta Importing Co. Inc.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Black-fruit aromas are lively and encouraging. The mouthfeel is a touch clamped and narrow, but airing and aging should help things expand. Flavors of ripe plum and berry get a push from bright acidity, and on the finish this mix of Petit Verdot, Merlot, Cab Sauvignon and Graciano offers plenty of bounce and pulse. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Red Blend
"Robust black-fruit aromas of berry and cassis come with a mild animal note and leathery scents. This is jammy and a bit loud in terms of mouthfeel, while flavors of raisin, berry and chocolate finish meaty and loamy. Drink  through 2017.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This tiny production (250 cases), single-vineyard wine is boisterous on the nose, with pushy aromas of violet petal, earthy berry, cleaning solution and citrusy oak. Pronounced acidity and a raw, resiny oak texture give a hard, choppy feel, while flavors of cheese, coconut, vanilla and raspberry announce a warm-vintage wine. On the finish, excess acidity and abrasive tannins call for additional cellaring; best from 2015 onward.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Apple, vanilla and buttercup aromas are harmonious and lead to a driving, acidic palate that's a bit foamy but houses zesty flavors of tart apple and citrus. Crisp as they come, which keeps the palate alive and tingling.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Generic smelling, with simple melon and citrus aromas. The palate has the right level of tang and acidity, which uplifts apple, nectarine and gooseberry flavors. Tight on the finish, with lock-down acids. Very zesty stuff; a mix of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo.",Spain,Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc
"Blackberry, rubber, dark fruit and a lactic note define the bouquet, which leads to a sizable, full-bodied palate with tea, herb and dark fruit flavors. Seems a little muddled even upon airing, but it sports good acidity along with earthy, toasty, coffee notes on the finish.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Almost red in color, with clean, fruity aromas that are sweet and generic but maintain a semblance of freshness. The palate is good if a touch flat, with red apple and red plum flavors. Holds its posture on the finish; drink this year.",Spain,Rosé
"Pointed and fresh on the nose despite a whopping and seemingly heavy 15.5% alcohol level. Given its weight class, sweetness on the bouquet and palate are not unexpected; flavors run toward candied cherry and raspberry, and as a whole it's all about sweet, bouncy red fruit and friendliness.",Spain,Garnacha
"Peach is the lead aroma on the nose, which is also a bit heavy and slightly vegetal. Full and chunky in the mouth, with pithy, mildly bitter apple and melon flavors. Finishes soft and pithy. One of the more fuller-bodied Albariños out there.",Spain,Albariño
"Shows true Priorat depth and minerality while pouring on the new oak, char and polish. The mouth is ripe and saturated, with intense raspberry, plum and vanilla flavors. Extremely firm and structured, with a hint of bitter chocolate and burnt character. Drink now through 2014. Imported by National Distributing Co., Inc.",Spain,Red Blend
"The Montsarra brut has really jumped in price compared to previous releases, but it also strikes us as being more complex, complete and sexy than in the past. Expect dusty apple aromas with crispness, while the palate runs full and almost hefty, with real-deal apple and citrus flavors. This is Cava in very good form.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"An elegant Rioja made in a more traditional style. The nose is a little baked and raisiny, with additional aromas of caramel and leather. The palate is where this wine shines: the feel is elegant and smooth, while the cherry and raspberry flavors are subtle and a little bit tangy. Mature and sexy stuff; more classic than modern, but not 100% old-school.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Green and hard, with carob and ashtray aromas. The palate is simple and narrow, with sour red-fruit flavors that come to a slightly bitter ending. A defining combination of tartness and bubble gum dust isn't impressive.",Spain,Red Blend
"Reasonably fresh on the nose, but ultranarrow and tart in the mouth. In fact, it's borderline sour in the way it presents such linear red fruit. Tight as a drum and sheering. Can't say this is what we want from La Mancha.",Spain,Shiraz
"Herbal, green and grassy, with less than fresh fruit character. The palate has a weedy taste, while the finish is green and peppery. Edgy mouthfeel; barely acceptable red wine for the second straight vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Zarate is known for its late-release, leesy Albariños balanced by shearing acidity. El Palomar is cut from that cloth; it shows baked apple, oak and warmth on the nose, while the palate is razor sharp, with clean-cutting acidity. Flavors of vanilla and toast mix with spice and citrus, while the finish is long and woody, but not resiny or thick. Drink  through 2015.",Spain,Albariño
"Dry, yeasty aromas of citrus and fresh-baked bread are, as expected for a brut nature, clean and focused. Flavors of white fruits, green herbs and citrus finish fresh, with more than adequate fruit and balance.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"From a superb vintage, it delivers a big dose of earthy berry, cassis and spice aromas. The palate is bouncy and linear, with lifting acidity. Flavors of boysenberry are snappy and lively at first, then more loamy as the wine's acidity settles. Drink this bright, fruity wine through 2017.",Spain,Graciano
"Initially this is scratchy and spicy, with hints of sandalwood and crisp red fruits appearing later on. The palate is fresh and balanced, with rubbery tannins, zesty acids and subtle flavors of plum, berry and coffee. A dry, peppery finish is a proper wrap. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Cranberry and currant aromas come with hints of herbs and juniper. An astringent initial mouthfeel turns more complex with airing. Flavors of berry and plum are roasted and rubbery. It finishes on the grabby side, with chunky tannins. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with generic white-fruit aromas that are fresh and flowery but not specific. The palate is round, a bit spritzy in feel, and minerally, with lime and melon flavors. A basic white wine but for $10 that's the ticket.",Spain,White Blend
"The price is too elevated given that the wine is simple and already fading. Aromas of peach and melon are soft and a touch mealy, and so is the palate, which has a flat feel and flavors of papaya, melon and apple. Finishes pulpy and with the first hints of maderization.",Spain,Albariño
"Citrus aromas mix with hints of honey and apple. The palate is short but offers good freshness. Crisp and lean in terms of flavors, with notes of orange and lemon-lime. Citrusy and minerally on the finish. Verdejo with 30% Viura.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Solid on the nose, with red fruit aromas, mild earth and leather. The palate is snappy and zesty, with bright acidity pushing raspberry and plum flavors. Tastes and feels right on the finish; perfectly nice for a $9 wine. The blend is 80% Tempranillo and 20% Syrah.",Spain,Red Blend
"The price on this high-flying Rioja continues to go through the roof, and so does the oak and tannin. And while we still appreciate the wine's intensity and power, this vintage pushes so much espresso, burnt nut and rubber that it probably won't impress all comers. In the mouth, look for dark, almost bitter black-fruit flavors followed by a firm, tannic finish. Needs time in the cellar to find more integration. Hold for another year before checking on its status.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Questionable value at $70, but this is very good and rather unique white Rioja. Remelluri uses a multitude of common and unheard-of grapes, and they hit it with a lot of oak. Still, amid the oily richness there's balance, acidity and excellent layering of grass, spice, apple, banana and lemon flavors. Big at 14.5%, but it will go really well with baked fish or lobster.",Spain,White Blend
"Truly captivating wine for under $10? Yes, Luzón's Monastrell-Syrah blend is exactly that. It delivers huge plum and spice notes, with tobacco, herbs and smoked meat working their way into the game. Remains powerfully fruity and spicy in the mouth, with a long, minty, medicinal finish. Competes with thousands of wines priced higher. Overdelivers by a lot!",Spain,Red Blend
"Berry and plum aromas are clean and composed. The wine feels juicy, pure and medium to full in body. Flavors of cherry and plum are spiced up with a white pepper note, while oaky spice and dusty pepper flavors create a lasting, long finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stony lime and apple aromas are a proper set up to a balanced, racy palate. Flavors of dried apple, tropical fruits and pithy bitterness finish with white pepper notes and purity. This isn't complex but it will get the job done with Asian foods, salads and as an apéritif.",Spain,Muscat
"Rubber, smoke and a bit of char combine to give this Garnacha-Graciano blend a hard exterior. The palate is reasonably round, with roasted berry flavors. Finishes a little stewy and slightly tomatoey and herbal, but overall it's a good wine with true Navarran character.",Spain,Garnacha-Graciano
"Yellow in color, with a peachy, baked set of aromas. The palate hits with a blast of acidity but not much else, while the flavors are brash and lean toward green apple and green plum. Rounder and softer on the finish, but also short.",Spain,White Blend
"Perfectly good for a 70,000-case product. It's bright on the nose, with fruity aromas of orange and tangerine. The palate is properly acidic, with lemon and more mild citrus flavors. Solid on the finish; makes the grade for $10.",Spain,Verdejo
"Spunky raspberry aromas give this Tempranillo-led blend a fresh bouquet. The palate is snappy, a little high in acidity, and plenty zippy, with plum and cherry flavors. Finishes with length and some scour. Nice for everyday drinking; best with basic foods.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"A Lambrusco-like petillant that's neutral and dry as a bone on the nose except for a pinch of green. The palate has a fine, controlled spritz and lemon-lime flavors. Crisp, citrusy and refreshing, and fairly well executed.",Spain,White Blend
"Unusual aromatics for Ribera include minty blueberry and something suggesting metal and chemical. The palate is better despite smack-down tannins and briary raspberry flavors. Has some short circuits as it tries to present an elevated, $30 impression of a distinct wine region.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Made in the Moscato d'Asti style, with lemon-lime aromas and bubbles akin to Sprite. The palate features high citric acids and foaminess along with tangy lemon-lime and green apple flavors. Good on the finish due to the acidity and good overall for a Spanish version of sparkling Moscato.",Spain,Moscato
"A little heavy and reedy smelling, with plum and eggy, yeasty aromas. The palate has a good but regular feel and nectarine and raspberry flavors. It's a touch foamy and overactive on the tongue, with a finish of cherry cola and pepper dust.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fresh and healthy for Toro Malvasia, with soft apple and sweet lime flavors. The feel and approach are good, and the wine is acidic but not too much, which helps preserve the mouthfeel. Finishes nice and standard.",Spain,Malvasia
"Quite light to look at and seemingly like chewing gum upon first sniff. But give it time and inspection and you'll get melon, lime and crystal-clear acids and body. There's no fat to this Cava nor any heavy toast or cream. It's lean and wiry, and the fruit is front and center.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Melon and buttercup aromas are clean, inviting and exactly what you should expect from Albariño. The palate is also a success, with apple, pineapple and citrus flavors. A complete, fresh-style wine with the right mix of acidity and body. Drink now and until the next vintage arrives.",Spain,Albariño
"Deep in color for an '01, with sweet aromas of vanilla, tobacco, leather and hickory. The palate is endowed with big berry fruit and flavors directed by wood spice, and the tannic level is just right given the wine's midterm age. With licorice, resin and additional hickory on the finish, 7 Viñas (vineyards) is one of Baron de Ley's better efforts.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with chocolate chip and mint aromas along with solid berry fruit. The palate is pure and firm, offering clean cherry and plum flavors backed by light new oak and chocolate. More like a comfortable pair of jeans than a fine suit, but there are plenty of occasions where that's what you want. Imported by America Uncorked.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A touch minty and herbal, but also there's chocolate and creamy richness to the nose. This is a big wine that's hugely flavorful. It rumbles from bold berry to smoky dryness, and along the way there are stops at chocolate, coffee and black pepper. Always one of Jumilla's better wines, assuming you like the extracted, modern style.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mango, citrus and candied white-fruit aromas set up a weighty yet vital palate with melon, apple, citrus and gooseberry flavors. On the finish, mellow flavors of stone fruits and mild acidity create a pure, solid ending. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"White fruits, fennel and Serrano ham aromas create a sophisticated bouquet. This jabs away on the palate courtesy of citric acidity, while flavors of nectarine and citrus are good. It finishes dry and foamy.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dusty, yeasty citrus aromas are elegant, smoky and dry. In the mouth, it is well developed and a touch short, but with crispness and focus. Flavors of peach and mild citrus are slightly briny.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of graphite, asphalt, floral berry, black cherry and oak are harmonious and inviting. This wine feels juicy and rubbery, while black-fruit and plum flavors come with herbal notes and overt barrel notes. A fresh, juicy, zesty finish is pure Graciano.",Spain,Graciano
"A little charred and oaky at first, but also meaty, leathery and true to Rioja and Tempranillo. The palate is flush and full, with expansive tannins and acidity propping up olive and herb-tinged blackberry flavors. Medium deep and long on the finish. A positive, semimodern Rioja that can handle some aging.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"An Albariño with some body and complexity, Nora's single-vineyard, barrel-aged wine is definitely an oaky one. It has lots of wood dust, vanilla and lemon curd on the nose. The flavor profile is led by apples and cinnamon (from the oak), and it flows well. Not a sticky, overoaked load; instead it has balance and quasi-Burgundian feel.",Spain,Albariño
"Nice on the nose, with mildly herbal red-fruit, leather, tobacco and tomato-leaf aromas. The palate is full in size, with both creaminess and clamping tannins. The palate delivers earthy raspberry and plum flavors, while vanilla and pepper share the finish. Very nice and still capable of withstanding more cellar time. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"An opening salvo of honey and white fruits is solid as can be. The palate rolls out dry, angular citrus, pineapple and apple flavors in front of a finish that's naturally fresh and nutty. A bubbly with no muss, fuss or confusion. Best if you like ‘em dry.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Light yellow in color and slightly woody on the nose. This blend isn't overly oaked but it is plump, rich and textured. The palate features melon, lychee and spice flavors, while the back end is full and dry, with an ending blast of green melon. Drink now.",Spain,White Blend
"Serious and huge, but talk about a ton of oak: this has a ton and a half, yielding sawdust-based aromas along with creamy plum notes. The thing is, once you realize that you're all-in with the wood, it tastes good, feels good and finishes good. A 3M wine: mint, molasses and medicine. But in this style it's done well.",Spain,Garnacha
"Clean, inviting and lively, with pure berry character spread across the nose and palate. For flavors, we're talking plum, berry and chocolate, while the finish is creamy and toasty, with good balance. Not an over-the-top wine or a full-out thriller, but very good from a region known for pricey red blends.",Spain,Red Blend
"The first couple of passes are not that encouraging: there's strawberry Kool-Aid and sharp field-like aromas of thistle and bramble. But the palate is not bad at all; it is flush yet racy, with solid raspberry and plum flavors that carry onto the finish. Not a refined wine but a natural one.",Spain,Garnacha
"A bit cheesy and funky, with rhubarb and leather along with baked berry aromas. The palate feels fine, but the flavors are leathery and sort of salty, with touches of pepper and herbs as well. Not as ripe and appealing as what we're looking for from a Rioja reserva.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Solid but unspectacular on the nose, with plum scents and generic sweetness. The palate is also sweet, but it has enough acidity and tannin to create a serious, almost scratchy mouthfeel. And if you hadn't had enough sweetness up to this point, the finish is loaded with brown sugar, cola and cough medicine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"By no means a special wine but it does deliver full-force if generic dark-fruit aromas and flavors. The nose is a little hard and rubbery, but that's Utiel-Requena for you. Medium-bodied but not harsh or burnt; prune and blackberry flavors linger. Tempranillo and Syrah. Wines Imported by USA Wines Inc.",Spain,Red Blend
"Bramble and burning brush on the nose, while the palate is murky as it delivers tomato leaf, baked plum and carob flavors. Seems sort of cooked and funky, with a muddled mouthfeel. The 2005 is a cleaner, more focused wine.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dill, cheese and mossy fruit give this wine a less than super bouquet. The palate is light, with strawberry flavors mixed with some peppery, herbal overtones. Short on the finish; not much bang for the buck.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cloudy in appearance but fairly clear on the nose and palate. Rhubarb and cherry aromas give this an austere, red-fruit bouquet, and the palate rests on racy cherry and doesn't budge. Lean late in the game, with coffee and bitterness to the thin, mildly grating finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lean, dry raspberry aromas and a slight floral essence carry the nose toward a zesty, semisharp palate with crisp cherry and cranberry flavors. Not bad in a lean, stripped-back way; but there's no excess oak, weight or sweetness. Lean stuff for old-school palates nursing plates of ham or salami.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The under-$10 high scorer is fast disappearing, so take a good look at this young, jammy Tempranillo-Shiraz blend that hits nicely with ripe boysenberry and black plum. The Shiraz seems to have darkened the wine, and the mouthfeel is ripe and lush.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Cabernet Sauvignon and Monastrell made in a ripe, high-alcohol style results in monster aromas of shoe polish and black licorice. The palate is a wave of chocolate and candied black fruits that crashes into a heavy, ultraripe finish of prune and pepper. A lunker wine with a sweet smile and a big handshake.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"This wine's nose bears an uncanny similarity to animal crackers, and along the way there's peach and melon aromas. The palate is sweet and slightly punchy, with mango and white raisin flavors. Overall, bank on sweetness and liquidy ripeness from this drink-now Albariño.",Spain,Albariño
"Spicy wood notes and black fruit vie for center stage on the ripe, semimature bouquet. This is more of a traditional Ribera wine, meaning it has textured tannins, notes of tobacco and dill, and leathery, earthy berry fruit flavors. Not at all rough and ready to drink now, but still it should hold into 2009.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean and focused up front, with appealing cola, cherry and plum aromas. If you like wild berry flavors and juicy, borderline aggressive acidity, then Deyo fits your request. It's a fairly rough, spunky wine with finishing notes of espresso and bitter chocolate. Should match well with salty, robust foods.",Spain,Merlot
"Mature and a little waxy on the nose; this is a plump, fruity, semisoft wine with apple, pineapple and melon flavors. It's round and fairly mild, with plenty of taste, width and drinkability. Drink soon before it softens even further.",Spain,Albariño
"Ripe grapefruit aromas take care of the nose, while the palate shows smooth-edged citrus and grapefruit flavors. For a warm-vintage wine, this one is holding in pretty well; it has a plump body but enough liveliness to do what it should with food. Drink now; it's not getting any better.",Spain,Verdejo
"Lime, tarragon and fresh green aromas are a bit minerally and stony in front of a linear, pure palate. Flavors of lemon-lime, peach and nectarine are just right, moderately minerally and fade away with clarity and style. Drink right away.",Spain,Verdejo
"Black cherry and wild berry aromas are appealing and lusty. In the mouth, this blend of Sryah, Graciano, Tempranillo and Petit Verdot is solid but a bit thin in the middle. Flavors of raw oak, coffee and cherry finish with a wave of creamy oak. Despite its modest structure, this is a very good and interesting blend to drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Brandied cherry and cassis aromas are candied and gritty, but get better with airing. The wine is full in body and endowed with just enough acidity. Flavors of baked berry are earthy at the core, with accents of chocolate and herbs. A mellow, not overpowering finish is dry and slightly complex. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Given that this leesy Albariño is pushing eight years in age, it's remarkably healthy. Stony, briny aromas override residual fruit aromas, while the palate remains zesty. Flavors of white grapefruit and nectarine finish citric and solid.  This is a unique style of wine that no other winery in Rías Baixas is making.",Spain,Albariño
"Ripe and fully oaked, with char, mineral, cola and black-fruit aromas. In the high-flying world that is premium Priorato, this wine is serious and tough. It displays berry, plum and herbal flavors and then a thick, broad, tannic finish. Shows a tiny bit of green at its heart. 750 cases produced.",Spain,Red Blend
"The warm 2003 vintage provided this Merlot-Tempranillo blend with additional ripeness and color. And while there's still the traditional tobacco, dried cherry and herb/spice aromas the region is known for, there's also good raspberry, red plum and vanilla flavors. A well-made wine that's ready to drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Cristalino is always a solid go-to Cava. This brut is round, slightly yeasty and shows citrus aromas that veer toward lemon-lime. The palate is healthy and clean, with a narrow set of citrus and apple flavors. Fairly full and long on the finish, which makes the whole package more than worthwhile given the cost.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A dry and austere style is what you're looking at with Heredad. The nose offers simple citrus and soda aromas, while the palate is sheer and defined by apple, light spice and cleansing acidity. Not much depth below the surface but definitely clean and flashy.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dibon is new to us, and after tasting this complete, well-made Cava we are happy to make its acquaintance. The nose offers regal yeast and richness, while the palate has complexity to prop up apple, citrus and grapefruit flavors. Solid from front to back, with health and freshness.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Jammy, rich and a little sweet and reduced on the nose, but once this baby unwinds there's no stopping it. The palate is exceedingly fresh and exuberant, with strawberry and raspberry flavors. Lively to the end; a fruit-lover's wine with no leash. Drink sooner than later to capture the wine's pointed red-fruit essence.",Spain,Garnacha
"Very nice red wine but for $112 we want to be forced to take notice, and frankly that doesn't really happen here. Still, the wine goes snap, crackle and pop on both the bouquet and palate. It's a crisp one, with live-wire cherry, cola and spice flavors. Not at all flabby, and instead runs lean and fresh. Good now and maybe better in a few more years.",Spain,Red Blend
"Light but generic aromas of white fruits and white flowers give this wine a happy bouquet. The palate is starting to tip toward fading, but if you get at it soon you'll find perfectly nice peach, melon and citrus flavors setting up a soft, easygoing finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Just a bit mulchy on the nose, which signals that is a wine from the hot 2003 vintage. The palate sits on raisin and mocha, and there's even a creamy, thick feel to it. If you like rich, Porty flavors that border on dessert, it's likable. But be prepared for it to hit with a thud.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Inky dark, with deep berry, sandalwood and sawmill aromas. Color and potency are not lacking in this modern-styled Tempranillo, which hits like a hammer. Feelwise, this is a tough, angular wine that will benefit from another year or two of aging. Now it's very tight and tannic, with piercing acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Castilla y León can be good bargain country, and all of the 2006 Volteo wines are Best Buy qualifiers. This varietal Tempranillo has a clean, fruity nose backed by bright berry flavors built on a floor or two of structure. It's a composed quaffer with pure flavors, adequate length and overall balance.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The only sweetness on offer is on the nose. After that, things go lightweight and tangy, leaving a racy feel and semiastringent cherry flavors. A real sizzler with zesty red fruit and not much else.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Simple, candied cava is what this is. The nose deals red licorice and cherry, while the palate is bubbly and plump, with plum and raspberry flavors. Not much detail but plenty of size and carbonation.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Meaty and very oaky, with resin, mocha and milky aromas that amount to a wood cutter's dream. Not surprisingly, the mouthfeel is more shocking and acidic than the oaky bouquet suggests; flavors are racy and tart, and then a bitter lactic quality comes on strong. Too much going on, with nothing pulling in the same direction.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Blocky and brambly on the nose, with a fair amount of funk. The palate is crisp, semitart and lean-bodied, and with tight acidity it's a little scouring. Lots of red-fruit character but not a lot of mouthfeel.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pickle and sweet funk on the nose give this chunky wine a nose that's less than fresh. Flavors of orange, peach and cantaloupe are sweet but flat, and in the end it tastes more like a fruit juice than a really solid dry rosé.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite an unusual specimen in that you don't often see Monastrell mixed with Cabernet and Shiraz. The end result is fairly strange and unfamiliar; the nose smells saucy and lean, while the palate is also saucy and a touch medicinal.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rusty in color but natural, which is also this wine's downfall. It has no dosage, so what's left is leafy, herbal Pinot Noir aromas and flavors. It's peachy, drying and zesty, but also saddled with tomato leaf and rhubarb. Such is the life of Brut Nature rosé.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"The name boasts of balance but we find mostly pine needle, skunk and eventually creamy red-fruit aromas followed by lean, tangy stawberry and cherry flavors. Light fruit and simple oak is all that's here.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of cured meat, earthy plum and dry berry fruits are composed and harmonious. This mature wine feels firm and a touch grating, while ripe flavors of blackberry and plum are borderline baked. On the finish, a chocolaty flavor and modest depth are solid but don't amplify the wine. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rubbery, rooty aromas of herbs and berries blend with stalky red-fruit notes. This feels shrill and tangy, with hard tannins, while flavors of roasted berry fruits come with a leafy undercurrent. Roasted, herbal, oaky flavors settle in on a juicy, high-acid finish. Drink through 2020.",Spain,Red Blend
"A lively number with kick and effervescence. The nose is kind, with light fruits and a whiff of chocolate. Plum and raspberry flavors are nice and accented by earthy spice, while the wine's texture and structure seem more than solid, given its everyday price.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fairly stylish and quite serious. There's darkness to the nose along with masculine, meaty, leathery aromas. And while the bouquet is sturdy and begs you to dig in, the palate is a little less generous as it shows some herbal sharpness at its core. Overall there's commendable cherry and plum flavors, but the wine lacks some depth.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Alberdi from La Rioja Alta is a slight throwback. The nose has more than a twinge of tomato leaf, wet clay, tobacco and raisin, but also maturity and floral notes akin to a good Burgundy. Meanwhile, the palate pitches tomato leaf, cranberry, tobacco and dried plum flavors. A little bit light and reedy by modern standards, but alluring as well. Drink now. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A little wheaty and creamy, but also pleasantly warm, yeasty and toasty. The palate settles quickly on waxy apple and lemon, while the feel is sort of baked and a touch soft. Cider and sweet-spice notes help the finish along. Drink soon.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Almost volatile, but with reduced raisin below. If you are familiar with   hot-climate California Zinfandel, this is not unlike that. It has a vinegary attack and then a strange but limited sweetness lurking in the weeds. A   challenged wine.",Spain,Red Blend
"Very dark and seemingly on the cooked side of the ledger. The nose is black and raisiny, while the core flavors are saucy. At least this meaty, overdone Garnacha isn't oaked, so in that sense it isn't offensive. But it is definitely soft, and without much future.",Spain,Garnacha
"Airén is a big-crop white grape that is usually distilled into brandy or made into Sherry. But here we see it as a dry white table wine, and while it is limited in scope, the wine's punch-bowl approach and cleansing lime and kiwi flavors are decent.",Spain,Airen
"Apple and powdery citrus aromas are austere but intriguing. But in the mouth, this thing foams like bubble bath. No matter whether you like the wine's citric flavors and apple essence or not, the fact that it bubbles up like a shaken soda is not an attribute. Oriel's gran reserva is similar in terms of carbonation issues.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Brambly and tart, with a peppery, leathery nose. It's zesty, lightly concentrated Garnacha with zingy, mouth-burning raspberry and plum flavors. A sharp, reticent wine in every way. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",Spain,Garnacha
"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An herbal and brambly roughneck with forced aromas, lots of leather, and ultimately cranberry and other tart red-fruit flavors. Not much body, and thus it's short and piquant.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice and familiar, and very much in the sweet, creamy style. There's almond candy and caramel on the palate and then maple syrup on the finish. Soft and sweet throughout, with just enough acidity and complexity to save it from being boring.",Spain,Sherry
"This is Cáceres' bread-and-butter red Rioja, and the '04 is fruity, light and very approachable. The nose shows some cotton candy and other bouncy red-fruit aromas, while the palate is easygoing, fleshy and balanced by a beam of juicy acidity. Along the way, you'll pull out flavors of cherry, raspberry and a finishing note of bitter coffee.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Superripe, such that it's medicinal and pruny. The nose reeks of reduced blueberry and cassis, while the palate is soft, low in acidity and full of ripe, dark raisin, prune and spice cake flavors. If you like a dense wine, this is it. But expect it to be Port-like and on the liqueur-ish side. Drink now.",Spain,Petit Verdot
"A maturing wine with aromas of burnt leaves, dill, leather and shaded black fruit. It opens up on the palate, revealing cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with ancillary vanilla. With medium tannins and moderate acidity, the wine shows no ill effects of the broiling 2003 vintage. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate. It's a holdover from 2005, so drink it while you have it.",Spain,Albariño
"Clean and stylish, with hints of ginger ale and citrus on the nose. Good in terms of texture and flavors, with citrus and juicy nectarine working the palate. Focused and fairly long on the finish, with depth and integrity. Sweet in the extra dry style, but not candied or artificially sugared.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Crisp as it should be, with fit aromas of apple, fresh lettuce and honey. The palate is crystal clear in its delivery of lemon, apple and green banana, while the finish is vivacious and runs the distance. Quite satisfying and fairly serious given its under-$15 provenance.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Seems like the best wine under the Mercedes Eguren label. This Shiraz-Tempranillo blend is wholesome, ripe and rich. It starts with earth, leather and dark, herbal fruit aromas, which are backed by lip-smacking blackberry and mocha flavors. Shows agility and balance, but also brawn and guts. Drink now into 2010.",Spain,Shiraz-Tempranillo
"With aromatic touches of haystack and vanilla in addition to green apple and mineral, the nose is inviting. On the palate, it's nice and lemony, with green apple acids offering a modest scour. Cleansing and ideal with simple finger foods. Very nice for the price.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Lemon-lime, dry talc and mineral make for a clean, no-issues bouquet. This is a fruity, steely wine with pineapple, orange, green apple and lime flavors. The feel is like a kiss of the razor, while the finish is fresh and persistent.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Crisp, neutral and just a little lemony on the nose, with a small hint of sulfuric burn. The palate is genuine and firm, with nectarine and citrus flavors holding court. Clean and lightweight on the finish, with overall elegance. Shows good flow and balance while keeping things modest.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A little bit round given that it's a blanc de blancs, with applesauce and spice on the nose. The palate deals a white-fruit mélange that's one part tangy and one part generous. Holds steady on the finish and doesn't show any warts or faults. Nice Cava with an elevated persona.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is about as aromatically complex as Bierzo gets. It shows radical minerality, bright berry fruit, purity and passion. The palate is a fast and exciting ride highlighted by excellent acidity, kick and ripe but restrained flavors. Corullon gets better and better with each passing vintage.",Spain,Mencía
"An obscure Catalonian wine made from indigenous grapes, this pricey oddball starts with bubblegum and candy aromas mixed with smoke and meat. The color is dark and the wine is a bit rough. But in a country, unusual way it redeems itself with zippy cherry flavors and a fresh, tight mouthfeel. Best with food.",Spain,Red Blend
"Earth, leather and tomato are accents to the dry, lean bouquet. The wine is expectedly juicy and tight, with snappy raspberry and cherry flavors. It shows clean lines and an unbreakable personality; elegant, juicy and firm. Drink now–2009.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty and still fairly fresh, but with that said this wine was certainly more in its prime six or eight months ago. Now it is slick but softening, with peach and citrus flavors doing their thing without much edge or kick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ribera is not prime rosé country, and this wine doesn't much help the cause. Cherry cough drop aromas are about all you're going to get, while the palate is jumpy and sour, with apple skin and grapefruit flavors. Too much like a sucking candy.",Spain,Rosé
"Rooty on the nose, with green herb, tea and raspberry aromas. Patience and airing only brings it to the acceptable level, which means the wine's reasonably good prune and dark-fruit flavors are scuttled by a disjointed, overly acidic mouthfeel.",Spain,Red Blend
"There's something not right about the way this winery is fermenting its Cavas because both this and Oriol Rossell's regular brut are excessively foamy. As a result, this gran reserva's apple and spice aromas and flavors are rendered moot by the gaseous explosion that occurs when liquid hits palate.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is mucky and sweet. Its best foot is not put forward via the compost-like nose, and from then on there's little more than prune, leather and a sticky mouthfeel.",Spain,Garnacha
"Eight grapes comprise this weird, peanutty, almost dirty red blend. The nose is like a salad of bitter greens and peanut vinaigrette, and the palate shows big fruit, bigger tannins and then a finish of asparagus and green beans. Imported by USA Wines Inc.",Spain,Red Blend
"Another winner from Emilio Moro. The nose is a touch minty and very spicy, but the black fruit element is there and overall the bouquet sings of integration. Pure, enthralling and big, with monster black fruit flavors, complexity, rich oak and a long, smooth finish. Stylish yet powerful; drink from 2013 through 2020.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"With minerally, clean aromas of lemon-lime and seashell, this is ready for summer sipping. A tangy, citric palate offers pure orange, tangerine and lime flavors, with mango thrown in for moderate sweetness. A citrusy, cleansing palate is exactly as it should be.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Tarry upfront aromas of berry fruits, pencil lead and shoe polish announce plenty of oak. The mouthfeel on this young Toro is full and grabby, while flavors of blackberry, oak and related mint finish peppery and blackened, with residual minty oak.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"The nose on this no-dosage rosé is neutral except for a touch of brine and nuttiness. The palate is fresh, sharp and a touch rough. Flavors of dried red fruits are matched by briny notes and popcorn, while the finish tastes toasty and briny.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Off the bat, this smells of minerals, vitamins and iodine, but with airing plum and blackberry aromas arise. The wine has snappy acidity but soft edges and mild tannins. Flavors of cola, baking spices and black fruits finish wide and easy, with a dusting of pepper. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Wet and zesty white wine from Northwest Spain? Sounds good to us. Salneval is from Condes de Albarei, and it offers perfectly proper peach, melon and pastry aromas. The palate is lithe and fresh, with orange and apple. Yes, it's straightforward and common. But it is also clean, balanced and will drink well with all sorts of finger foods, salads and seafood.",Spain,Albariño
"A little rubbery and spunky at first, but patience reveals foresty berry fruit, mint and spice. The palate is vibrant as can be, with red-fruit flavors coming in front of a peppery backdrop. Everything from cough drop to kir to espresso shows up in this toasty, testy and tasty organic Monastrell.",Spain,Monastrell
"Warm, crusty and attractive up front, with a ripe blend of plum, raspberry and pepper flavors. Seems plush and focused for such an inexpensive wine, yet it's also a little bit juicy and wild. Made in the fresh style that Borsao excels at. Drink now.",Spain,Garnacha
"Standard as good brut Cavas go, with yeast, citrus and a hint of matchstick on the nose. The palate shows a good fabric comprised of lemon-lime and apple flavors. Good up front but a little weak on the back end and finish. Still, as a whole this is perfectly good, affordable bubbly that does what it's supposed to do.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Tea, floral and black cherry aromas give this aging wine some character. The palate has held onto its darkness, thus plum, blackberry and coffee flavors are in charge. The palate is flat more than lively, but overall it's a good, toasty wine with some earthy complexity. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Red Blend
"Roll out the barrels! This is one heavily charred, very toasty number. At first the oak seems forced, and always is it front and center. But with some time in the cellar, today's dark, resiny bitterness should subside. At least we hope it does, because the wine has structure, density and pretty good fruit. Definitely for folks not opposed to barrel influence.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Quite rich and yeasty, with bold aromatics of baked bread and toasted corn. That rich, individual style carries onto the palate, which is sort of chunky and soft, with cidery flavors that finish thick and a touch sweet. A much heavier style of Cava made for near-term drinking.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Clean and modest on the nose, with plump but standard apple and spice flavors. There isn't much unique or stirring about this wine, but it's flush and solid on the palate and fairly long on the finish. Perfectly good, with more yeast and size than most basic bruts. In addition, it's a little more pricey than the competition.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The bouquet provides plenty of kick as well as a hint of acacia. The palate is dry and full of green apple and nuts. Remains dry and seltzer-like on the finish, where light citrus fills any voids. Not overly flavorful or complex, but a solid white Rioja for near-term drinking.",Spain,Viura
"Twenty months in oak has created coconut aromas to go with the ripe, sappy boysenberry scents that are draped on this studly, full-force RDD. The palate is a powder keg of massive blackberry, boysenberry and chocolate flavors, and the finish is like a retaining wall that keeps everything focused on the impressive midpalate. Great if you like 'em big. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A lean and peppery style of Rioja that's very much from the old school. Red fruits such as raspberry and pie cherries steal the palate, giving the wine a tangy sensation and a spicy, almost sharp feel and finish. Very young and fresh right now; it improves with patient airing.",Spain,Tempranillo
This Macabeo (Viura) blend is neutral on the nose but fairly big and bulky on the palate. Flavors of lemon-lime and banana are spritzy at first and then stickier late. The rest of the composition (Macabeo and Parellada) dictates that the flavors will be short; but what's on display is nice and creamy.,Spain,White Blend
"A powerful berry-based wine with no oak is what's on offer. The nose exudes rubber and leather at first, and then comes a wave of rambunctious black fruit. The palate is bright and packed, with ripe plum and cherry flavors. Shows good mouthfeel and chewy tannins. And once again: no oak!",Spain,Tempranillo
"Persistently murky and leafy on the nose, this traditional-style Rioja brings juicier, brighter fruit to the palate along with some tangy, somewhat sharp acids. In the folds, a dash of oak brings vanilla and additional tannin into the picture. Improves with airing.",Spain,Tempranillo
"It's not easy to find mature Rioja from a great winery and a great year. This is all that; it smells of tobacco, earth and dried fruits. The palate is lively and not dying, while the flavors of cherry, raisin and marzipan are spot on. Compact and long on the finish, indicating that it still has another 10–15 years in it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big and sultry as always, with bacon, smoke, black fruit and a full rack of spices making for a wonderful bouquet. Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. And then comes tobacco and more spice on the finish, which is grabby but understandable because it's so young. Best from 2012 through 2019.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Once again this is a stalwart modern-style Rioja with a mix of floral aromas, licorice, blackberry and coconut. The palate is both lively and subtle, and the flavor profile shows an impressive blend of cherry, plum, cream and cocoa, while the finish is long and smooth. A high-quality wine that should impress. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Wiry, scratchy raspberry aromas are a touch herbal but stop short of veering toward green. This blend is full, rubbery and a touch sticky in feel. Flavors of blackberry, oak and mint finish with heavy tannins and a resiny, grabby feel.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"This dry, floral, exotic Rioja is a different breed of cat. The bouquet is jammy and herbal, with flowery notes. In the mouth, abrasive tannins hold up a wayward frame, while blueberry, plum and floral flavors finish with prune and dried herb notes. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's a nice shine to this slightly sweet but solid rosé out of Navarra. The bouquet is fresh for the most part, while the palate offers lively raspberry, citrus and melon flavors. A touch of residual sugar is sweetening things up, but overall it's very drinkable. Open right away or wait for the 2008 to arrive next summer.",Spain,Garnacha
"If the choice is between sleek packaging and good product, take the product every time. And with Garnacha de Fuego, the product is sound to the point of surprising. A bouquet of huge berry aromas is the opening act, followed by flavors of red apple, kirsch and plum. Offers lots of fruit in front of a short, simple finish. And then it's time to open another bottle.",Spain,Garnacha
"Muga always makes a solid, clear-style rosé, and this one fits that mold. It's light in color, with peach, melon and mineral on the clean, steely bouquet. Narrow on the palate, with peach and citrus flavors. Shows a sly touch and will work with food.",Spain,Rosé
"Not overly fruity up front; instead there's a strong hint of lettuce, greens and peach pit on the bouquet. The palate is more round and giving, with a tropical blend of pineapple, citrus and apple flavors. Finishes dry and firm, making it perfectly good in the $12-and-under category.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Subtle aromas of white fruits, talc and powdered sugar are totally what they should be given that this is an extra dry Cava. The palate is a little sudsy and active, but the flavors of citrus and white pepper are balanced and not overly sweet or confected. Shows good clarity from start to finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Solid as can be, with sweet-styled aromas of berry syrup and tire rubber. In the mouth, the wine shows juicy cherry and raspberry flavors in front of a lively finish. Throughout it shows good form and a bit more roughness than the Volteo varietal Tempranillo or the line's Tempranillo-Shiraz blend.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"It's hard to rate an aging, oxidizing, barrel-fermented Verdejo and take into consideration the wine's faded qualities versus its complexities. If you like dried apricots, dehydrated mango slices and fruit jellies, then this will tickle your fancy. Adherents to the school that believes whites should be fresh and palate cleansing should take a pass.",Spain,Verdejo
"This tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors. Roundness and a smooth feel work in the wine's favor, because there's just enough acidity to push the length on the finish. Drink right away.",Spain,Sauvignon
"Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character. The palate is nothing special; there's citrus and pineapple before a medium-long finish. Solid but not the most expressive Albariño out there.",Spain,Albariño
"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.",Spain,Verdejo
"This blend of six vineyards is great. It's dense and full of minerality, finely polished leather and pure berry aromas. The palate sings a melodious tune that begins with creamy oaky notes and expands to more defined plum, vanilla and fine herb flavors. The '04 Bembibre is a rounder, more complete version than the impressive but more austere 2002 (the last Bembibre we reviewed). It is immediately pleasing and keeps you on the hook to the end.",Spain,Mencía
"A pure and intense rendition of Priorato. The nose is stacked with minerality, smoke, ink and tough but regal black fruit aromas. It's powerful and concentrated in the mouth, with bold cassis and blackberry flavors in front of a long, flavorful, slightly lemony finish. Needs a few years to show its best; drink from 2011 through 2017.",Spain,Red Blend
"A big-time Priorato with tobacco, minerality and dark fruit aromas in front of a lush and smooth palate full of cola, blackberry and licorice flavors. There's all the power you could ask for but also complexity and layering that set up a minerally finish of mocha and coffee. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Spain,Red Blend
"Jammy but generic berry fruit aromas are crowded by lactic, pasty oak scents and vanilla. The wine is hard as cement in the mouth, with jagged tannins. Flavors of sun-baked raisin and plum fold in chocolate and rubbery notes on a grabby finish that includes residual resiny oak. This could use more time; try after 2016.",Spain,Red Blend
"Light, yeasty aromas are not overly fruity but they are clean and approachable. It's fruity and plump on the palate, with nectarine, apricot and mild citrus flavors. A smooth, moderately creamy finish is comfortable and easygoing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Horsey, leathery aromas are earthy and funky, although with time blackberry notes rise up. The wine is lively, tough and offers bracing acidity. Flavors of herbs, licorice and lemony acidity support core blackberry fruit, while the finish is herbal and woodsy, with dark notes of espresso and black licorice.",Spain,Tempranillo
Minerally black plum and boysenberry aromas set up a rubbery palate with medium weight and intensity. Generic but happy flavors of blackberry and cassis finish with dry spice and rubbery notes  as well as length and freshness.,Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Aromas of rubber, leafy red fruit and herbal raspberry are solid. It's crisp in the mouth, with raspy tannins supporting tight cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes like it flows, with firm acidity and zest more than richness, leaving a hint of creamy vanilla and heat as it fades away.",Spain,Red Blend
"Muga has crafted a steely, no-fat Viura (with 10% Malvasia), despite the wine being fermented in barrel. The nose is clean and passive, while the palate is crisp and tight but largely neutral in its delivery of apple and lemon flavors. From a cool vintage, this wine is like kissing the razor's edge. Good stuff but limited in what it has in store.",Spain,Viura
"The unheralded Tarragona D.O. delivers a basic winner in this varietal Tempranillo. It comes out of the gate well, with deep cherry, kirsch and coffee aromas. The palate falls off a touch from the promise of the bouquet, but overall the wine is generous and fruity and sincere. More balanced and complex than one might expect from a Catalonian value-priced red.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Citrusy on the nose, with just a hint of sulfuric burn and smoke. Flavors of sweet white grapefruit, tangerine and tarragon leaf give the palate that little bit extra, while the finish is smooth but short. Good but a touch flat on the back end and finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Both Freixenet and its sister property Segura Viudas put out myriad Cavas in this price and quality range. This one shows cherry candy on the nose and some seltzer. The palate is balanced between sweet red fruit and citrus, while the finish is dry despite some earlier sweetness. Bouncy and nice for a Pinot Noir Cava.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Nothing outrageous but this Garnacha, which now has a little age on it, is more than satisfying. The nose delivers cherry, plum and even a little cookie, while the savory palate features molasses, plum and spice. Subtle, composed and sort of old-school. Drink now.",Spain,Garnacha
"A little baked and flat smelling, with licorice and stewed fruit aromas. Sounds kind of dark and heavy, right? But the palate runs to the thin side, with lean but pure raspberry and cherry flavors. Vitality and snap are its virtues; not much depth or character are its fallbacks.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Magenta-tinted and ready to go; that in a nutshell is this easy, no-oak blend of Tempranillo and Grenache. It's fruity to the max, with aromas of boysenberry and black cherry as well as similar flavors. Ripe and easy to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty and neutral on the nose, with a hint of wild flower and mineral to stir interest. The palate is dry despite having some size and plumpness; flavors of apple, peach and papaya are crisp and lean.",Spain,Muscat
"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.",Spain,White Blend
"Oily and pungent, as if the cat were not let out of the house. But airing reveals a wide spectrum of green, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables. There's passion fruit, green pastures and some citrus in this varietally typical Rueda SB.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Very dark for Mencía, which indicates that it is an old-vines wine of pedigree. The nose is composed of cigar box, licorice gumdrop, balsam wood and berry fruit. In a word it's hedonistic, and the richness and full-bodied berry and plum flavors may just bowl you over. It's definitely more oaky than many, but it still qualifies as Bierzo at its most bountiful.",Spain,Mencía
"Rock-solid Tempranillo that wows with its richness and depth, but also shows a touch of ripeness-based sweetness that critics could see as candied and simple. But that's splitting hairs, and we prefer to compliment the wine's dynamite intensity and its rangy finish. Maybe a touch bigger and less complex than Fournier's AlfaSpiga, but still excellent. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A swaggering, slightly traditional holdover from the amazing 2001 vintage. This wine delivers cumin, pepper, turned earth and vanilla-infused berry aromas in front of a juicy, forward, complex palate featuring prime red-berry flavors along with hints of red pepper flake and tobacco. It still shows ample oak and vanilla but the fruit quality, tannins and structure can handle it. Drink now–2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Really nice and lush, with an aromatic mix of tobacco, baked fruit, mocha, vanilla, shoe polish, earth and more. It displays a ripe, friendly feel and yummy flavors of mocha, chocolate and savory, subtle berry fruits. Layered on the finish, with lasting notes of fig, mocha and blackberry. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Heavy char and cedar aromas sit atop green-leaning black-fruit scents. This is tight, juicy, acidic and woody on the palate, with shallow black-fruit flavors that are largely covered by charred oak. A zesty, toasted and tangy finish is full of life but falls short on complexity and depth.",Spain,Graciano
"Rubber, cured meat and herbal berry aromas feed into a tomatoey palate with raw acidity and rough tannins. This features gritty flavors of berry and raisin, while the finish is a bit flat in feel and tastes of prune and stalky, roasted berries. Unlike many Ribera wines, this is earthy and not overly ripe. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rubbery, meaty and fully ripe smelling: that's the nose on this round and dark Monastrell. Yet while it hints at being bold and burly, the palate is more restrained and subtle. Don't expect a ton of stuffing, and instead look for savory plum and olive flavors in front of a short, stout finish. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Monastrell
"There's nothing not to like about this affordable Spanish bubbly. The nose is a little candied and shy, but it's pleasant overall. The palate foams a bit more than a stately Cava might, but the flavors of pear, apple and grapefruit are honest. Fresh yet soft, simple and easygoing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Good but basic wine from southern Spain that shows cherry aromas with a citrusy twist. The mix is Monastrell with Syrah and Tempranillo, and as a whole it is composed, with berry, plum and other straightforward flavors. A plump, friendly sort of wine that isn't too complicated.",Spain,Red Blend
"Campo de Borja's “everyman's” red rides again in 2007. Sure, it's sweet and candied, but that's the 75% Garnacha talking. Flavors of berry, plum and chocolate are bold and forward, though not very complex. Seems more lush and heavy than in the past. Good for those who don't want to think much about what they're drinking.",Spain,Red Blend
"Slightly more chunky and dusty than lively, with dry apple aromas and not much else. The palate offers a medium level of intensity and flavors of melon, banana and white pepper. Turns drier and more soda-like on the finish. Good but a little short on flavor.",Spain,Albariño
"A little cloudy and minty, with aromas of herbs and reeds bumping up against cherry cough drop. That medicinal cherry flavor joins plum and light pepper, while the feel is lively, bracing and forward. Gets better with airing, and overall it tastes a little more natural than some Jumilla heavyweights.",Spain,Monastrell
"Stylistically speaking, this oak-aged wine is very different from all of Borsao's fruit-first Garnachas. And that isn't exactly a full-out compliment. So while the wine has balance and structure, the oak seems dominant on the nose and palate, which lends more vanilla and cream than spice and character.",Spain,Red Blend
"Quintessential value wine from Spain is what you're getting with Viña Borgia's 100% Garnacha. The nose is candied for sure, but it settles to show the upside of Grenache rather than the weaker, more remedial side. Flavors of bright cherry and raspberry are high-toned and pure, and the finish offers a little pepper and edge.",Spain,Garnacha
"Interesting and unique blends get bonus points, but in the long run this conglomeration of indigenous grapes from Mallorca is a touch too resiny and bland to really deserve a call out. But for soft melon and pithy flavors, and the fact that it's made from the obscure Prensal and Muscat, we like it well enough.",Spain,White Blend
"A warm vintage (2006) may be causing this wine to expire prematurely, but tasted in 2008 it seems to be losing its drive. The nose has wild flower and melon aromas, while the palate shows simple apricot, pineapple and mango flavors. The tropical notes are here, but the texture is watery and as a whole it doesn't go the extra yard.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Approach this simple Tempranillo with modest expectations and the jammy cherry aromas and flavors will strike you as pure and fresh. Complexity and style are not part of the equation, but an unoaked raspberry character, length and correct balance make it worthy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar. Still, it manages to push tasty apple cider, papaya and other fuller-bodied, less acidic flavors.",Spain,Verdejo
"With each vintage this bruising Toro gets more comfortable and familiar. Yes, it's still a tannic behemoth with a ton of new oak, but under all that bluster there's wonderful Tinta de Toro blackberry, licorice and tobacco flavors. And the finish of mocha and more is better than any visit to Starbucks. Hold until 2009.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This small-production, ultraexpressive Bierzo features dynamite structure and intensity, a clear reflection of old vines grown at altitude. The nose exudes minerality and dense black fruit along with a good whack of fine French oak. The palate runs for miles while distributing warmth, richness, chocolate, minerality and length. Already drinking well but will age nicely for another three to five years.",Spain,Mencía
"It seems that all of Monsieur Magrez's new wines from around the world have a similar DNA: size, ripeness, plenty of new oak and ultimately quality. This big-boned Toro shows tons of ripe black cherry flavors darkened by bitter chocolate and espresso. It's immensely oaky now and should benefit from a couple to 10 years on its side. Imported by Bernard Magrez.",Spain,Tempranillo
"From what will go down as a legendary vintage, the '01 Lanciano is a full-boned but elegant wine with deftly balanced aromas of chocolate, mint, graphite and berry compote. The feel is satisfying and chewy, while the flavors of cherry cola, black plum and cocoa are pure and lasting. Good now through 2012. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection, Ltd.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Some early gas and sulfuric aromas blow off from the nose, leaving meaty berry scents. This wine sports a natural personality; it mixes leather and herb notes with polished but not overdone berry and plum flavors. And the finish is rich with molasses and leather. Probably best from 2008 through 2012. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"This shows classic dill, vanilla and brambly fruit aromas. Meanwhile, the palate deals wave after wave of vanilla-infused red fruit. For classicists this will constitute a trip down memory lane; a testament to the greatness of 2001.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is truly a unique wine in the sense that hardly any Verdejos are fermented in oak. Not only that, the end result is stellar. There's soft buttercup aromas leading into a layered, vanilla-edged palate of spiced apple, melon and greens. The wine is round, substantive and it stirs interest. And for that we're grateful. Drink now through 2008.",Spain,Verdejo
"Staunch red fruit aromas are a bit prickly at first, but within a few minutes they settle on mineral, herbs, anise and licorice. The palate has a firm but pure feel, and the tannins aren't too tough at all. Flavors of cassis, cherry cough drop and raisin are deep yet narrow, and just complex enough. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"Another great Tempranillo from Sierra Cantabria? Indeed it is. The nose bleeds cedary, sweet black fruit aromas and coconut, while the palate is pure and layered, with a lush feel and rich flavors of black fruits and chocolate. Long and lasting on the finish, and delicious overall. Approachable now but ageable for at least five years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Thoroughly modern in style, with an oaky nose of campfire, spice, vanilla, sawdust and molten berry. The palate is solid and shows good vital acidity, while the flavors of blackberry are meaty and thorough, with hints of coconut, chocolate and cream. Seems a little more balanced and interesting than FB's richer, softer Selección.",Spain,Red Blend
"Concentrated and sweet, with a baked, raisiny richness that maintains its clarity. The palate is dense but not punishing or tannic. Flavors of blackberry and prune veer toward syrupy, setting up a sweet, generous finish of fig paste and coconut. Modern-styled Rioja done right.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A complete modern Rioja with cola, cassis and smoky aromas. Excellent mouthfeel and toasty black fruit and licorice flavors work well together, and the finish is refined, warm and peppery. Not an overly lush wine but it is generous and loaded with a bit of everything good: body, tannin, acidity, flavor and complexity. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of burnt orange peel, apricot, cinnamon and clove are accented by wild herb and nettle scents. This is full, resiny and borderline cloying in feel, while flavors of blow-torched caramel, peach, dried mango and oak finish honeyed and spicy, but also bitter. Drink this amber, mature wine now.",Spain,Moscatel
"Plum, cranberry and blueberry aromas come with earth and ample oak. The wine is jammy and a touch lazy on the palate. Flavors of savory, baked plum and spicy, stewed berry fruits finish with leftover oak and spice flavors as well as a jammy feel.",Spain,Grenache-Carignan
"Ginger ale and a touch of powdered sugar give this extra dry Cava its proper sweet aromas. The flavors are solid, if you like candied orange slices and lemon-lime soda. Shows good mouthfeel and more than adequate freshness. Perfectly competent given that it's $9.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The bouquet delivers some of that creamy, corn-like smell that many Cavas show. There is also cereal and citrus to the nose. Flavors of nectarine, grapefruit and green herbs are fresh and in the lead, and the feel is soft-edged. Shows some green bitterness on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Probably not a Cava for wine snobs. But who says all wines have to be super serious and complex? This one shows cured meat, tarragon, sweet tea and Muscat aromas, while the flavors are pure lychee and honeydew. Frothy and sugary, but that's the spumante style. Best with birthday cake, etc.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"From the Freixenet group of wineries, Vionta is clean but more neutral than we'd like to see. You won't be offended by the wine's green apple and lemon flavors, which are wet, fresh and zesty. But you might like a touch more refinement and dimension. A good wine, but a basic one.",Spain,Albariño
"Gets off early with fresh tomato, spiced red plum, tobacco and vanilla aromas. The palate is fine but tight, with herbal fruit flavors, pepper, tomato and sharp acidity. Finishes with olive and tomato notes. Not the sweetest or softest thing going, but good if you like Navarran wines and their patented herbal, red-fruit character.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This wine is a “product” in every sense of the word. It's consistent from year to year, and if you know Esmeralda, with its sweet blend of Moscatel and Gewürz, then you know that it delivers simple but pleasant lime, kiwi and cantaloupe flavors with a certain watery freshness.",Spain,Moscatel
"While we'd suggest waiting for the 2007 to hit the market, this softer-styled wine is showing mature melon, tropical fruit and bee's wax aromas in front of mild citrus, lemon and pineapple flavors. It has a medium-weight body and almost a honeyed roundness. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best.",Spain,White Blend
"Matchstick, mushroom and licorice nib aromas add character to this fading but textured wine that struggles to offer peach and nectarine flavors. Expect additional softness with each passing month, and along the way you should only hope to salvage some citrus, white chocolate and melon notes.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dry black cherry and berry fruit shows some early chemical accents, and the wine stays sort of thin and hard all the way to the end. It's peppery and tight, with a simple dark-fruit personality. A little awkward at 14.5%.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The traditional side of Rioja is exhibited in the wine's vanilla, dill and peppery aromas, but the palate shows lots of red fruit, butter and a core of perfect acidity and tannins. This is a consistent wine that doesn't overwhelm. If you're looking for Nuevo Classico heft, color and power, look elsewhere. Best from 2008 through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Clearly Bodegas Roda threw all its best fruit at its '02 Roda I: it's as smooth, succulent and ripe as we've come to expect from this front-line alta expression Tempranillo. There's oak, vanilla, tannin, resin and lots of studly red and black fruit to give you something to ponder. Good now and better in a couple of years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"From 80-year-old vines planted on steep slopes, this shows an early blast of buttery oak, but underneath there's mineral, coffee, lemon peel and potent fruit. Power and tightness define the palate, which is also intensely mineral as it teeters on the border of overoaked and leathery.",Spain,Mencía
"CVNE must have done a strict selection in chilly, wet 2002 to get a reserva that's this sound. The nose is a lovely, traditional blend of earth, leather, coffee, spicy wood and red fruits. The palate follows suit, showing raspberry, strawberry, plum and vanilla flavors. A great, understated wine from what was a forgettable year for most Rioja producers.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"An excellent Verdejo from Rueda is as good as fresh, crisp white wine from Spain gets. And the two Victorias that make José Pariente know their stuff. After an overly ripe 2005, this vintage shows more of Pariente's patented lemon, citrus and mango flavors. The feel of the wine is super solid and the finish is long and properly acidic. It's a treat for fans of Spanish whites.",Spain,Verdejo
"This is Descendientes' so-called starter Bierzo, but it rises above the tried and true value zone to exhibit mineral, crushed violet petals, graham cracker and pure dark-fruit aromas. The palate is smooth and plush, with lush black-fruit flavors, easygoing tannins and some creamy length. It's not as vivid as the 2005, but it's still mighty impressive.",Spain,Mencía
"Somontano is not exactly prime real estate among Spanish wine regions, but Blecua, a four-grape blend led by Cabernet Sauvignon, is one of the best wines the region has to offer. Smoke, licorice, rooty cola and lemony oak aromas mix with flavors of blackberry, coffee, cola and roasted meats. It's a bit choppy and hard now, but time will help it along. A classy wine to drink from 2011 through 2016.",Spain,Red Blend
"A rewarding wine that isn't overly pricey or difficult to enjoy. Dark, lightly baked aromas hint at raisin and marshmallow, while the palate has a deep texture and vital acidity. Savory, tea-infused flavors bring pulse and kick, and as a whole it delivers a true reflection of what Ribera del Duero should be.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Earth, rubber, spice, oak and bold berry aromas give this a classic Ribera nose, while the palate is pure and sensual, with shining raspberry, strawberry and plum flavors. Control and poise are on display, and the finish is clean, dry, warm and satisfying. Will be better in two or three years; best from 2012 through 2018.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Gold in color, with mineral, toast, baked apple and stone-fruit aromas, this Albariño is plump and mature on the palate. Flavors of peach, papaya and minerals finish long and peachy, with baked apple and minerally notes to the finish. This is showing its age; drink immediately or  wait for the 2012.",Spain,Albariño
"Dusty, yeasty aromas of red apple skins, cherry and chocolate lead to a solid and true palate with a good bubble bead, moderate elegance and full flavors of plum, red apple, cherry and spice. This is full-bodied Cava with a smooth, robust finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Boysenberry and blueberry aromas are accented by violet notes and cedary oak. The wine is snappy and slightly reduced in feel, while flavors of rooty berry, herbs, spice and tree bark finish dry, with hints of tobacco and barbecue smoke. Drink now.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dust, lime, lychee, thyme and oregano aromas create a complex bouquet. It is round in texture but also juicy due to core acidity. Flavors of lychee, melon and spiced apple rest on a full body. Finishing notes of herbs and tropical fruits are fresh and appealing.",Spain,Moscatel
"This mature Albariño is mellow on the nose, then wide and melony in feel. It's leesy but also healthy in terms of acidity, with flavors of papaya, melon and peach. It's flavorful for sure, but a touch bland on the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Cava from Rioja may not compute but it's definitely an approved category of sparkling wine. This is minerally and smells a lot like vitamins. The palate is round, moderately foamy and wide. Flavors of passion fruit, papaya and nectarine finish smooth, with an easy bubble bead.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The nose delivers a light but perceptible blast of sucking candy, children's vitamin and perfume aromas. The palate shows additional candied characteristics, but for the most part it's fresh and easy, with a good feel. Generic as a whole, but competent and satisfying.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The smell of honey and lemon-lime soda give this a basic but respectable opening. It's sort of foamy and plump in the mouth, with apple and green-herb flavors. Lacks a little touch but offers bouncy fruit and no overt faults. Imported by Winelink Imports.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The neon pink color is a dead giveaway that Garnacha is the basis of this rosé. Smells spunky and quite fresh on the nose, with a touch of bubble-gum sweetness. Flavors of raspberry and cotton candy catch the tart and sweet sides of things, so overall it's offering a little of everything. Drink now.",Spain,Rosé
"A little aggressive out of the chute, with a nose that's sort of raspy. The fruit on the palate is tangy and tastes like early picked nectarines with a lemon twist. Crisp and short, but very clean and focused.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Salmon-colored and dense, with aromas of clay, cherry and brown sugar. Pinot Noir-ish in its smoky, dried-berry palate and peppery finish. Robust, solid and with texture.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Age is beginning to show up on this gran reserva. It's a little raisiny and Sherried on the nose, while the palate is wiry but not exactly thin, with dry raspberry, pie cherry and plum skin flavors. Baked bean, caramel, vanilla and tobacco all play big roles on the finish, which is scouring and tight. Drink now; it's probably not going to improve with further age.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of cherry-chocolate and rubber are firm and a little closed. And such a bouquet doesn't really portend a flavor profile dominated by pink grapefruit and tight citrus. But that's really where this Cava rests: in the mouth, it's single-mindedly about pink grapefruit, which is fine if that's a flavor you like.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Savory and deep given the price, with dark color, obvious ripeness and even a touch of vanilla and mocha on the nose. Round in the mouth and immensely fruity, with plum and berry flavors blending with vanilla. Textured and medium-long on the finish. Good for everyday quaffing, especially in the cold fall and winter months.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit too much new American oak was thrown at this crianza, leaving minty, drying aromas that veer into the butter and dill range. The palate is largely fresh and balanced, with peppery red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry. A woody encore smothers the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cloudy in color, with tart rhubarb aromas. The palate shows some acidity and tang, with pink grapefruit flavors offering a shrill kick. But overall the wine has seen better days and has become limited in scope at this point.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fiery, hot aromas feature raspberry, burnt leaves, balsamic notes and earth. It's wild and jumpy in the mouth, with rhubarb and cranberry defining the tight, underdeveloped palate, while the finish is tangy and almost peachy. Shows many cool-year characteristics of a 2002.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fresh peach and nectarine dominate the nose on this semisweet blend of Viura and Malvasia. The flavors are mostly melon and citrus, while the finishing touch is that of fruit cocktail. It's a touch sticky in the long run, but at least it isn't cloying or cooked.",Spain,White Blend
"Aromatic notes of talcum powder and scented candles give this Bordeaux blend from Navarra a light, pleasant bouquet. But the palate is more starching and hard than ideal, leaving a spiky, jagged feel to the wine's raspberry and plum fruit. So rugged and jarring that food is downright mandatory. Ripped but punishing.",Spain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Rueda is best when it's fresh and dancing, but this 2006 is showing too many signs of the hot year from which it came. It's already tired and soft, with compost and mealy citrus aromas going head to head with grapefruit and marmalade notes. Tasted in December 2007, this was probably a tastier, fresher wine six months prior.",Spain,Verdejo
"For an old-school highlight, look for this lesser known selection-based Reserva, because good grapes from a good year should add up to good wine. And in this case, the wine is better than good; it's ripe, spicy, chocolaty and pushes all the right buttons. A sure thing with the right foods: meats, stews, etc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is what Albariño is all about! The nose issues a salinic combo of salt water and sea shells along with green banana and melon, while the palate is jumpy, fresh, balanced and intriguing. The flavors of just-ripe bananas and Meyer lemon are true, while the mouthfeel is both smooth and refreshing. Get after this one as soon as you can.",Spain,Albariño
"This wine reflects the great vintage and CVNE's long-standing status as a quality Rioja winery; the final product zips along with lively blackberry and plum flavors before slowing into a smooth, mellow and lengthy finish. A blue chip wine with style and finesse.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smoky, alluring and sexy; this is a fine holdover from the excellent 2001 vintage. The bouquet is subtle and dusty, while the palate builds in power as the blackberry and plum flavors jump back and forth between lush and dynamic. An excellent Rioja reserva from the Rioja property of Julian Chivite.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Coffee grounds, some minty wood and lots of ripe fruit greet you, and the lower levels contain all the sweet, dark fruit and oak-based chocolate and vanilla one could ever ask for. This is new-age wine to the max, and some might call it overdone. But if you like ripeness and a rowdy mix of body, tannins and acidity, this is it.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This is not a blow-you-away RDD, but it is a smooth, well-composed red wine with clean, alluring aromas and ripe-styled fruit flavors that touch on raisin but then pull back to black cherry and dark plum. With its integrated tannins and mild finish, this is ready to go now and should hold form for about five years, maybe eight.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With red wines joven usually means a few months in oak. It seems as though this wine was made the same way; there's a kiss of popcorn and buttered toast to the lemon and melon nose, while the palate has life, texture and complexity. Flavorwise, you should enjoy the wine's papaya, green banana and other tempered tropical flavors. Balanced and pleasing, and proof that certain Spanish whites can take some oaking.",Spain,Godello
"Dark and crusty aromas of black fruit, wild black truffles, coconut and lemon peel are pure Priorato, while the tight, tannic palate provokes salivation as it delivers firm black cherry, dark plum and citrusy (lemon) flavors. Finishes with coffee and coconut. The definition of a harmonious Priorat red. Drink from 2011 through 2016.",Spain,Red Blend
"Impressive for the way it blends modern richness with authentic aromas and flavors. The nose offers prune, leather, blackberry and fine dried cheese, while the palate is savory and smooth, with chocolaty, round berry fruit flavors and then additional chocolate and toast on the finish. Lively and dense, but not heavy. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Peach, melon, citrus and yeasty notes define the nose on this dry brut nature. This offers good texture, fluffy carbonation and citrusy acidity in front of papaya, dry mango, nectarine and peach flavors. The finish is fruity in flavor and citrusy in feel.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of raspberry and plum compote are candied and not complex. The wine is snappy, alert and raw in feel, with plum, raspberry and green herb notes. An herbal, lightly oaky finish feels zesty and juicy.",Spain,Graciano
"Rubber band, almond skin and dry citrus aromas feed into a tight, raw, rubbery feeling palate with a low fruit quotient and more brine and bitterness than expected. This is quite dry, salty and pithy but also fresh and lively on the finish. Drink immediately.",Spain,White Blend
"Stony citrus aromas blend with green notes and lees-based vanilla. This is lean and citrusy on the tongue, with nectarine, citrus and green-herb flavors. A zesty finish is a bit shallow, but overall this fresh wine is easy to like.",Spain,Verdejo
"A touch scratchy and rough on the nose, with pepper and leathery fruit aromas. The palate keeps that edge while offering peppery berry flavors and oak. More tannic and woody than one might hope for, with lactic notes on the finish. Shows flashes but comes up average. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Garnacha
"Silly name but pretty good wine. A tidal wave of cherry/berry aromas is authentic, natural, youthful and floral. The palate is just as bright and bouncy, with red fruit running away with things. A touch of mineral and chocolate at the end gives it some darkness to match the vibrancy.",Spain,Monastrell
"Even though it's a sweet-styled Cava, the nose kicks up lemon and apple aromas that are familiar as can be. The palate, however, is quite sweet and supports the Semi Dry labeling. Candied but not sticky, with a slightly chalky finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Ultra purple and sort of gummy and confected. But it's also pretty solid in the mouth, with tannin instead of flatness holding things together. Tastes like sweet dark plums and candy, while a hint of black coffee darkness enters on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The Borsao brand is a bargain pioneer, and while the wines aren't $4.99 anymore they are still squarely “value” oriented. This rosé is fairly steely and fresh, with pithy grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Lean and peppery on the finish, and ready to be consumed right away.",Spain,Rosé
"Already in the twilight of its lifespan, this is a friendly rosé with a little wiggle and kick. The palate sits on ripe nectarine and pink grapefruit, while the finish offers pepper and spice. A little pithy but pretty good if you get at it soon.",Spain,Rosé
"Take the bubbles out of Cava and this is pretty much what's left. The nose is light, with peach and banana aromas. Tangy flavors of orange and pineapple are lively but lacking, and the finish is ripe but simple. For flush flavors and just enough zap, this is good.",Spain,White Blend
"Oily and citrusy, with pungent, almost nutty aromas that are at once exotic but simultaneously funky and sour. The palate hits with chopping passion fruit and citrus, but there's also some banana to contemplate. In the end, it's just too hard to embrace and go beyond a sip or two, which isn't a great testimonial.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Sweet and chunky, like Hawaiian Punch. This is heavy and unctuous at this stage of evolution, with raspberry and ripe melon flavors. Round and no longer edgy. Wait for the 2007.",Spain,Grenache
"An oaky, awkward, lactic lug that offers a ton of wood grain, funky fruit and a hard, overly spicy mouthfeel. It's trying to do too much with smoke and mirrors; the raw material isn't there.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This wine is at its peak and you may wish to wait for the 2006, but if you encounter this toasty, mineral-influenced Godello, go for it. The palate is loaded with peach, papaya and green melon, while the finish is creamy and smooth. With Gaba do Xil, the stateliness and simple pleasures of Valdeorras on are on full display. From Vinos de Telmo Rodriguez.",Spain,Godello
"Red fruit is the dominant player on both the raspberry-driven bouquet and the currant- and cherry-laced palate. In the mouth there's integrity, natural acidity and restrained oak as opposed to heft and unnecessary burnt coffee and chocolate notes. Very clean and well made wine with aging potential. Good upon release and will hold through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Deep and dark on the nose, with licorice, cola and prune aromas. The palate is chunky and full, albeit a touch soft. Saturated flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate define it as a rich, modern wine, and the finish is appropriately creamy and stacked with sweetness and depth. A lush blend of Garnacha, Cabernet and two indigenous varieties. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Red Blend
"Opens with earth, tobacco, briar and nutty aromas. This is now aged to its best state, and while there's still some tannic bite, it's at a straightforward, mature place. Flavors of roasted plum and spice are classy, and the finish is reflective of a fine vintage. Drink now or in the near future.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark and dense, with aromas of rich black fruits, grilled meat and a lot of oak. The palate is extracted but it's not the least bit hard or biting. Flavors of Concord grapes and blackberry are sweet, and the finish keeps its fruit. Could it use more minerality and toughness? Maybe, but as is it's very approachable. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stalky aromas suggest animal hide and roasted fruit. The wine is rubbery, firm and leathery in feel, with plum, berry, raisin and other dark-fruit flavors. On the finish, it feels earthy and tastes like stewed black fruits and prune. Drink sooner rather than later.",Spain,Red Blend
"Initially this wine is flat and a bit chemical on the nose, but with time lime and tropical fruit aromas poke through. The mouthfeel is round but a little bland and broken up, while flavors of yeasty, bready tropical fruits and applesauce finish easy but flabby.",Spain,Moscatel
"A bit of forward oak comes across on the nose, while mocha and pretty good berry fruit keep things focused. Like most Navarran wines, this is snappy and “red” in character, with herbal tomato and plum flavors. Classic finishing notes of olive and dill close things out.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A typically reserved Navarran wine is what this is. The nose offers dry red fruit, spice and not much else. The palate is mildly citric and herbal, but there's enough cherry and leather to carry things to a medium-length   finish of dill, vanilla and spice. A nice and simple food wine.",Spain,Red Blend
"A little creamy, waxy and scattershot, but also far more exotic and different than most $8 wines. This is barrel-fermented Viura, but the oak level is light and manageable. Flavors of papaya, melon and citrus are almost tropical in scope, and the finish is pretty fresh. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",Spain,Viura
"Quite brambly and funky, with a roasted “country” quality that points it toward leather and rubber. An organic wine with 80% Tempranillo and 20% Garnacha; it's sort of tangy and choppy on the palate, with a mix of awkwardly sweet and sour flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Concentrated aromas of mocha, toffee and burnt coffee bound from the glass, followed by flavors of sour red cherry and berry. Sound balance and soft, dusty tannins make this wine easily enjoyable and easy to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"So young and simple that one can only describe this as Albariño Nouveau. It's a bouncy, almost spritzy confection with pineapple, green apple and other thin citrus flavors. There's zero body to it, but it is fresh and snappy.",Spain,Albariño
"Deep and clear in color, and very solid smelling; the prune and mineral aromas form the base, with woodsy notes offering complexity. The palate is chiseled and juicy, with plum, berry, tobacco and espresso flavors. Best to drink now. Only 600 cases made; 125 imported.",Spain,Mencía
"A big surprise! This shows that it rates many levels higher than what $9 usually buys. The nose is smooth, clean and fresh, with a hint of lemon peel to accent raspberry. The palate is exuberant and balanced, with three-star feel. For unoaked Garnacha that's sure to please, this is where you should turn.",Spain,Garnacha
"Plump and ripe in style, with a lot of charm to its personality. This is very nice and simple Tempranillo (with 15% Garnacha and Graciano), and it's ready to drink now. The feel is on the flush side, and there's jamminess to the palate along with light pickle notes and vanilla on the finish. Coming along nicely; this review reflects an improvement over a tasting done in May 2007.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The label says it: fermented in barrel. And one sniff delivers the buttery, toasted character of a Burgundy or California Chardonnay. Underneath the oak, there's fine acidity and blazing apple fruit, and once it finishes you get a finely baked aftertaste. An interesting, elevated mix of Treixadura, Godello, Loureira and Albariño.",Spain,White Blend
"The opening of peach, mineral, honey and wild green herbs is alluring, and the palate runs smooth and full, and also a little soft and mature. Banana, papaya and melon flavors are pretty and the finish holds its stature. Not as minerally and tight as some; this wine has sweetness and depth. Drink soon.",Spain,Godello
"A treasure at this price. The nose is impeccably clean, with tropical fruit and honeyed melon aromas. Elegant in the mouth yet there's also just the right acidic pop to liven up the melon, kiwi and apple flavors. A pure, fruity ride. Treixadura, Torrontées, Loureira and Albariño comprise the blend.",Spain,White Blend
"Dusty red-fruit aromas set up an easy, likable palate with a mix of citrus and briny apple flavors. There's good tang and acidity along with length to the finish. That briny character from the flavor profile comes back on the finish.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Cedary oak, vanilla, tobacco and lemony notes blend with floral plum and berry on the nose of this Tempranillo-Cabernet blend. The mouthfeel is wiry and reduced in feel, while flavors of baking spices, wood grain, stewed berry and raisin finish minty, with licorice and anise accents. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Gritty leather and raisin aromas suggest overripe fruit. In the mouth, this wine shows an expected jammy, plump mouhtfeel that's almost mushy. Flavors of blueberry, stewed plum and licorice finish loamy in feel and candied in flavor, with chunky weight and mild heat. Drink through 2016.",Spain,Red Blend
Cherry and raspberry aromas are lively and inviting. This wine offers plenty of body and good balance for the price. Flavors of candied plum and berry are not complex but have support from density and weight on the finish.,Spain,Garnacha
"Smells more meaty and leathery than you might expect for a basic, young Tempranillo. But enough berry fruit sneaks through to make it a solid but narrow wine driven by red plum and other standard red-fruit flavors. Finishes fresh but lean.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Young and a bit fiery at first, but give it time in the glass and it unfolds in a way that you would never expect for a wine of this price. Medium-bodied without any harshness, it has Mencía's typical soft tannins and berry compote flavors backed by a touch of char and vanilla. A super good wine that proudly represents Bierzo at the value level.",Spain,Mencía
A mile deep on the nose. The palate starts out grapy and jammy and then develops to show herb-infused plum and berry flavors. The finish of chocolate and black truffle ensures that this is a top-level wine. Drink now through 2014.,Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy and heavily toasted, especially upon first take. This is a serious multigrape wine from the outskirts of RDD that needs a few years in the cellar and then a decanting. With that TLC you will get saucy berry flavors, aggressive spice and tannins, and a dynamic, multifaceted finish. Drink it too soon or without airing and it may seem overoaked, hot and bitter.",Spain,Red Blend
"Now this is Albariño! The nose sings a pretty tune, backed by aromas of white fruits, candle wax and flower blossoms. The mouth is perfectly racy but balanced, with forward apple, mineral and honeyed flavors. Get at this as soon as possible to enjoy Albariño's classic crisp, oceanic qualities. You won't be disappointed.",Spain,Albariño
"Waxy and burning on the nose, and then very heavy and sugary on the palate. The orange marmalade and honey flavors are over the top and sticky, while the wine leaves an unctuous, resinous finish. Too much of this 15% Moscatel could cause a headache.",Spain,Moscatel
"With 20% Garnacha, this Navarran Merlot carries a green and lactic streak that makes it a tough go. The palate is gigantic and oversaturated, which makes the whole clumsy and rough.",Spain,Merlot
"A little more herbal, stalky and tomato-influenced than the riper, fresher 2005, but still an elegant, complex wine that shines a positive light on this little-known region at the base of the Pyrenees. Tobacco, tomato leaf, root beer and bouillon flavors set up an herbal, almost Bordeaux-like finish. Layered and structured to boot. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Full and dark, with aromas of bacon, crusty minerality, black fruits and spice. Balanced yet bullish, with integrated tannins and toasty, coffee-infused flavors that go straight to black. Long and showing additional coffee on the finish. Drinkable now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of leather, smoked meats, charred oak and lacquer are not for the weak, while the mouthfeel is firm, deep and just right. Juicy and bright in terms of flavors, with black cherry, vanilla and coconut. Toasty and alert on the finish, but with smacking tannins. Drinkable now and good for another four or five years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Fresh-cut oak is front and center on this now-aging blend of Monastrell and Merlot. There's a green, almost cheesy accent to the nose, which is followed by generic plum flavor. Always resiny and creamy due to the oak, with some prune to the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mildly raw and reduced, but at $6 expectations shouldn't be too high. In the mouth, it's tangy and light, with zingy strawberry/raspberry flavors that have some scour. Bland but lively.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raw and rough more than flush or lush. The nose deals mildly pickled red-fruit aromas in front of a tight, acidic palate that tastes of pie cherries. Firm and zesty but not much length or substance. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fizzy and foamy and aggressive. To give it a frame of reference, it is similar to Brachetto or Frascati from Italy, but it's clumsy on the palate and tastes too much like red licorice and candied fruit to be taken too seriously. Also a bit cloying on the finish. Imported by National Distributing Co., Inc.",Spain,Rosé
"Here's an affordable Bierzo red that earns big points for its straightforward, no-nonsense accessibility and balance. The bouquet offers ample minerality, a sprinkle of burnt toast and friendly red fruit. The palate is moderately deep and pure, with spice, pepper and vanilla on the finish. A fine reflection of the region and the 2005 harvest.",Spain,Mencía
"Old-vines Verdejo from Rueda can amount to something special, and this vineyard-select beauty has it going on. The bouquet is clean, with touches of saline, mineral and lime. The palate is mostly about freshness, but soon power and depth of fruit take over. And the finish is a whopper in terms of length and purity.",Spain,Verdejo
"Consistency is a virtue in this business, and this wine tastes almost exactly like the highly recommended 2005. The nose blends green grass and golden fruits, while the palate is clean, intense and snappy. This is a wine that sings, and the interspersed notes of bell pepper, grapefruit and mineral are just right for Verdejo. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",Spain,Verdejo
"Very dark and oaky, with lemon, bacon, charcoal and high-toned black fruit aromas. The palate is rich and warm, almost heavy, with intense blackberry, chocolate and figgy flavors. Shows very nice texture and size but also tips toward molten ripeness and heavy sweetness. Drink soon.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A well-made and refreshing wine for the price. The nose is crisp and smells of nettles, grapefruit, cilantro and stony minerals, while the feel is zesty and the flavors bring a mix of green fruits, citrus and tropicality. Stays on point from start to finish. A fine wine for summer sipping.",Spain,Verdejo
"A lot of wood sits up front, and in back of that things seem a touch murky and lactic. Freshness and precision are not this wine's best attributes, but there is decent weight and body carrying berry, tobacco and vanilla flavors. Would be better with more purity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard-driving aromas of smoke and graphite drown out shy fruit, while in the mouth the flavors are more distant than ideal. The feel is typically deep and and tannic, while a lasting flavor of chocolate is a welcome finishing touch.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Musky and leathery at first, with a hint of cough drop. And it never really gains its legs. The palate shows a pruny character along with some wayward acidity, while the finish is indifferent. Adequate but lacks elegance and appeal.",Spain,Tempranillo
"As pink wine goes, this Tempranillo-Merlot is extremely forward, heavy and aggressive. The nose is loaded with raspberry and cherry aromas, but there's also alcoholic heat reflective of its 14.8% alcohol. In many ways this drinks like a medium-bodied red wine, meaning it's fuller and beefier than your usual lighter-framed rosado. Imported by Dana Importers, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Baseball card bubble gum and leafy spearmint aromas shade dark, dusty fruit notes, while the tannic palate houses mildly tart cherry flavors followed by hints of sucking candy and finally coffee. Decent but a bit overoaked and out of sorts.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Torres claims to be serious about Ribera del Duero, but early on the Celeste wines, made from purchased grapes, are so-so at best. The 2004 is a touch damp and leathery on the nose, with toasty dark cherries as the driving flavor. It's got some weight but it's also drying and oaky on the finish. Needs some fine tuning.",Spain,Tempranillo
Pretty good except for some hardness and a touch of chemical that runs onto the finish. Along the way there are heavy aromas and rugged blackberry and dark plum flavors. Finishes full but drying toward the end.,Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts shy, but then reveals a smoky nose of dried cherries and freshly fallen leaves. Still fairly youthful on the palate, where plum and cherry flavors are braced by a ripping note of hickory smoke. Barrel notes take over on the finish, but overall it has a lot of what you want from a 21st-century Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Round and nutty, with mild floral and honey hints up front. The formula for Tio Pepe calls for a salty, crisp flavor profile with just enough complexity to thrust it into the upper echelon of finos. Slight mushroom and iodine notes appear on the finish.",Spain,Sherry
"An example of a well-made, lightweight red that puts clarity and freshness ahead of bulk and oak. The palate is racy and slick, with some peppery spice and milk chocolate along with pure cherry and raspberry. Finishes warm, tight and spicy.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"La Ina always has its own likable style. It's fresh, with plenty of apple character, and always dry as a bone. Maybe it won't overwhelm or surprise, but if served properly chilled, La Ina always satisfies. A quintessential aperitif with tapas and finger foods.",Spain,Sherry
"Sweet and candied on the nose, which  draws you in. Runs a touch chunky, with plum and licorice flavors. Good acidity creates a racy mouthfeel, even teetering on fiery. Tight on the finish, but crisp and fresh. The blend is 80% Cabernet and the rest Merlot.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Full and fresh, with pungent leather, tobacco and red-fruit aromas. On the mark in terms of feel, with laudable plum, cherry and earth-like flavors. Entirely holes-free, with ripeness that matches the wine's smooth texture.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Garnacha-Cabernet Sauvignon is the blend and it's showing some age. The nose is a little heavy and murky, and so is the palate. Flavors of melon and papaya are more plump than zesty and driven. Falls rather flat on the finish. Wait for the 2008.",Spain,Rosé
"All over the map. The nose offers toast offset by gym sweat, while the palate is both tangy yet pickled, with zingy orange flavors. The wine flows across the tongue but leaves a bit of citrus rind and vinegar. Not bad per se, but has some weak links. Imported by Winelink Imports.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Big in color, with meaty, rubbery aromas that seem reduced and gaseous. The palate is black and toasty, but sort of rubbery. Burnt toast, black coffee and some bitterness control the finish. More colorful and big than flavorful and complete.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A bit too rubbery and gassy to qualify as “clean,” with leafiness running the bouquet. The palate is sort of flat, with raisin, baked cherry and prune flavors. It's on the borderline of being stewed.",Spain,Red Blend
"Not super fruity. Instead it's a generic, racy specimen with lots of zap, kick and zest but not much style, warmth or fruit. Shows fiery flavors and a tight, driving finish. Expect many 2007s, including this one, to be on the miserly side.",Spain,Tempranillo
"As a young wine, this is bold, dark, crusty and slightly out of joint. There are salty, balsamic flavors along with muscular berry notes, and then butter and other barrel-driven flavors on the finish. It's chunky bordering on huge, with balance and integration issues. Maybe a little better in six months.",Spain,Red Blend
"Gummy, pasty and sweet, with no real elegance or finesse. It's simply a dark, candied wine that's pure tutti-frutti. And the feel is more narrow than one might hope for given the wine's immense color and body.",Spain,Grenache
"Toasty and rubbery aromas lead to a drastic, rather sharp palate of brazen red cherry and plum. More tang and pickled than rich and rewarding, with a fiery mouthfeel and scouring acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Leather, baked berry fruit and coffee make up the nose, while the palate is tight with cherry, raspberry and zesty acidity. This wine could use a few more years of bottle time, and then maybe that pronounced acidity will soften. If not, it is going to seem a little thinner than it should be for $125.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This wine shows Viura at its most elegant and expressive. It has weight, balance and body along with tangy lemon drop flavors. If you like pure but weighty citrus with a touch of mineral and brine, this has it. Better than most Viura by leaps and bounds.",Spain,Viura
"Young and vibrant; it's straightforward Albariño from a good vintage. In the mouth, expect green melon and stone-fruit flavors backed by solid acidity and a bit of fleshy weight. It's comfortable around the edges, and overall it's sure to satisfy fans of this type of crisp, clean white wine.",Spain,Albariño
"Nice on the bouquet, with aromas of licorice, tobacco, earth, mineral and solid berry fruit. The palate is a blend of power and smooth tannins, and the flavors of black fruit tilt toward fleshy, with buttery oak as an accent. A little flat on the finish, with herbal notes, toast and fig spread. Ready to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Initiates with savory, mildly soupy aromas on top of berry fruit. The palate is plump, ripe and balanced, with mocha, coffee and dark, meaty berry flavors. Toasty, dry and very solid on the finish, and convincingly rich as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Miserere offers most of what you'd expect from a high-end Priorat red. The nose features mineral, grilled meat, raisin, berry, cherry and even a citrusy accent. The palate has a full, complete feel and warm flavors of black cherry, licorice and raisin. Very nice but one step short of excellence. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Toasty, earthy, chocolaty and meaty, but not overly fruity or sweet. The palate features solid structure and body, with rooty raspberry, plum, nutmeg and other spice-based flavors. A little rough and short on the finish, with firm tannins. Gets better the longer it sits, so decant or let breathe before pouring.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Baked, roasted and earthy, with a deep palate of plum, berry and spice aromas. We wouldn't label this a complex or complicated wine; what you smell and taste initially is more or less what you get. Spicy and chocolaty on the finish, and satisfying.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Having not seen the Valsacro wines for several years, it's nice to know that they are up to good things. This is a dark wine dominated by aromas of cassis liqueur and earth. It's lively and structured, with layers of toasted berry, chocolate and black pepper flavors. Shows a lot of shadings and trimmings, including creamy oak on the finish. Drink now and over the next two years.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromas of mineral and jammy raspberry are attractive, yet the palate seems a bit metallic and clicky, with hard to penetrate flavors of rooty fruits, vanilla, coconut and cola. Opens with airing to display secondary berry fruit flavors in front of a tough, firm finish. Nice and ripe, and ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"Solid as a rock, with earthy berry and mild herbal aromas. The palate is firm and a touch angular, with sweet raisin, blackberry, candy and chocolate flavors. Long and steady on the finish, with a nice mix of freshness and richness that serves it well. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"Heavy fruit in the form of raisin controls the nose, while cranberry and rhubarb flavors anchor a surprisingly tart, red-fruit driven palate. Not sour per se, because there is core sweetness, but it just seems rough, snappy and sharp throughout.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light in terms of fruit potency, but heavy on the spicy oak. This is your typical dry, lean, somewhat shallow Tempranillo with spice and vanilla as the dominant forces. Some red cherry is evident in the mix.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Hailing from a more obscure mountainous region, this Chardonnay-based white blend is a potent brew. The nose offers pointed lime, citrus and cream aromas, which are followed by vanilla-tinged pear and spice flavors. Big boned yet clean, with a piquant finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Begins with mature aromas of toast, sugared pastry and yeast. Ultra dry in the mouth but flavorful, with almost sterile apple and spice flavors. Crisp but forgiving on the finish; a good match for poultry.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Impeccably clean, with light tropical fruit gracing the bouquet. A wine that's better than the sum of its parts; the palate is lemony fresh and satisfying, while the overall impression is that of elegance and simplicity. Perfectly good but not overly flavorful.",Spain,Albariño
"Sweet and grapy on first look, but shows more complexity once you get into it. Rich plum and other black fruits carry the bulky, sizable palate. The finish offers oak in the form of chocolate and mocha. Devoid of serious nuance and depth, but charming in an easy, fruit-forward way.",Spain,Mencía
"Leathery and smoky, with woodsy aromas as well as the essence of dried red fruits. Like many classic Rioja, it's a touch racy and acidic, but that zest pushes the cherry, cranberry and raspberry fruit toward an even finish. As a whole it's snappy, with a solid core.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The crude oil of PX Sherries, Noe won't appeal to everyone. For starters, it's thick as molasses, with heavy caramel and toffee aromas and flavors. And while there's nothing not to like about caramel and toffee, this wine is fat and chewy, arguably too viscous to drink with ease.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Starts with a big, dusty nose of cherry, blackberry and forest notes. Fresh and proper on the palate, with plum and boysenberry. Finishes with vanilla and toffee, while the feel is warm and round. Very functional and moderately complex.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's not a region or grape type that Telmo Rodríguez won't tackle, and here he's on to Moscatel in the deep south. This wine exhibits lilac aromas with hints of smoked ham and hard cheese. It's not a perfect bouquet, but it is intriguing. In addition, look for a bulky but rewarding palate featuring chewy sweet fruit and moderate acidity.",Spain,Moscatel
"Kicks off with a bouquet akin to chocolate-covered cherries before moving on to cured meat and bacon. Strawberry and cherry flavors are touched up by buttery oak, while the finish is so broad that it seems like pulled dough. Shows much of what's good about this appellation.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Begins with tight sulfuric aromas that transform into rubber and red fruit. Flavors of cherry, plum and dried herbs are tart and precise, while the finish offers some tomato. Overall it's a solid, tight wine that gets better with airing.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This well-priced red from Tarragona shows a glimpse of what the Montsant region can produce. The nose is all red fruit, with a splinter of oak. The palate is chunky and easy as it deals blackberry and raspberry in spades. Chocolate and mocha on the thick finish should please the sugar mavens.",Spain,Red Blend
"A different breed of cat. The nose is akin to nail polish and sweet perfume, while the palate is super simple and doesn't rise much above liquid candy. Not awful but not challenging or refined. Has a lasting simple jamminess that isn't elevating.",Spain,Garnacha
"Violet in color but sassy. The nose is pickled and brambly, while the palate offers crusty berry fruit and herbal, marinated flavors. Edgy and sharp as feel goes, with an angular, acid-driven finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Tobacco, spice and cranberry aromas mix with nutty leather and sweat. This is a tangy, choppy wine with more tomato and citrus flavor than ripe berry fruit. So even for fans of classic Rioja this will seem light, lean and leathery.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A little jammy up front, but mostly this is dull and bland, with generic citrus-inspired flavors and some bitterness late. Can't see this really helping out food or standing alone as an apéritif.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mami Mia, this is heavy stuff. The nose on this Garnacha-Graciano mix is muddled and rubbery, while the palate is saturated but murky. Finishes almost salty, with a hint of the veggies. A loud wine that doesn't really say anything.",Spain,Garnacha-Graciano
"No Time is the name but unfortunately there's no substance and no richness. As a whole, this Garnacha smells of bramble and pickle, while the palate is fresh and bouncy but sour.",Spain,Garnacha
"Despite basic strawberry and red licorice aromas, this wine is decidedly tart. It hits with snappy nectarine flavors and then turns citric and finishes up sour. Doesn't offer much rosé pleasure; makes you wonder what's the point.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flat and loamy on the nose, and then slightly floral. There is not much going on here; the palate offers distant strawberry flavors accented by pickle, and the finish is thin, tangy and hints at tomato. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This wine doesn't do much for Navarra's reputation as prime Spanish rosé country. It's a little burnt and acrid, with weak and muddled raspberry and pickle flavors. Finishes dry as a soda cracker.",Spain,Rosé
"This high-priced 2003 parcel-based Tempranillo hits with funky citrus peel and wet clay aromas, which are followed by cherry and savory, almost stewy berry flavors. The heat of 2003 is evidenced on the soft, hollow finish. It's a very good wine with character and typicity—but for $225?",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rooty smelling, with cola, sarsparilla, spiced meats and leafy berry aromas. The palate is plump and soft but healthy, with round, sweet berry fruit flavors and ample spice. A generous wine that's hefty, broad and ready to drink. Impressive given that its run is 45,000 cases.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An immense, heavily concentrated and sweet wine with aromas of bacon, wood smoke, citrus peel and jammy berry. The palate is rich and unctuous, so much so that it might qualify as syrupy in some circles. The flavors run toward roasted berries, fig paste and chocolate, and all totaled it's bold but a little overripe. Drink now.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Some patience is required to plow through the early aromas of cherry cough drops, bitter chocolate and smoke, but once you make it past that the wine turns decidedly red and fresh. The palate has tang and a citrusy quality, while flavors of zesty red fruits hint at lemon and pie cherry. A high-toned wine that's ready to drink now and over the next five years with lamb or beef.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of apple, fresh hay, pineapple and natural vanilla draw you in, while the palate is lively and fresh, with citrus, pineapple and pithy lemon flavors. Juicy, clean and zesty on the finish, and chiseled in terms of structure and acidity. Very nice Albariño for the price.",Spain,Albariño
"Black as night, with chunky, sweet, candied aromas as well as notes of bacon, shoe polish and cough medicine. This is a classic modern-styled wine with intense roasted berry, herb and exotic spice flavors. Licorine, prune, coffee and oak emerge on the broad finish. Very ripe yet it does a good job of straddling the line between big and overripe.",Spain,Red Blend
"Smells a lot like a pot of baked beans, meaning it's not that fresh and probably too earthy for most tastes. The palate offers mostly cherry tomato and green herbs on top of dried cherry, while the finish, which has a good feel to it, tastes too much like tomato.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flat, murky and mildly vegetal on the nose, and no matter how many times you swirl and sniff that's what comes out of it. Bottom line: it's a stewy, pruny Tempranillo with baked flavors and hard tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's really no good reason why a reserva from such a fine year like 2001 should be so thin and tart. But in this case, that's what we're dealing with. The nose offers earth, tobacco and red fruit aromas, but the palate is all acid and in the end everything seems stripped down and sour. Imported by Dana Importers, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A sweet, clumsy wine with gumball aromas in front of a funky palate that deals hints of vinegar and olives along with candied fruit flavors. Not a very good wine but drinkable.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With 14% Cabernet and Merlot added to prime Tempranillo, this wine jabs early with toasty oak, forest floor and roasted berry aromas, and then follows it up with full-bodied blackberry fruit accented by tobacco, leather and warm earth. It has body but also a firm, acidic core; and the tannins are totally manageable. Already drinking well but will improve over the next two to five years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Round, meaty, colorful and full of oak, chocolate and ripe fruit aromas. The palate is big and broad, with plum and boysenberry leading the troops. The mouthfeel deals some choppy tannins but all in all the wine has the right stuff, meaning it tastes fairly regal and offers a well-rounded feel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Viña Mayor has been around for ages; in 2005 its young wines show huge fruit, nuance and quality. This basic youngster rides high with boysenberry flavors followed by toast, earth and mushroom on the finish. Smells and tastes better than its price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Offers an attractive mix of herb, oak and ripe fruit aromas. The palate is sunny, and thus bright fruit in the form of raspberry and cherry shines. Full and lengthy on the finish, with chocolate as the lasting flavor.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Thinning, but with catchy aromas of leather, citrus peel, forest floor and cola. The palate offers sweeping dried fruits, mostly cassis and cherry. Meanwhile, the finish is tight and guarded by mature tannins and vital acidity. Interestingly, root beer and turnip show up at the very end.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A dud given that this is the winery's top effort. It's green and vegetal, with ashtray aromas. More like salad than wine. Not too many wines these days are blatantly bell peppery, but this is.",Spain,Red Blend
"This small-batch, single-vineyard heavyweight has a lot of stuffing, power and tannin, but it's also a rough ride, meaning the fruit and tannins hit like a jackhammer. But with good fatty foods and some decanting, the beast can be tamed. As for flavors, it delivers mostly plum and chocolate.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Having never tasted Heras Cordon's wines, the verdict is in: the current releases are all winners. This basic Reserva is lighter in frame, buttery and full of dill and red fruit; with air it settles to show ripe strawberry and raspberry notes as well as good structure. Perfect for drinking now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mineral, crushed flowers, black olive, dark fruit and herbs carry the hefty bouquet toward a round, earthy and fully packed palate that offers accents of cured meat, leather, creamy oak and some heat. It's definitely a big wine that's warm on the finish, but not tannic. A good deal at $16.",Spain,Mencía
"A nicely made and easy to like kind of young Ribera red with clean, bold blackberry aromas and flavors that fit the wine's big, tannic structure. Composed on the back palate and beefy on the finish. Perfect for grilled meats. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark in color and hefty for an '07, with vanilla, balsam wood and berry aromas. The feel and body here are appropriate, while the flavors of black cherry and plum are snappy, direct, pure and clean. Bold, lively and nice, but nothing too complicated or powerful.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"This is a higher-end blend from Onix, and it offers an earthy, almost compost-like opening with leafy notes of tobacco, coffee grinds, leather and hard cheese. The palate is solidly built, with cheek-blasting berry and coffee flavors. Toasty on the back end, with bitter chocolate. Very big but lacks some precision and purity of aromas and flavors. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Roasted and dark on the nose, with raisin, prune and exotic spice aromas. The palate is chewy and a bit lemony, with sweet baked fruit flavors and a load of chocolaty richness. Mocha and fudge are the key finishing notes, and overall this is a proper yet full-bodied big boy.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Big, bawdy, hard and concentrated, with black fruit and floral aromas. The palate is grabby and fully tannic, while the flavors run toward blackberry, coffee and vanilla. Rich and espresso-like on the finish, with no shortage of oak and richness. Very big at 15% alcohol.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Fruity, minerally and nice, with aromas of pear, apple and pineapple that make you want to take a drink. The palate is juicy and fresh, with slate-driven green apple and citrus flavors. Quick on the finish, with a revisiting of the wine's mineral component.",Spain,Godello
"Broad and rubbery, with ripe black fruit and citrus peel on the nose. Good on the tongue, with a solid mouthfeel. And the finish is   attractively marinated, offering hints of soy sauce, molasses and sea salt. Fresh enough, and definitely forward in thrust.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Chunky and ripe, with more power and potency than precision or finesse. Which still means it's pleasant, warm and tasty. The   palate offers ample raisin and toffee, while the finish is aptly spicy. Good heft and texture, but short in the midsection.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Looks good in the glass, and smells pretty nice despite a hint of barnyard. In addition, there's cola, vanilla and plum to consider. Fairly meaty in terms of feel, but not overly expressive and not quite reaching the upper echelon. Finishes with some gritty, hard-fighting tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Leathery and maturing, as the fruit seems to be on the fade. Dry cherry and raspberry notes carry the aging palate, which is bolstered by ample vanilla. Finishes warm, with licorice and pepper notes. Likable and more traditional, but drink soon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Quite hard on the nose, with classic petrol aromas that almost smell of rubber cement. Tough and tight on the palate; it takes some effort to penetrate. Once inside there's crisp apple and lime zest. A true “nature” in every sense.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Plump and fruity, with aromatics of tobacco, leather and dark fruits. Features sweet, sturdy black cherry and plum flavors before a finish of warm earth, plum and vanilla. Very straightforward in its approach, but solid on all accounts.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A bit of brett and barnyard on the nose, with minty raspberry coming on to take over. A little leafy on the midpalate, but not what you'd call green. Bitter chocolate carries the finish. A blend of five red grapes, a couple of which are local and virtually unknown.",Spain,Red Blend
"A touch grassy and raisiny at first, but soon it gets into step and shows cleaner, fresher spice and cherry notes. For an average vintage, this is a nice wine with pepper, mildly jabby tannins and lots of oak. With air it settles nicely, and with food it should make for a good partner.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Hard smoke and raspberry aromas are balanced and pure, and the mouth is ripe, juicy and bright. This makes its point with subtlety and smoothness. It's not a bumpy, aggressive wine as it holds its balance all the way to the end.",Spain,Mencía
"Nice Albariño, no ifs, ands or buts. The nose is floral and clean, and that's backed by a no-fuss palate of citrus, namely orange and grapefruit. As it holds form from front to back, you know this is a good wine. Will go great with light salads and shellfish. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"Floral and lighter bodied, with attractive red fruit aromas and a modicum of exotic spice. The palate is tight, pure and a little sharp and pointed, while the flavors are of flashy, zesty raspberry. A juicy wine that treads lightly rather than with a hammer.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Leafy and spicy, with notes of paprika, tomato, dried leaves and broth. But in the mouth, it's fresh and vital, with good balance and flavors of dried cassis, tobacco and herbs. For an older wine from industrial Valdepeñas it's doing a good job. But now is the time to drink it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smoky and dry, with aromas of tire rubber and mildly herbal, leafy red fruits. The palate has a dry, rugged, scratchy feel while the flavors veer toward baked raspberry, earth notes and coffee. Finishes nicely, with berry fruit at first and then herbal, oaky afternotes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark and very toasty, with espresso, bacon and roasted black fruit aromas. Tight and drying in the mouth, with biting tannins, a lot of oak and finally mildly herbal flavors of blackberry and burnt toast. Hard and dark, but big and boisterous, with a blatant barrel influence.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Leather, tobacco, citrus peel and herbs make for a controlled bouquet that doesn't smack you in the face. The body, however, is tannic and grabby, while the flavors of sweet berry carry a roasted angle and a dash of spice. Chocolaty and spicy on the finish, but again it goes down hard and tannic, which is a drawback.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Very sweet and rich, and probably a little too much so for some folks. Aromas of cassis, berry liqueur and black fruit candy are sweet, sweet, sweet, but after the sugary richness subsides you do get a dark, brooding, mammoth Garnacha with prune, chocolate and baked power. A 15.5% heavyweight to drink before 2011.",Spain,Garnacha
"Alluring bubby, regardless of origin or composition. The bouquet is dry, clean and spicy, with crushed raspberry. Full in the mouth, with a perfect texture; the peach and nectarine flavors are delicious. Finishes a bit racy and citrusy, with pink grapefruit and passion fruit. Outstanding rosado cava. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Seems a touch green and stripped at first, but airing brings it around. Still, there's a lot of fresh wood and resin, which somewhat masks the plum and berry fruit that's eager to emerge. Spicy on the finish, with a decent feel.",Spain,Red Blend
"Meaty on the nose, with chunky leather aromas along with mature fruit. In the mouth, it's a touch racy and acidic, which serves to bolster its raspberry and pie-cherry personality. Pretty good overall, with a sizable allotment of zest.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lean on the bouquet; there's almost zero yeast or lees character. But there is an interesting smoked-meat aroma that conjures memories of sausage or ballpark franks. Aggressive in the mouth, with green herbs and paprika. An unusual cava with confusing characteristics.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Quite aggressive and murky at first, with a gassy, heavy bouquet of leather, earth and cooked plums. A lot of dryness comes out on the palate, courtesy of starchy tannins and medium-weight red fruit. Finishes with grip, size and a heavy hand. For best results, give it as much time as you can.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Saucy and mildly seductive, with aromas of herbs, leather and exotic spices. In the mouth, however, things seem a touch rustic and burnt. The palate carries some serious zing and spice, but to call it smooth would be a stretch.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fat and melony on the nose, with tons of pear, cantaloupe, almond and vanilla on the palate. Heavily oaked, especially on the finish, where wood resin is mostly what you get.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Riper and deeper than some in this class, but arguably overoaked and roasted, such that the finish tastes like burnt coffee and the bouquet smells of peeled tire rubber. In between look for plum, blackberry, cumin and black pepper.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This basic RdD delivers a smooth, ripe nose with doses of forest, bacon, road tar and violets, and there's some plum and blackberry at the foundation. Juicy and raw on the tongue, with racy, slick blackberry fruit. Finishes broad and medicinal, likely a sign of the hot vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This starts with a strong blast of black olives, leather and blackberry, followed by condensed fruit flavors and a tinge of black cherry. A nice wine with character, but for $80 it comes up short of thrilling.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"All in all this is a perfectly good wine. But in this pricey class and category we get picky, and we're finding some reduced, raisiny aromas and a slightly flat, edgeless mouthfeel. However, we do like the wine's berry and plum core and its intensity; too bad it's not more evenly balanced.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dense and fairly earthy, with a big coating of chocolate and char courtesy of full-force oak. The palate is dark and heavy with blackberry fruit, compact tannins and some burnt notes, while the finish is a little salty but long. Not stellar but showing a lot of qualities.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rich and a bit syrupy on the nose, with pepper and black cherry notes that keep things moving along. The palate is deep and round, with broad tannins housing beefy dark-fruit flavors and reasonable depth. A stocky wine that's ready to drink now or over the next few years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with black fruit aromas, dry oak and spice. The palate shows an oaky creaminess, sticky tannins and solid berry fruit flavors that are matched and maybe even trumped by buttery oak. A little dry and drawing on the finish, but still a very nice RDD.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"A black wine with aromas of graphite, molten earth and black fruit. The palate is a pounder with strong tannins and blazing acidity, and that creates a mouthfeel with grating intensity and roasted black fruit flavors. Lively late, with herbal notes and a lasting tannic bite. At over 15% alcohol, there's a lot of fire and toughness, so hold for a few more years and hopefully the tannins will soften.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flowery and fresh, with a bit of talc and creaminess to the bouquet. A little soft in the mouth, but still wet and likable. Flavors of lemon-lime and celery are solid, while the finish is dry and peachy. Treixadura, Godello, Loureira and Albariño comprise the grape blend.",Spain,White Blend
"Tropical smelling, with green banana, minerality and firmness to the bouquet. The palate is clean and cleansing, which are two very different things, while the wine tastes of tangy citrus and green melon. Fresh, tropical and uncomplicated. Drink this year.",Spain,Albariño
"This smooth, stylish wine is on the way up, as evidenced by the two-point bump it's receiving from its last review, in December 2004. Today it's round and full, with aromas of hay and popcorn that draw you in. Layered through the middle, with expressive white fruit, dryness and sweetness all in one. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Bulky and ripe, with raspberry and punch-like aromas. If you like sweet notes like kirsch, sugar beets and coulis, this has it. Clearly the wine reflects the hot vintage, so it's soft, chewy and bent on sweetness. Good, but not an ager.",Spain,Red Blend
"A bulky, fruity style of cava that begins with aromas of floor polish, fruit essence and roasted corn. Shows much more citrus in the mouth, where the flavors run toward orange juice, lime and tarragon. Crisp and apple-based late, but never exciting enough to stir fandom.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Typically amber in color, with aromas of dried cherries merging into apricots. Tangy and sharp on the palate, as is standard. Neither fruity nor deep, even according to Tondonia's track record. Newcomers may not be impressed.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Extracted and raw, but with enough rustic country charm to make it worth a go. Four major grapes were thrown together, yielding cherry, beet and tomato aromas. The palate is ripe and edgy, with red plum and herb flavors. A tight, basic wine with ample tannin and acid.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Shows hickory-style wood aromas along with jerky, briar patch and cherry. Fairly fresh and forward, with a tangy palate dealing standard berry-cherry fare. Tight on the finish, with chocolate, pepper and coffee notes. A cut above the mass-market products; quite acceptable for the price",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Clean, pure and a touch slight, but fine in terms of minerality and zest. This is nice with lots of melon, lemon verbena and almond notes. It finishes very long and nutty, showing good acidity. Drink as soon as possible for best results.",Spain,Albariño
"Molasses, saddle leather and black olive aromas add complexity and masculinity to the bouquet, while flavors of black cherry, roasted plum and vanilla fit correctly into the wine's meaty, firm style. With obvious oak and raw tannins, this wine is still kicking and should drink well for another three to five years.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Crisp, green and friendly, with aromas of celery and fairway grass. The palate also has some green to it, namely celery and edamame, but there's adequate melon and grapefruit to balance things off. The finish is dry and pithy, with a lasting flavor of pink grapefruit. Imported by USA Wine Imports, Inc.",Spain,Verdejo
"Standard but nicely done. This is a solid representative of 2001, and it's showing nice, mature cherry flavors along with integrated tannins, vanilla and an easygoing plumpness. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Minerality is a major player in this peachy white blend that throws off some salinity and pool water on the nose. The palate has a round balance to it, while the flavors of lemon-lime, pineapple and mango get it done. Fresh and melony on the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Colorful and fresh, with a bit of latex/Band-Aid on the nose to go with bacon, raspberry and oak-based maple aromas. The feel is stout and chewy, while flavors of cassis, cherry and chocolate work well together. An oaky customer but a good and tasty one. Drink now and over the next two years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly earthy and herbal, as Somontano reds are prone to be, with a gritty mouthfeel and sweet black fruit flavors that come with proper herbal accents. Tastes roasted and toasty, with pepper and heat on the lusty finish. Balanced and good; drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"Clean, solid aromas of black cherry and berry are just what you want from Spanish Monastrell, and while this isn't the most unique or original wine, it sure is tasty, balanced and pleasing. Flavors of lightly baked black fruits are lush, while the finish is medium-long and easygoing. Hard to find anything wrong with this affordable red from Alicante.",Spain,Monastrell
"From Freixenet, this is perfectly good yet familiar, which for $15 is about as good as we can expect. The palate is juicy and also smooth, with red berry, tomato and herbal flavors. There's good depth and balance throughout, and the finish rounds into form and closes things out in a tasty, subdued fashion.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Perfectly approachable and wholesome. Aromas of bread dough, pear and lemon-lime are alert and attractive. The palate provides a lush bowl of kiwi, apple and pear, while some citrus coats the finish. Imported by European Cellars.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Exhibits dry red fruits and mushroom on the nose, with accents of forest and spice. Somewhat minty and forward on the palate, and arguably a touch gritty and sweet. Raw as it might be, no one can say this wine doesn't have guts. Imported by The Marchetti Co.",Spain,Garnacha
"Not a bad little quaffer. From Martinez-Bujanda, this colorful, ripe red is solid and chunky, with sweet aromas of berries and black plum. It is what you would call straightforward, with little to no complexity but lots of girth. Finishes full, almost creamy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"More heavy and ripe than expected, with a creamy, almost lactic nose. Round on the palate, with plum and black-cherry fruit. Good acidity and overall balance keep it afloat. Finishes with coffee, chocolate and spice. Not a world beater but good.",Spain,Mencía
"From Bodegas Bretón, this medium-weight red is a touch stewy, with peanut and black-olive aromas along with red licorice and Tootsie Roll. The palate offers strawberry and red cherry, while the finish is surprisingly tangy, with a shock of overt acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Bright apple, pear and pineapple aromas are indicative of the sharp white fruits this wine has to offer. The flavors of apple, pear and lime are refreshing, and like any Txakoli it hits with quick jabs and a lot of zest. Drink now.",Spain,Hondarrabi Zuri
"Dark berry, spice cake, savory leather and roasted meat aromas give this a deep, brooding, heavy exterior. The mouth has acceptable acidic kick for Toro, while the flavors are saucy and meaty, with licorice and earth notes. Not overly fruity or lively; it's more meaty and thick.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"The nose of red fruits comes with oak, mocha and toast, while the palate is crisp and tight, with juicy, dry red berry flavors and backgroud notes of chocolate and spice. Seems like an Old World throwback due to its leaner body and an emphasis on dry spice and acid-driven red fruit.",Spain,Tempranillo
"More tan in color than the usual light yellow, with true aromas of flower blossoms, lemon and tropical fruits. The acidity is a bit pronounced and scouring, but that only means that the citrus and green apple flavors cut and cleanse. Juicy but modest when it comes to depth of flavor. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"A bit rubbery and earthy, with compost, smoky bacon and black fruit aromas. Nicely balanced with a good mouthfeel, and showing solid berry and plum flavors. Peppery on the finish, with some roasted overtones. Perfectly good for a tough vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light as if it were even older than it is, but nicely perfumed and mild in scope. The nose is mature and woodsy, while the palate is light, acidic and still dancing with plum and cherry. Best if you don't expect too much from it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit sweet on the nose, with notes of caramel, blackberry and earth. Better at first, where it comes on ripe. But then it turns a little sluggish and heavy as it opens. Still, it's largely a good Rioja, maybe more in the “modern” style than old-school.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Rich and creamy, but lacks zest and drive. The nose and palate offer sweet banana and oak, while the feel is almost too pillowy. Tastes more like a dessert than a dry white should. Still, it's neither bad nor poorly made.",Spain,Chardonnay
"More minty oak than fruit on the nose, with simple but clean candied fruit flavors. A bit short on depth and complexity, but totally drinkable, especially after some airing. Decent texture to the finish, with leftover spice and wood-based flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Starts with appropriate earth, cherry and vanilla notes, which are followed by spicy cherry, cranberry and raspberry flavors. Shows red fruit in a more traditional style, while the finish is warm, a bit oaky, and ultimately quite fresh.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lean and woody, with mint, herbs and sawdust on the nose. The palate is surprisingly saturated and healthy, with pepper and vanilla running side by side with dry cherry and raspberry. A bit scouring and tannic.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Light and limpid, with mild almond, palm butter and citrus aromas. This is a basic, clean wine that offers citrus, pineapple and mango flavors. It's a bit sweet and monotone in its delivery, but it doesn't offend and it goes down easy if properly chilled. Imported by Martín Códax USA.",Spain,Albariño
"Earth, leather and mildly stewed aromas greet you, and right away one can tell this wine came from a warm vintage. It has integrity and depth but maybe it still couldn't escape what 2003 threw at it. Why do we say that? The acidity seems higher than normal, maybe because of early picking, and it lacks the pure-pleasure quotient that we look for in higher-priced Bierzo wines.",Spain,Mencía
"For a value-priced wine this scores well. The nose offers a nice mix of earth, warmth and berry fruit, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of zesty berry. Composed on the finish, which is also fresh and lively. Perfect for by-the-glass or casual consumption.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Chiseled aromas of lemon-lime and spring flowers are lean but clean, and that pretty much describes this blend of Treixadura, Torrontés and Palomino. Lime and green banana are the key flavors, and the finish brings back lemon-lime and minerality. More basic than flashy, but nice in a neutral way.",Spain,White Blend
"The packaging and name are a little contrived, but what's in the bottle stands up to scrutiny. The aromas are warm and plummy, with a hint of toast and cream. The palate is clean and juicy, with snappy black raspberry fruit and a fruity carry-over onto the finish. Spunky, fresh and pleasant.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The sweet, rubbery nose deals earth, herbs, smoked meat and richness, while the palate is candied and big, with sweet, medicinal flavors of blackberry and black cherry. A touch lactic on the finish, but otherwise the wine is alert and ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mildly pickled and stemmy at first, with earthy compost aromas that fade and are replaced by raspberry and other berry fruit scents. The palate has snap and smacking tannins, with flavors of raspberry, cherry and a staunch buttery dryness. Brambly but with enough good fruit and body to make the cut.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A clean, easygoing style of Albariño with salinic aromas along with apple and peach. The palate has a perfectly good feel to it, while the flavors of citrus and peach are a little plump and sweet. Finishes with tropical notes and pithy white grapefruit.",Spain,Albariño
"A mature, more traditional Spanish wine that's ready to drink. The nose mixes tomato leaf, mint and maturing berry aromas, while the starchy, grabby palate shows aging raspberry and strawberry fruit with ample leather and dryness. Caramel, vanilla and toast notes grace the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Roasted berry, marzipan, prune, spice and earth are rolled into a solid whole on the bouquet, while the palate rides on the heavy side with grating tannins and deep but clumsy flavors of blackberry, raisin and fruitcake. Smooth but not complex or demanding. Chewy and bulky, which isn't uncommon for Toro.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"More open than many, with lemon-lime aromas that work as a nice entry. Full in the mouth, where mixed fruits mesh together. The back palate offers drier citrus on top of a smooth, creamy body. Finishing notes of green herbs and lettuce are welcome. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Regal in presentation, with its faux-metal label and broad-based bottle. And in every edition it's one of Spain's more elegant, serious cavas. Look for slightly toasted, charcoal-based aromas backed by ripe apple and sweet citrus flavors. Very good feel and length. One of Spain's truly consistent high-end bubblies. Imported by Freixnet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Toast, butterscotch and oxidized apple aromas precede a heavy, nearly overripe palate loaded down with sticky apple, nectarine and banana. Where it does well is in texture, which is correct and pleasant. Finishes long and heavy. A different breed.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Earthy and ripe, with jammy, borderline stewy fruit that carries a meaty edge. Fairly one-line in terms of complexity, but it stands on its feet and tastes pretty solid. With some rustic character, it'll do the job.",Spain,Rhône-style Red Blend
"If it seems dirty at first, time will reveal tobacco and leather aromas along with black plum and coffee. Seems more sour than you might expect, with pie cherry and rhubarb flavors. Really high-toned on the finish, where it teeters on the brink of sour. Not bad but not endearing.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Tons of color but the nose is a bit soupy, with aromas of heavy oak, black fruit, tomato and herbs. A blend of 60% Garnacha and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that's solid but shrill. Hits with extract and tannins, but the integration and flavors don't quite achieve the next level.",Spain,Red Blend
"Plump and a bit stewy, but the flavors manage to take over in a fairly positive way. Upon sipping you take in blackberry and prune, but also some murkiness. Not much in the midpalate, but decent around the edges.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Muddled to start, with chocolate and earth aromas along with heavy, seemingly chewable berry fruit. Big on the palate, with slightly overripe plum backed by overt vanilla and brown sugar. A three-grape mix of Prieto Pecudo, Mencía and Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Hints of peanut and caramel vie with mineral and acacia blossom for center stage on the nose, while the palate deals nut skins, lime, kiwi and gooseberry. In the end, this is a tangy, streamlined wine that's refreshing. It has some style but it's mostly just racy and lean.",Spain,Albariño
"This is a nice, traditionally styled Rioja. Delivers smooth, earthy, leathery aromas and then spicy dry fruit that's right out of Rioja 101. With good acidity, it's a very respectable table wine from a weak vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A recommended entry-level Ribera, with aromas of violets, minerals and oak. The palate has a standard, competent feel and balance along with flavors of gangly berry fruit and black cherry. Mocha and vanilla help sweeten and soften up the finish, but overall it's a regular, fresh type of wine.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Aromas of black fruits, light oak and violets are good but basic, and that pretty much defines the rest of the wine. Expect an easy flowing palate with candied, regular berry flavors in front of a light to medium finish. Nicely done and approachable.",Spain,Monastrell
"A jammy, fruity, extracted Tempranillo with simple, candied berry aromas followed by a heavy, bulky palate that's packed with warm berry fruit. A rich, young, jumpy sweetie that's designed to make you happy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice and prickly, with aromas of nettles, citrus and minerals. The palate is fresh and acidic, while the flavors of green apple, scallion, pineapple, lemon and grapefruit come together well. Clean and not overly acidic on the finish. Varietally speaking, this is on the money.",Spain,Verdejo
"A full-bodied red blend from Montsant. The nose is big and smells of black cherry, licorice and herbal, foresty notes, while the palate is saturated and grabby at the edges, with herb-tinged, roasted-berry flavors. Snappy and cheek-starching on the finish; drink now through 2011.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fairly big and yeasty, with earth and mushroom notes that offer complexity to the apple and pear aromas that dominate. Fruity enough, with hints of nutmeg and white pepper. Richly texured with a ton of body. Roundness is its calling card. Imported by Winebow.",Spain,White Blend
"Maybe Pinot Noir isn't meant to be in Catalonia. This has a burnt nose, with medicinal cherry and cranberry aromas and flavors. Starts sweet then goes a bit raspy. Unusual.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Heavy and high-voltage, with a strong whiff of green bean to the nose. Flavors of raisin, raspberry and green pepper combine to create a palate that has its high moments as well as its faults. Tight on the finish, with lots of tobacco and bell pepper.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A Monastrell with 10% Cabernet, and it is heavily minty and woody, with leaner than expected fruit and a whole lot of resin and vanilla setting things off. Decent structure and mouthfeel, and with plenty of oak. Not bad but nothing too exciting.",Spain,Monastrell
"Some heft and richness propel this bargain wine to a higher level. There are even some bacon, beef and leather aromas in addition to the plump fruit scents. Chewy and chunky, with flavors of black cherry and raspberry. Yet still tangy and refreshing enough to avoid being clumsy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not too refined, but still pretty tasty. The palate offers chewy cherry and raspberry fruit, while the finish is spicy and zesty to the point that it creates a tingle. Somewhat sugary, but definitely an easy one to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"Nice in terms of texture, but a bit strange and hard to identify as far as aromas and flavors go. The nose tosses up Sherry and syrup notes, while the flavors run toward Granny Smith apples and lime. Shockingly, the finish is sweet. Confounding and hard to appreciate, but not a bad cava.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A blend of 65% Merlot with 35% Tempranillo;  the nose offers olive, black plum and a touch of resiny young oak. Black fruit, coffee and juicy acidity work the palate, and then some medium tannins and grab come up late. Not that complex but entirely satisfying, and consistent with past vintages that offered very good value for money.",Spain,Red Blend
"Serious and true-to-form Verdejo, with dry lime and green fruits on the nose and lots of green apple, apricot and citrus in the mouth. This wine packs a lot of flavor and power into a fairly regular, unadulterated package. And that's basically why we like it. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"Fresh as can be, with pure aromas of nectarine and cherry blossoms. The palate is light but refreshing and lithe, with semisweet, punchy flavors of orange, peach and pith. Finishes clean and light in the classic, subtle, utilitarian way that a good Rioja rosé should.",Spain,Rosé
"Warm, lightly baked aromas of berries and earth give this a common, likable bouquet, which is backed by a proper feeling palate and flavors of plum, mulberry, earth and herbs. Settles well on the finish, with good length and more than adequate purity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Fairly dense and slightly herbal on the nose, with balsamic notes, dried cheese and mature fruit aromas. This is still spunky and well composed in the mouth, with flavors of tobacco, earthy berry and toasty oak. Shows weight and grab on the finish. An honest, mature wine to drink now; it's not going to improve.",Spain,Garnacha-Cabernet
"Nice on the nose, with berry aromas, ample richness and rubber. The powerful palate delivers big-time blackberry, toast, roasted plum, coffee and chocolate, while the finish is also chocolaty and stout in structure. Chunky but tasty. A good Jumilla wine consisting of 85% Monastrell and 15% Syrah.",Spain,Monastrell
"A chunky, thick, earthy type of wine with syrupy, sweet berry flavors and a friendly palate that's tannic but not too much so. Caramel and carob mix with coffee and cola on the finish, and overall it is good RDD if you don't mind full extraction and syrupy richness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A Priorat blend made in a softer, more simple style. The nose has plum, prune, licorice and rooty scents, which precedes a thick, sweet palate that has mild tannic grip and flavors of raisin, black plum and wild berry. Plump and broad, with good depth.",Spain,Red Blend
"Good for a mature wine but it does smell a bit flat and damp. That murkiness blows off somewhat, leaving a solid, aged Rioja wine with acidic zap and lightly baked berry, cherry, tomato and spice flavors. Mild on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy smelling, with slightly murky baked berry aromas. The palate is juicy and snappy, with strawberry and raspberry flavors that carry a bit of richness. Becomes sweeter as it opens, with vanilla and fresh tomato and herb accents. Reliable as always.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sweet yet snappy, with youthful aromas of candied fruit. Slightly tangy on the tongue, with raspberry and plum flavors. Tastes clean, with a soft mouthfeel. Very standard, simple and easygoing.",Spain,Red Blend
"On one hand it shows black cherry, plum and licorice. On the other there are green, lettuce-like aromas and flavors. Along the way is some tang on the palate, length to the herbal finish, and an adequate mouthfeel.",Spain,Red Blend
"Black in color and saturated with plum, fruit cake and vanilla aromas. Big in the mouth but clumsy, with dense, thumping black cherry and blackberry flavors. In fact, everything about the wine is black, including the burnt, licorice-tinged finish. Ponderous in the long run.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A little heavier than ideal, with a touch of raisin along with candied black cherry on the bouquet. Better in the mouth, where it comes to life on the wings of good acids, modest tannins, and simple but proper berry fruit flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts somewhat cooked and stewy before finding a better, fresher, fruitier groove. Weighty and full, with bright colors and aggressive flavors. Plum, berry and cherry notes dominate. Persistent airing unveils additional ripeness and soft tannins.",Spain,Red Blend
"Very sweet, with cherry cola and licorice nibs comprising the nose. It's nothing more than simple Garnacha, which means it's all about red fruit and sunshine. Not a fine wine, but good for those with a sweet tooth.",Spain,Grenache
"This co-op wine is almost a good deal, but ultimately it does not show enough depth or elegance to reach the next level. The nose is a touch stewy and lifeless, while the palate offers chewy raisin, plum and berry. Flat on the finish, with a syrupy feel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Round and smooth up front, with fairly pure berry aromas along with hints of leather, chocolate and warm earth. You are getting your money's worth with this  medium-rich, balanced, semicomplex wine. The feel is right, the tannins smooth but present, and the finish touched up by coffee and mocha.",Spain,Red Blend
"Full to the tipping point, with sweet aromas of pears and peaches. Is it over done? Maybe a little, but in between the folds of very ripe fruit there's some mineral and citrus pith. Bottom line: the funky blue bottle catches your eye and the wine is fine. But the 2005 cost $15 and this one is going for $28. Can somebody please explain the drastic price hike?",Spain,Albariño
"The west-central plains of Spain get hot and that heat is evident in almost every Ribera del Guadiana wine I've tried. In this case, the prune, leather and dry earthy aromas are controlled and solid, as is the blackberry flavor that works the palate, which is full, tannic and offers pretty good feel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Salneval is the so-called baby Albariño from Condes de Albarei, and it's lively and complete. Aromas of honeydew and peach nectar are appropriate and welcoming, while the apple, orange and pineapple flavors are fresh and agile. A wine for salads and seafood.",Spain,Albariño
"Basic and fresh, yet not very individual in its aromas or flavors. The nose is your standard mineral and snappy citrus, while the palate offers nice apple, lemon and grapefruit flavors. It's more of tangy, cleansing wine than anything deep or cerebral. Drink now with salads or grilled shrimp.",Spain,Verdejo
"A sweet, raisiny old-vines Garnacha with candied aromas and a fat, chunky body that houses soft, short black fruit and peppery flavors. Tastes like licorice candy on the finish, which brings some heat and burn as well. An interesting Grenache that is sweet but isn't over the top in terms of ripeness.",Spain,Grenache
"Rusty in color, with initial aromas of smoke, dried leaves, herbs, tobacco and subtle berry. That all indicates that it's not overdone, and thus the tobacco, earth and dried fruit flavors are par for the course. Dry and leafy on the finish, which indicates that now is the time to get at it.",Spain,Garnacha
"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather. The palate has a nice, ripe, bodied feel, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry bring just the slightest hint of herbal green. Toasty and solid on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas. The palate has good snap and verve to it, while the feel is on the lean side. Flavors of baked berry, earth, caramel and coffee ring true, and the dry, toffee-tinged finish is a nice ending. Ready to go now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Round and fruity, with sweet, attractive aromas. The palate is a bit dark for cava, with plum and bitter chocolate flavors. The feel is soft and foamy, with a dry, roasted note on the finish. Clear as can be; easy to tell that it's Pinot Noir. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Open and floral, with acacia and orange blossom on the nose. The palate is full-bore citrus, dealing orange and pink grapefruit. Lots of acidity and still full-bodied, with a solid finish that's zesty and lasting. Nice brut cava; offers more than average. Imported by Classical Wines.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Crisp and clean, thus it qualifies as a perfect apéritif wine. Secure in its apple and slate aromas and flavors, with a firm but persistent bead that fosters a fine mouthfeel. Best with nuts, olives, chips and especially seafood.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Nice and fresh, with defined, attractive apple and pear aromas. Dry and fruity in the mouth, with a tad of sweetness to the firm papaya, lime and apple flavors. Ripe and round enough, with balance. The total packagein cava. Imported by Classical Wines.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Spicy and inviting on the nose, with no shortage of oak. The palate holds that spiciness as bramble and some tartness enter the fray. More of a ready-to-go food wine; it doesn't really have the depth or complexity to go further.",Spain,Mencía
"The color and mouthfeel on this modern-styled, expensive Rioja are both very nice. On the palate, it's cushioned and healthy, with smooth tannins and proper acidity. But aromatically and flavorwise, the wine is green almost to the point of vegetal. And there's only so much tobacco leaf, bell pepper and rosemary that one should have to take. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection, Ltd.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The bouquet of cassis, liqueur and molasses would seem to portend a lush, deep, very ripe wine. But emblematic of the cool, wet 2002 harvest, this wine is crisp to the point of sharp, with oak coming up late and on the finish. Falls off with more time in the glass.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Big and chunky, with mild aromatic hints of bell pepper and green tobacco mixed with plum and berry. The flavor profile more or less matches the nose, while the mouthfeel is full and easy. For the most part this is easy-to-drink with full tannins and a healthy outlook. It's a blend of six grapes, including Tempranillo, Garnacha, Merlot and Cabernet.",Spain,Red Blend
"Some hot radiator dust and carrot juice aromas impact the nose, while the zesty palate features orange, cherry skin and other racy flavors. This is a classic Navarran rosé that starts out better than it finishes. Best to drink it right away and well chilled.",Spain,Garnacha
"Opens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors. Warm, simple touches of licorice and mint define the finish. A blend of 60% Monastrell with 20% each Syrah and Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fresh berry aromas carry some spice notes, while the palate is rugged and a little hot. Juicy berry flavors are forward but not overly evolved or complex, and the the finish is tight and aggressive. Spunky and clean, with honest flavors.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A solid but seemingly standard blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha with berry and cherry aromas along with touches of mint and leather. The palate is woody, with spiced berry flavors and decent body and structure. Vanilla and then oak-based bitterness define the finish. A good wine but hardly a knockout.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Tight and largely neutral white fruit aromas show a little apple but little more. The palate is friendly and easy, with melon as the lead flavor. Turns more citrusy and weighty on the finish, which fades fast.",Spain,White Blend
"One of the best $7 wines you'll find from Spain. The nose is bright, medicinal and floral, while the palate is loud and peppy, with sweet red fruit flavors that sport a candied coating. Fresh, tasty and simple, which is what it should be. 60% Bobal and 40% Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Easygoing and balanced, with cream soda and vanilla aromas setting up orange, tangerine and green apple flavors. Crisp and right on the palate, with flowing acidity. Solid, with a touch of green herbs. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Melon, honey and white stone-fruit aromas carry the nose, with a touch of sulfuric match stick sneaking in late. The palate deals good lime, citrus and spiced apple, and while the finish is lean and short, it's also clean and scouring. A nice wine for near-term consumption.",Spain,Albariño
"The greeting is nothing but pure green coconut, and that essence of powerful, almost overpowering oak persists all the way through. Along the way, and amidst the resin and sawdust, the wine offers dark fruit, potency and flash. But the depth isn't here, thus the wood stands out.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This granular, mildly earthy Toro falls into the everyday category, but within that market segment it'll do just fine with steaks, burgers and lamb chops. It offers viscosity, blackberry fruit and a long, chocolaty finish. It's not ultrarefined but it has plenty of stuffing and kick.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Full, roasted and earthy on the nose, with only some coconut and berry aromas to sweeten things up. Tight, level and structured in the mouth, with roasted raspberry and plum along with oaky, buttery, smoky accents that confirm the wine's “roble” designation. Good but with some excess oak to process.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Floral, spicy, semi-oaky aromas precede a tangy, fresh, higher-acid palate with snappy raspberry and red cherry flavors. There's an abundance of pop and snap to this medium-bodied wine, and then drying woody notes to the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of balsam wood, dry leather, and slightly herbal berry fruit are generally appealing, while the palate has size, balance and a healthy feel to it. More woody and spicy than outright fruity, with a touch of zesty raspberry and strawberry at the core. Nice but simple red wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous. The palate is well balanced and the flavors run sweet, ripe and chewy, with berry fruit and creamy licorice notes on the finish. A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Garnacha from Catalonia.",Spain,Syrah-Grenache
"Aromas of cactus pad, green apple and jalapeño are true Verdejo, while the palate brings citrusy, melony fruit as well as chalky, minerally dryness. Tastes a bit like white grape skins, with tangerine and lemon on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Opens with a blast of cola and minty grass, and then comes a raisiny wave and mossy herbal notes that are typical of Navarran Merlot, which makes up 60% of this three-grape blend. Gritty in the mouth, with black cherry, licorice, herbs, raisin and lasting sweetness on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Once you get by the early sulfur this is mostly a nicely made, chewy Garnacha that has brawn and balance before going a bit hot and stewy on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"A heavier, sweeter style with cider-like aromas followed by apple and lime flavors. In the mouth, this is a more citric wine that may go well with shellfish. It's sturdy and zesty, but not that evolved. Tasted twice, with this note reflecting the better of the two bottles.",Spain,Albariño
"Starts with a crusty, almost mineral top over oaky, chunky blackberry fruit. It's a standard, semiherbal, juicy red blend (75% Tempranillo) with flavors of dried cherry and mocha. Short on the finish, with a hint of vanilla and chocolate. Good overall.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Light and dominated by red fruit from the nose to the palate to the finish. Along the way are edgy accents of spice, stem, citrus and dry oak. Among all the big bruisers out there today, this is more from the old school, meaning it's fresh, lithe and crisp.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts with punchbowl aromas of berry fruit, flowery scents and candy. The palate has a good freshness to it along with snap and flavors of cherry, plum and berry. Nothing complicated here; just a juicy, fresh wine that's likable and not overpriced.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with good berry fruit aromas, mineral notes and coconutty sweetness, which is followed by a plump, well-balanced palate of black fruits, plum and licorice. Finishes solid and warm, with enough vitality and juiciness to maintain balance. More or less what you want from affordable Monastrell.",Spain,Monastrell
"On the plus side, there's a smoky, meaty set of aromas. But on the down side, there's a rubbery character reminiscent of burnt tire tread. That rubbery element passes through to the flavors, which also bring roasted berry into the fold. Rustic stuff with just enough bold berry fruit to make it worth a go.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Begins with muddled, murky, syrupy aromas of caramel and berries. The palate is more high-toned, with lemony accents to tomato, baked fruit and savory flavors. Finishes solid albeit lightly damp and bitter. Comes around with time but always seems a bit murky.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Roasted and mildly leafy, and then clacky and a bit tannic in the mouth. The fruit flavors are good and mostly pure as they settle on black cherry and blackberry, while the finish is jammy but short. For $8 this should not disappoint.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This new wine from the Torres group is a little heavy and baked on the nose, but once you get it onto the palate there's depth, mouthfeel and solid flavors of savory fruit, soy, rubber and dark berry. Dry on the finish, with a mounting note of coffee. Not overly fruity or sweet, which may be a blessing for some palates.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Apple to start with, with some sweet doughiness to ease things along. Rather crisp and dry, which is all very classic. Flavors of white grapefruit and lemon are laser-like, while the finish is tight, almost sharp. Good quality; a little short. Made with Chardonnay and Parellada. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Spain,White Blend
"Classic and austere, with light toast and vanilla aromas in front of stark green apple and lime flavors. A natural dosage on a cava will result in tartness and sleekness, and here that's definitely what you get. Imported by Classical Wines.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Typical of many 2002 Riojas, this packs a punch but doesn't hit many high marks. The nose is heavy and dark, while the plum and cherry flavors that carry the palate also have touches of green and bramble. Ample oak covers the wine and its weaknesses, and in Roda's skilled hands the wine isn't bad.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The nose is floral and tropical, while the palate is clean, zesty and full of melon and papaya. For a basic, straight-ahead wine with no acidic curves or oaky bumps, this is commendable. Best if served well chilled, and in less serious settings.",Spain,Chardonnay
"With this Airen and Macabeo blend you'll get almondy aromas in front of apricot and peach flavors. It's a solid, fairly well-balanced wine that won't hurt your budget or your appetizers.",Spain,White Blend
This is a nice little Viura (with 15% Chardonnay) that smells nutty and smooth and tastes of tangy citrus and other white stone fruits. It has more acidity than body and it locks onto that citrusy profile and doesn't let go. But overall it's a good quaff for the price.,Spain,Viura
"Clean and fresh, and isn't that the first prerequisite for any decent rosé? The palate offers citrus and peppery apple skin flavors, while the finish is long and loud. Pretty good Garnacha that's ready for the summer and early fall. Drink now.",Spain,Garnacha
"Concentrated, willing aromas of black cherry and sweet plum are nice and friendly, while the palate is lively, juicy and a little tart for Garnacha, with an emphasis on red raspberry. The wine dries out a bit on the finish, leaving vanilla and spice. Good enough for a basic Aragonese red.",Spain,Garnacha
"A pretty good Tempranillo-Garnacha blend with simple but fresh berry and plum aromas. The palate has snap but no overt acidic bite, while flavors of cherry and berry are slightly herbal and end with a mild buttery accent. A touch flimsy but keeps it together.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Standard black-cherry aromas carry a candied, vanilla-like twinge, while the feel is juicy and snappy. Flavors of sweet berries and cherry are just fine, and they come with a nod of spice and bitterness. Punchy and fresh overall, with good ripeness and balance.",Spain,Garnacha
"Creamy and yeasty, with mild apple and bread-based aromas. Nice in the mouth, with citrus leading the way. Shows ample kick and acidity, with length and balance on the finish. Perfectly good overall, if not overly exciting. Imported by Bon Vivant Imports.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Different from the crowd. The nose concedes light raspberry and cranberry aromas, while the palate is a pink passion play that's not that easy to figure out. It's tangy, with citrus and berry mixing in an unconventional manner. Interesting in the mouth; a quality wine. Not run of the mill. Imported by De Maison Selections, Inc.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Termanthia is the pinnacle of Tinta de Toro. Aromas of wild blackberry, crude oil, forest floor and truffles are just now showing themselves, while the tight, tannic palate is full of black plum, blackberry and bitter chocolate flavors. Espresso and roast meat notes grace the dark, jam-packed finish, and as a whole this is one bold, boisterous wine. Best in 2011 thru 2013. Only 531 cases.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Round and sweet, with heavy buttercup and honeyed aromas. This is what we call a candied Albariño; it's loaded up with canned pineapple, melon and mango. The feel is plump and the acid level fairly low. Ripe and ready as it's ever going to be.",Spain,Albariño
"While not that distinct, there's nothing wrong with this plump blend of 70% Verdejo and 30% Viura. The wine offers standard green melon and apple flavors, with sweet grapefruit notes on the finish. Better in the near-term; drink well chilled.",Spain,White Blend
"A touch saucy and soupy to start with, but airing sends it to a better place. This wine falls into the chunky and ripe category, with good but heavy black cherry and black plum flavors. All the way through it's a wide load, but generally speaking an appealing wine to drink now.",Spain,Garnacha
"Blackberry and raisin with a sharp smokiness carries the nose. The palate is not overly generous, but it does house berry, spice and vanilla flavors along with some clipped tannins. Has the components but not the harmony. Imported by Newton Land Development, Inc.",Spain,Mencía
"Deep purple in color; this is a classic young grapeball across the bouquet, with sweet candied fruit aromas. The palate is plump and full of youthful blackberry flavors, while the finish is moderately chewy and substantive. Not a finesse-driven wine by any means; but good if you like simple, forward fruit character.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raisin, baking spices and other soft, cooked aromas set the stage for a dense palate that's easy but flabby. In between the folds there's molasses and raisin flavors backed by a soft, fading palate. It's a sweet and inoffensive wine, but one with little future.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dry and piercing on the nose, and then crisp and snappy on the palate. For those opposed to overextracted, heavy reds, this could be up your alley. More modern-influenced palates will probably find it a bit lean, stripped down and tart, especially for Toro, which is known for bigger, riper wines.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Punchy berry aromas are floral and jumpy, and the palate is more sheering and tart than expected, but still fresh and clean. Zesty black cherry flavors are softened by buttery oak, and the finish is racy. Could use more flavor and depth along with less acidic bite.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"A better wine than the label's varietal Garnacha, so it seems as though the Tempranillo brings character and elevation. Wild berry and cherry aromas mix in citrus and spice, while the palate is fruity, with pepper and soft spice flavors. Turns a touch tart and toward cranberry the longer it's open.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"A little bit dark and crusty on the bouquet, with murky, earthy black cherry aromas that get clearer and cleaner with air. Briary plum and cherry flavors are solid if nothing else, and the finish is basically more of the same, with length. A competent wine, but that's where it ends.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty, lightly oaked berry aromas are entirely regular, while the berry driven palate is dry, drawing and oaky, with pretty good body but stand-out acidity as well. Tastes a bit woody and peppery late. A highly generic wine that makes you wonder why it costs $30.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Light and lean, with lively fruit aromas and flavors. Freshness is what this wine pushes, because there's not much weight or overt sweetness to it. Light apple, a touch of pear, and some lemon-lime is the most that you're going to get. Still, it works as a palate freshener. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dense and dark, with huge black-fruit aromas, toasty oak, chocolate and balsamic notes. Numanthia is ripe, rugged and intense, with in-your-face black fruit, coffee and burnt-toast accents. The feel and finish are deep as a cool well, and smooth as a whistle. Masculine to the max, and pretty close to being ready to drink. Best to hold until the fall or winter. 12,000 cases made.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Functional Rioja Reserva is what this is. The nose starts out smoky and powerful, but the fruit is lean and on the snappy and tart side, with orange peel and cherry skins getting into the game. For a stellar year like 2001, it's surprisingly lean and basic.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bierzo in northwest Spain is best known for the red Mencía grape, but here we find organic Godello with hay, corn and other slightly overripe aromas. To continue on the theme, the palate is a touch baked and soft, with spongy melon and papaya flavors. A pliable wine that may already be past its prime. Imported by Newton Land Development, Inc.",Spain,Godello
"Super dense and hard as a rock, with bacon and black fruit aromas that lead straight to a saturated, chewy, tannic palate that pounds away as it delivers blackberry, coffee, licorice and other huge flavors. As big, baked and heavy as they come, with gargantuan tannins. Includes 15% Syrah in addition to Monastrell.",Spain,Monastrell
"Smells sort of gummy and candied, with aromas of red licorice stick, raisin and raspberry jam. The palate is sizable but comes with racy acidity, thus the flavors veer toward red fruits with an herbal accent. Burns a little on the finish due to sharp acids.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lightly stemmy and brambly, with lean red fruit aromas, a touch of saline and red licorice candy. The palate is lean and sort of scratchy, while the flavors are suggestive of red apple skins and red plum. Tight on the finish; similar is some ways to a simple Chianti.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef. It's super-chunky on the tongue, with dominating roasted black fruit flavors. It has its merits but is still too blackened for our liking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cherry and dusty cinnamon aromas blend with a touch of cough drop on the nose, while the full-bodied palate pits spicy berry and plum against rather soft acidity. Finishes sweet for a burst, then dry and peppery. Alluring rosado. Imported by European Cellars.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dark, rubbery and focused on the nose, while the palate is wider, richer and propped up by a band of zesty acidity. The flavors are typical of Toro, meaning dark blackberry and boysenberry. A finish of brandied berries, kirsch and chocolate is almost like dessert.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Astrales has really nailed it the past couple of years, and while the '06 isn't quite as good as 2005, it's still an excellent wine. Blackberry, tobacco and cocoa aromas lead into a stacked flavor profile of boysenberry and plum. And on the finish it expands and brings vanilla and fudge into play. Drink now and over the next six years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lush and full-bodied, this Tempranillo from vines more than 65 years of age handles its size gracefully, with precise flavors of blackberries and peppery spice rounded out by hints of vanilla and tobacco.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Nothing earth-shattering here, but this Garnacha is sweet and syrupy, with jammy berry and black plum flavors. It's totally round and soft, with no hard tannins or confounding complexities. It's a sound, uneventful red wine.",Spain,Garnacha
"A little too much canned fruit cocktail and grapefruit juice on the nose, but overall it's generous with its sweetness. The palate offers ripe nectarine, although the feel runs perilously close to being cloying. Better if you don't mind some stickiness to your white wines.",Spain,Godello
"Dark and resiny, with aromas of leather, black olive and jammy berries. The palate runs quite sweet and without the backbone needed to prop things up. Hence the mouthfeel is lacking and the finish peters out quickly. Tasty enough, but short on feel and structure.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Frankly this is nothing to swoon over. The color is salmon and the nose is like matchstick sulfur. The wine is surprisingly sweet for being 80% Tempranillo and 20% Garnacha, and it's borderline cloying on the finish. Has its moments but I'm not really sure what the point is.",Spain,Rosé
"Gold in color, with papaya, almond and orange on the nose. The palate features a heavy mix of citrus and apples, and in the end it's a style that leaves you questioning its intention. It's dense and wet, but also reduced and clumsy.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Noticeably sharp and a touch green on the nose, with earthy, richer accents such as leather and chocolate making an appearance. The mouth is tangy and lean, with strawberry and raspberry flavors. Very un-Toro in its skinny, tight approach.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Spice and warm leather on the nose are worthy aromas, but there isn't much fruit and the palate runs gritty and acidic. It's got freshness and fairly good purity; but it's also kind of narrow.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Uncomplicated and dominated by red fruit aromas and flavors. This is your everyday type of red wine that could probably be made from just about any grape or blend of grapes. Here, Tempranillo and 15% Shiraz make for a dry, mildly oaky red with freshness and little else. Fine if you're not looking for anything special.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Opens with peppery, earthy black cherry and berry aromas, yet the palate is clacky and narrow, with high acidity and dry, limited flavors of blackberry and black cherry. Narrow as well on the finish. Middle-of-the road and respectable but hardly a head-turner.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little herbal and minty on the nose, but at this price one can't complain too mightily. The palate smacks down with bite and acidity, while the flavors run herbal and a little stemmy, with caramel as a backdrop. Roasted and herbal but not offensive, especially at $7 a bottle.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Heavy, minty and smelling of shoe polish, barrel char and black licorice. The palate is chunky but overall it has pretty good structure. Meanwhile, the flavors of raspberry and plum carry a heavy oak influence. Spice and resin, additional reflections of the oak, dominate the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rather barnyardy and gaseous at first, but air breathes more clarity into the nose. The palate is chunky, grabby and a little awkward, with herbal, medicinal black fruit and buttery flavors. Slight heat and burn hamper the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Big and bold stuff from southern Spain with burnt, hot aromas of roasted black fruits and stems. Better on the palate, where it brings plum and berry flavors but also some heat and saline. Slightly stemmy and roasted on the finish, much like the bouquet.",Spain,Monastrell
"Yellow in color and heavy on the nose. Toast is the lead aroma, and with that there's some caramel and peanut butter. Dry and lean in the mouth, with lemon and grapefruit notes. Still, it has class and style to it; not a dullard. Fairly unique. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The Evo '05 is composed, lively and impressive. The tobacco, coffee, leather and balsamic fruit aromas are lovely, while the berry, plum, herb, chocolate and tobacco flavors are integrated and graceful. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"Don't expect a lot from this fruity but fading blend of Treixadura and Albariño. It offers heavy green plum and melon flavors, yet it's losing steam as it turns heavy and briny.",Spain,White Blend
"Sharp and sweaty on the nose, with bulky passion fruit, scallion and citrus flavors. This wine is on its last legs; it's soft, fleshy and starting to lose its final vestiges of freshness. You'll be better off waiting for the 2006, assuming it gets to market soon.",Spain,Albariño
"Rubbery and not all that convincing on the nose. The palate is sizable but also acidic, which leads to a tart, almost sour flavor profile that is dominated by tangy cherry skins and citrus zest. Imported by Newton Land Development, Inc.",Spain,Mencía
"Strange that a 2006 wine will already seem old, but thus is the bane of Somontano, a region striving for better wines but not always hitting the target. This Macabeo-Chardonnay blend goes heavy on the melon and apple character, and in the end it teeters on cider-like.",Spain,White Blend
"Dark and chunky, but also salinic and clammy smelling, with black fruit aromas sitting in front of a palate of salinic, woody, baked fruit flavors. The tannic finish is hard and edgy, and there's some heat too. Has its high and low points.",Spain,Monastrell
"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.",Spain,Albariño
"Light to medium aromas of cherry and berry are fresh and snappy, while the palate has high acidity, light extract and crisp, almost lean flavors of cherry and red plum. A pointed but clean wine that will do well with simple foods like sliced ham or salami.",Spain,Garnacha
"A touch green smelling, with aromas of coffee grinds and earth. Tannic in the mouth, and then hollow in the middle, with green-leaning, leafy flavors of blackberry and cola. Roasted on the finish, with burnt coffee and chewy, bitter tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rubber and plum aromas are accented by cinnamon spice notes on this fuller-sized, somewhat sticky but basic Garnacha. Dark in color and slightly herbal in terms of flavors, with tart cherry and a slightly dilute feel to the finish. Basic but honest.",Spain,Garnacha
"Basa has long been one of our go-to whites from Rueda, but this vintage seems to be on the slide. The nose is oily and short, while the fruit is turning toward bitter. It still has some vitality and green fruit character, but our advice is to wait for the 2009. A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo.",Spain,White Blend
"Light berry aromas carry a citrusy edge, while the crisp palate is lean but clean, with dry, peppery plum and cherry flavors. There's not too much body or complexity here; it's juicy, a little metallic and highly regular. 60% Tempranillo and 40% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Jammy smelling, with raisin and cough drop aromas. The palate maintains that jammy profile, while the flavors run creamy and short, with a lean toward strawberry and raspberry. A little grassy and green on the finish, with a final dose of candy.",Spain,Red Blend
"The nose is all dense blackberries, while the palate is deep, flashy and ripe, with flavors of black cherry and blackberry. If you like big, bold wines, then this one should strike you in a good way; it's saturated and dark, with a touch of vanilla and mocha on the finish. Great balance for such a big wine. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A blend of 55% Tempranillo, 20% Cabernet, 20% Merlot and Syrah. But in the end it comes up a bit barnyardy and bretty, with animal aromas giving way to a racy, almost lemony palate that also offers some wild raspberry. For $35 it's scattered and faulty.",Spain,Red Blend
"Peppery raisin is the dominant aroma on this condensed, sun-baked wine that surprisingly shows spiky acidity and a rugged mouthfeel. Seems like the winery was shooting for a riper, bigger style than its regular Vega Esteban crianza, and that heft and kick don't really help.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A strong whiff of wintergreen cements the wine's herbal status; it seems as though the grapes were likely picked to beat the heat but maybe weren't fully ripe. Hence the wine shows lean strawberry and raspberry characteristics, and always there's that shot of green.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Peppery and tough smelling, with tomato-leaf aromas. This is a bland, innocuous wine with a touch of berry sweetness on the midpalate but no complexity or follow through.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"A native Basque white that's way past its prime. Txakoli wines barely last a year and need to be attacked very young, and this '05 is pretty much DOA. It still has some character and perfume, but it's getting heavier and duller by the minute. Look for the 2006 or wait until the spring/summer for the 2007.",Spain,White Blend
"Lemon peel and citrus aromas are the proper foreshadowing of what's to come: a tart, lean, old-style wine that is ultimately lean and grabby. These days you have to give the consumer more richness and flavor than this.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Burning hay field, roasted corn and other over-the-hill aromas put this one on life support. The palate isn't much livelier; there's dry, bland citrus and more canned corn. Not a total mess but not very fresh or attractive.",Spain,White Blend
"Macabeo, Gewürz and Chardonnay all in one...and what's the point? The wine tastes of apricots and other chunky fruits. Basically it's unfamiliar stuff that doesn't strike a chord despite the fact that it seems reasonably well made.",Spain,White Blend
"The number of good, even palatable, varietally bottled Gracianos is small. This is typical of what you usually find: lean flavors, spiky acidity and even a chemical burn to the nose.",Spain,Graciano
"A wine in discord. The nose shows raisiny P.X. Sherry hints, while the palate is underdeveloped and tart. Shallow and almost too sour.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Acceptable, but barely. There's a strange citric, grassy tinge to the nose that makes it smell like Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. And it tastes pickled and briny. Decent mouthfeel and sensory balance save it from even lower depths.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Shows yeasty, earthy, dusty aromas, with just a slight trace of fruit. There are also mild fruity flavors. It's slightly sweet as a semi-seco should be, but has adequate acidity and decent length finishing with some richness.",Spain,Champagne Blend
"A bit strange smelling for Rioja in that the nose deals a mix of candied berry aromas along with stemmy, herbal, compost notes. The palate is thick and chewy, while the flavor profile includes lightly baked, creamy berry and roasted accents. Stocky and fruity but with issues.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Starts out with gassy, earthy aromas that suggest heat and barnyard, while the palate is chunky and full, with stemmy black cherry, plum and berry flavors along with coffee and chocolate accents. Delivers power and length but not much in the way of character or complexity.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A mix of standard berry fruit and leafy, herbal qualities is the starting point. Next up is a tangy, acidic palate of red fruits, vanilla, acidity and ultimately some bitterness. Short and gritty on the finish. Tastes and smells like mass-market Bordeaux. A blend of 60% Tempranillo and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Light and lemony, with a hint of green astringency. Tangerine with hints of mushroom on the palate run toward a solid but lean finish. Has zest but little roundness. Fresh and crisp, but not the most friendly bubbly.",Spain,White Blend
"Not every wine is easy to read: this one is a case in point. The nose offers sweet toffee and apricot, while the palate starts out toasty and dry before unveiling ripe peach and brown sugar. The dosage on this wine is unusual. A funky bubbly that's worth a try.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Over a year ago this wine rated only 86, but bottle age has improved it, and now its condensed nose of black fruit and chocolate mint chip is very pleasing. The palate is ripe and offers blackberry and cured meat, while the finish delivers licorice, pepper and a touch of salami. Proof that wines do change over time, and that sometimes we underrate the youngsters.",Spain,Red Blend
"A forward wine with earthy aromas, leather and a hint of Navarra's herbal essence. The palate is full-bodied and complete, with balanced weight and tannic structure. Flavors of dark berry and black plum are deep and mildly roasted, while the finish is meaty and chocolaty. Chivite Colección 125 is often Navarra's best red wine, and that appears to be the case in 2004.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The excellent 2005 Azul is stout and secure, with a ripe, clean and modern bouquet that's backed up by a chewy, toasty flavor profile that pours on the black fruit and character. With roundness, tannic grip and good acidity, this wine is in perfect balance and is delivering the most it can. Tempranillo, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Prieto Picudo is a variety unknown to most wine drinkers. And that's probably a good thing, because the grape yields acidic, tight, astringent wines like this. Yes, there's color and size here, but there's not much balance or charm.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"Bland as they come, with tangy white fruit and green veggies doctoring up the palate. Try as you may, there's just nothing much to latch on to. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Spain,Viura
"Very red in color, an ominous indicator of what's to come. The aromas are close to raisiny and baked, while the palate sort of lugs along. There's nothing terribly offputting about this wine, yet it doesn't offer any thrill or chill.",Spain,Garnacha
"Licorice, pepper and raisin join forces on a can't-miss bouquet that's all Monastrell and all southern Spain. Dark and candied, with tons of cooked brown sugar. This is what you'd call big and tannic, with a hard, grabby mouthfeel. One glass we can recommend; two or more might be tough to handle.",Spain,Monastrell
"Loud and basic, with ripe fruit aromas and flavors but also a detectable heaviness. The palate pushes ripe apple and pear, while the finish is big but quiet. Deep and dense but dull along the edges.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Hot, earthy aromas settle on leather and tomato, while the palate is gritty and tastes of dark, smoky, chunky black fruit. More tangy and angular on the finish than desirable, with limited depth. Standard stuff on its best day.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Warm and smelling of menthol, cough syrup and sweet, jammy berry fruit. The palate is also fairly medicinal in terms of flavor, while the feel is a bit hard and underdeveloped. Turns more tart and herbal the more you get to know it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stemmy and leathery smelling, with heat, roasted fruit and cheesy aromas. The palate is full but soupy, with roasted, baked black fruit flavors. A bit of cinnamon and spice help out the finish, but by then the wine's very average fate has been sealed.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A little burnt and leathery smelling, with stem, bramble and raspberry aromas. The palate is sheering and tight, with semisharp acidity enlivening herbal, peppery red fruit flavors. As a whole, there isn't a lot of substance here to weigh.",Spain,Garnacha
"Clearly this isn't a vintage for long keeping. In fact, one of our usual favorite Ruedas is already on the downslide. The nose is chunky pineapple and the palate is dull and wayward, with flat, pithy citrus. Lacks the vibrancy José Pariente is know for. Wait for the 2009.",Spain,Verdejo
"Full and boisterous red wine, with a ton of natural ripeness and a high pleasure quotient. We have always liked the Abadal wines, and this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend gets both sides of the Old World/New World argument right. It's loaded with dark berry and earth aromas, which are followed by cola, blackberry and chocolate flavors. An alert, acid-driven wine with enough depth to impress.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"With its dried-cherry and rose-petal aromas and flavors, this beautiful, mature red is every bit the equivalent of a fine, older Bordeaux or Burgundy. Cumin and cinnamon show on the palate and the refined finish is lovely, with anise and white pepper accents.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The bouquet of dried cherries, plums, prunes and tobacco opens to a palate of dense fruit that's dry and structured. This wine is big, but even textured and not heavy. Shows finely focused fruit and good grip. The dark fruit flavors add spice accents on the long finish. Cellar Selection.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Deep, sweet dark-cherry fruit forms a solid foundation for this impressive wine. There's a touch of menthol oak on the nose; plenty of leather and earth accents in the mouth, coupled with good acidity, keep the palate complex and lively. Finishes long, with full—but not harsh—tannins. Editors' Choice.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Beautifully balanced, this shows all the positive attributes of mature Rioja. Though 30 years old, it is still very alive, with deep sweet fruit that wears tobacco and meat accents. Anise accents the ultrasmooth palate. Full of complex flavors, with a lingering finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Minty and herbal smelling, with stemmy, generic fruit aromas. The palate is sticky and creamy, while the flavors are chunky, flat and lean toward herbal berry. An oaky, syrupy wine with a mild green streak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flat and fleshy smelling, with little zap and only soft green fruit aromas. The palate maintains some tang and citrus, while flavors of lemon and tangerine are chunky, loud and lean toward bitter on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Pineapple aromas lead to a soft, smooth, but lifeless palate of slightly bitter melon and banana flavors. Pithy on the finish and short on pulse. Drink immediately or let it go by altogether.",Spain,Verdejo
"Nothing special about this blend of Tempranillo and Shiraz. In fact, it's more austere and less pleasing than the brand's basic 2007 Temp-Shiraz blend. That said, this wine shows thin raspberry flavors and a tangy, almost sour back end. Probably best with food; not real good on its own.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Cherry and mild sawdust aromas are brought down by sharpness that is almost vinegar-like. The palate has an acceptable mouthfeel along with sweet and sour flavors of plum and berry. Tart on the finish, and a bit stemmy and sharp throughout.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earth, rubber and chunky black fruit aromas make for a heavy, muddled nose, while the medium-sized palate is stewy and briary, with jammy flavors of red fruits and rubber. More stewed and medicinal than anything.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe, dark, a little oily and totally compelling from an aromatic standpoint. The palate is right where it should be, as neither the tannins nor the acidity are out of whack. Boysenberry, blackberry and plum flavors carry an herbal touch, and the finish is layered, with a lasting impression of coffee.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Purple in color and meaty on the nose, with a hint of raisin and reduction but not too much. Due to the heat of 2003, this is a ripe, rich wine with big plum and berry flavors but also good balance and feel. It covers all the bases and finishes in a smooth, solid, stylish way. Just reaches the cut of excellence.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Avinyo does not make cookie-cutter cavas, and thus this wine is out of the ordinary and not always the better for it. The nose is lean and spritzy, with aromas equal to lemon-lime. The palate is drawn in for a brut, with tart flavors. Slim in profile, but not a bad or indifferent wine.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Nose of ripe spicy fruit with tobacco and earth accents. Similar full, chewy flavors ride the plush mouthfeel. The long finish is dense and dark.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sharp, medicinal and a little skunky to start with, and it remains acidic, tangy and hard in the mouth, with cranberry and cough medicine for flavors. Herbal and cutting on the finish. Not much to write home about.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells like wet cement, spearmint and light red fruits. The palate is dilute and acidic, with tangy, citrusy flavors of raspberry and cherry. Citric on the finish as well, although on the plus side you could say it's crisp and mostly fresh.",Spain,Tempranillo
"While this wine doesn't really appeal to us, we can envision fans of Old World, leaner, more acidic wines signing on. What we see, however, is a light-bodied, high-acid wine with tart, lean raspberry and cherry skin flavors and a sour finish. Fresh for sure, but hollow and in need of more.",Spain,Monastrell
"Gassy smelling and candied on the nose, with medicinal, jumpy cherry aromas. The palate is hot and hard, with underwhelming, semisour plum and berry flavors. Herbal on the back end, with a weak, faux buttery aftertaste.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Green to the point of being vegetal, with bell pepper and green bean aromas in addition to hidden berry fruit. It's grabby and tannic across the palate, while the flavors run toward green fruit and caramel. Deficient and hard as nails.",Spain,Tempranillo
"As in previous years, this wine just isn't that fresh and pure. The nose is briney, and the palate follows suit. There's some chunky grapefruit to ponder, but there's unavoidable pickled, vegetal notes come finishing time.",Spain,Rosé
"Dusty cherry aromas start out full and turn more green and grassy with time. Sweet grapefruit and tang carry the palate, and the finish is a rush of acidity. Good but odd.",Spain,White Blend
"Full and heavy, with mango and orange juice flavors. Creamy in the mouth, with a full, foamy feel. Good citrus and apple characteristics keep it moving forward, while the weight is definitely there. Good in cava cocktails or as a Spanish mimosa.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is classic Rioja Reserva, with textbook cherry, earth, leather and meaty Tempranillo flavors supported by a good acid spine and moderate tannins. The elegant finish is dry and spicy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Candied on one hand but also gassy, barnyardy and less than clean and pure on the other. A basic mouthfeel is probably the high point, while flavors of underdeveloped berry fruit are more salty and leathery than anything. Fails to impress.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Funky smelling and unfamiliar, with sweet, candied spice notes and strange candied cherry aromas. Vibrant and bouncy in terms of feel, but follows the nose by tasting sweet and weird. Weak on the finish as well.",Spain,Garnacha
"Smells like compost, and never does that earthy, stenchiness lift. The palate is thick and muddled, with wan, dry, buttery raspberry flavors that lack direction. Finishes dry and bland, without much structure.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells candied as well as burnt and stemmy. The palate is adequate on the surface but hollow in the middle, with dry, herbal raspberry flavors. Tastes more stemmy and distracted the longer you play with it. Not ready for prime time.",Spain,Monastrell
"Dull aromas of raspberry and plum skins turn sweeter with air, but the palate is too centered on thick, creamy, generic berry flavors that turn raisiny and chunky with time. Not grabby or cloying, but even so this wine doesn't hit many high notes.",Spain,Monastrell
"Jammy, sweet and extremely raisiny, with a nose that matches the palate. Low in acid, so low in pulse. Pruney on the finish and seemingly overripe. Not well balanced.",Spain,Garnacha
"Colorful but aromatically defined by lean, green alfalfa, which doesn't portend much good. The palate is hard and underwhelming, with herbal, almost green berry fruit flavors. Similar on the finish. A 200,000-case product that comes across like a 200,000-case product.",Spain,Red Blend
"Only if you enjoy very lean, ultrafresh and tart red wines will this work. It starts with simple punchbowl aromas of red grapes and berry, and then comes a skinny, tart, grating palate that's all acid and no substance. Calling it “traditional” or a “terroir” wine would only be misleading.",Spain,Monastrell
"A weird wine in every way. The nose smells like something off the grid, with briney fruit, funky spice notes and compost. Creamy and oaky in the mouth, with herbal flavors and a dash of nutmeg and/or cardamom. Hard on the finish, and just too strange to bother with.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A burnt, stemmy nose is an indicator of what's to some. And while the palate has an o.k. feel to it, the flavors here are bitter, herbal and burnt. A wine that lacks freshness of fruit.",Spain,Monastrell
"Sweet cherry and dried-rose notes on the nose are offset by some noticeable barnyardy scents. Elegant, but less generous on the palate and decidedly drier than the much older 1970, this finishes with dry tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stemmy, brambly raspberry aromas lead to a scouring, light palate of snappy, sharp-tasting red cherry and plum-skin flavors. Lean to the point that it's almost sour, and overall it's stretched extremely thin.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Burnt smelling at first, and tart throughout, with pie cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors. There's not much to measure here; the wine runs sour and tastes mostly of red fruit skins and citric acid. 65% Tempranillo and 35% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Way too charred and roasted. The mouthfeel is acceptable and ranks as the best part of the wine. The rest is just a burnt, charred, overoaked mess with flavors of earthy berry, leather, peanut and resin. A poor effort that makes you wonder what the winery was thinking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flat and gaseous smelling, with sulfur and no fruit to speak of. Tastes like bland nectarine and tangerine, and the body and finish are almost flabby. Borderline in terms of its acceptability.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Soft, chunky and fading fast, with aromas of asparagus and canned green beans. The palate is flat as a board, with vegetal flavors and bitterness on the finish. Barely worth a sip at this point in its evolution.",Spain,Verdejo
"If it weren't for the wine's stout color and pretty good mouthfeel, we'd sink it. The nose is green and cheesy, and the flavors are also green almost to the point of vegetal. Stemmy on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Heavy and definitely on the mealy side of the fence, and fighting for any semblance of balance. Pithy as well. Sadly, the citrus fruit in this wine is not that appealing.",Spain,Godello
"Quite sweaty, oily and hard, almost like an underdeveloped Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is also on the bitter, oily, pithy side, with only a little grapefruit and orange working their way through.",Spain,White Blend
"With pretty flower blossom aromas mixed with lemon verbena, the nose on this Albariño is very nice. There's body and weight, but balance, too. Melon, citrus and mineral flavors are clean and satisfying, and the acidity is bright and entirely food-ready.",Spain,Albariño
"Toasty oak and tobacco shadings are wrapped around the dark-cherry fruit core of this 100% Tempranillo wine. The full and supple palate shows good depth of fruit, leather and spice accents. This handsome modern-style Rioja finishes long and tangy, with moderate tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This blend of Tempranillo, Merlot, Cabernet and Graciano has a sultry, earthy, almost minerally nose that's backed up by blackberry, cassis and melted brown sugar flavors. Chewy and modern, with a brawny finish that houses baked-fruit notes and a dash of chocolate.",Spain,Red Blend
"A big, ripe and earthy wine, with some baked black fruit and chocolate to the nose. Far more saturated and dense than Siruela's other Ribera wines, but amid the heft there's rich plum and roasted berry flavors and good overall balance. The finish has an herbal tinge.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A mixture of baked fruit, bacon, asphalt and leather aromas is impressive, and so is the bright, composed palate and its flavors of plum, raspberry and tobacco. It's crisp and zesty, which is probably reflective of the cool 2002 vintage, but still it's a very nice wine with depth and dexterity. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The aromas are powerful and just the slightest bit brambly. A little hot and rugged on the palate, but loaded with prime black fruit, pepper and mocha notes. It's a potent wine with meaty blackness and plenty of raw power. With 65,000 cases produced, it's not a “boutique” wine, as evidenced by the friendly price tag.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Violet and blackberry aromas are an inviting first act, while the palate is lush and fairly deep, with thick blackberry and mildly brambly flavors. Maybe it doesn't reach the penthouse, but as Ribera del Duero goes it more than makes the grade. 45,000 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dark plum aromas are sweetened and softened by oak-based coconut aromas, while the color and weight are deeper and darker than average. The palate is full, ripe, semicushioned but also acidic and vital, with black fruit, mocha and coffee notes. It finishes chocolaty, with a slight herbal note.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Not much different than the basic Sarria rosado, with maybe a touch more concentration and richness. The nose is a bit dusty, with good berry fruit notes and a whiff of cherry blossom. The palate is wet and fresh, with raspberry and plum-skin flavors. Crisp and refreshing.",Spain,Garnacha
"This pleasant wine shows clean apple, hay and mildly floral aromas. Even and round on the tongue, it has a slightly waxy feel and decent acidity. Green apple, citrus and slightly nutty flavors play on the finish, with a crisp, dry grapefruity aftertaste that lingers. Best Buy.",Spain,Viura
"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime. The palate is mostly fresh, though not as lively as it probably was nine months ago, while the flavors of 7Up and peach are refreshing. Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Spain,Albariño
"The “value” label from Condes de Albarei is always a good bet. Oceanic aromas and a spritz of lime make the nose just right, and the lively palate of lemon, melon and banana is charged up. Tight on the finish, with citrus and almond skins, and then a lasting impression of pineapple. Young and raring to go.",Spain,Albariño
"Dried cherry and spice aromas and flavors accented by peppery, meaty notes mark this joven (young wine). A blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Mazuela, it has a light, even mouthfeel. The acids are tangy, and a little prickly now, and the bright finish shows spicy elements.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A straightforward basic red, with dried cherry, oak and slightly meaty scents. The palate shows dark fruit and spice flavors, medium weight and an even texture. Finishes with decent length and tangy, spicy notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with exotic, earthy aromas and lots of black fruit, but it turns more quiet and timid with airing. The palate shows plenty of bright acidity and some heft and grab, while the flavors of dark berries and plum are accented by light herbal notes and other common Ribera accents like thyme and oregano.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Slightly dusty, spicy and cider-like on the nose, with a tight palate holding nectarine, melon and apple flavors. It's fairly exact in terms of mouthfeel, while the finish is clean and reflects well on the wine. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"This Rioja rose displays a full bouquet of rose petal, spice and the slightly meaty element that Tempranillo so often shows. No White Zinfandel, this is a fairly lean and dry wine with spicy notes, a decent match for hors d'oeuvres or light meals.",Spain,Rosé
"Meaty and composed, with an earthy nose that carries plenty of dark fruit and minty herbal accents. The palate shows clarity and density, but it's a touch gritty, hard and tannic. Flavors of cola, blackberry and burnt toast are masculine, while the finish is also kind of crusty and dark.",Spain,Garnacha
"Earthy black cherry aromas give this easygoing Rioja an honest and true nose. The palate is almost what you'd call flush, but on the other hand it's snappy and fresh, with commendable black cherry and plum flavors. With a touch of oak and mocha on the finish, it's a complete wine that should come across familiar.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Round, mossy and deep smelling, but austere in the mouth. A berry and plum flavor profile is infused with tomato and herbal notes, while the finish is long, healthy and cleansing. Very sturdy and Navarran in every sense because it blends juicy fruit with cool-climate typicity. Good but not for fans of sweet, bulky, superripe reds.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Pleasant but a little light on the nose, with candied fruit notes. Flavors of green melon, apple and citrus are standard fare and clean, while the feel is fresh and peachy. A balanced and nice wine, but not overly exciting or precise. Drink now with salad or fish.",Spain,Albariño
"Berry, earth and a touch of citrus peel make for a good bouquet, while the palate shows structure and lots of verve. The flavor profile of plum, cherry and roasted berry is solid and complete, while the finish is fresh, clean and reaches a proper finale. Call it a well-made but familiar type of old-vines Garnacha.",Spain,Garnacha
"Clean, fresh and layered up front, with peach, cherry and nectarine flavors and then apricot on the finish. The feel is good throughout, with no excess weight or sweetness. An uncomplicated, no-frills rosé, which is what Navarra and Señoría de Sarria do best.",Spain,Grenache
"Interesting blanco from the inland Galician region of Ribeira Sacra. It's Albariño with 15% Godello, and it's ready to drink now. Aromas of pulpy peach and pineapple are nice, while the apple and lime flavors are fairly gentle and flush. Finishes with adequate freshness for an '07, making it a no-qualms type of white wine.",Spain,Albariño
"Cuatro implies four grapes blended together, and the nose on this Tempranillo/Cab/Merlot/Syrah mix is a bit leathery and tight. In the mouth, it's linear and borderline lean, with plum and bramble flavors backstopped by tomato and herb notes. Juicy, intense and solid, but not overly generous or evolved. Typical Somontano red wine.",Spain,Red Blend
"A solid, earthy style of Navarran red wine, with plum, berry and meaty aromas. The palate is forward, with solid flavors of tobacco, plum, tomato and leather. More fruity than herbal, with heat, thyme, mocha and coffee on the finish. Tastes like something from the Old World. Not currently imported.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dried fruit, a touch of compost and then bold coffee and mocha aromas give the wine a decent nose, and the palate, while zesty and snappy, is endowed with pretty good raspberry, cherry and strawberry flavors. Overall it's fruity and ready to drink but fairly ordinary, and while we like the wine we can't say it's a knockout.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Gets going with earthy, lightly leathery aromas of red fruits, and that bouquet is backed by lively raspberry, plum and fresh-tomato flavors. It's not narrow, but it's hardly broad either. Finishes with a lively herbal note.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Look for the wine wrapped in banana-yellow paper, and you'll likely be surprised and pleased by its ripe, clean aromas and easygoing plum and cherry flavors. It's medium-bodied and nice on the palate, with a smooth, nonprobing finish. It's 75% Garnacha and 25% Tempranillo done well.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark, balsamic aromas blend with hints of wood, bramble and briar to give this wine rusticity, while the palate is slick and medium in weight, with black-fruit and tea-like flavors. It's a little narrow on the finish, but there's also a creamy, oak-driven vanilla flavor that softens things up. A good wine that's 70% Tempranillo and 30% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Put this Spanish rosado in the summer rotation. The nose gives you raspberry and strawberry aromas in light, airy form but avoids the candied side of the rosé spectrum. Pink grapefruit and nectarine flavors give it a fresh, clean, Mediterranean style.",Spain,Rosé
"Starts out sort of jumbled, with heavy aromas, deep fruit scents and a shot of leather or animal hide. The palate is healthy, however, with proper acidity pushing earthy plum and berry flavors. Shows good structure and ample size and mouthfeel. The blend is 75% Garnacha and 25% Graciano.",Spain,Red Blend
"Two vintages running this is good, even-flowing rosé. The color is on the red side, but the nose dials in on fluffy red-berry aromas. Plum is the primary fruit flavor, and there's body and a flame of heat and spice to the finish. A good food wine to drink now.",Spain,Rosé
"Light cherry and raspberry aromas take it to a level above neutral, while the palate is just as clean and light, with apricot, peach and strawberry flavors. With some tang and good acidity, it shows freshness and persistence.",Spain,Garnacha
"Initially it smells a bit cheesy and drawn, but with time it evolves to show plum, raspberry and tire rubber aromas. In the mouth, it's tight, fresh and a little gritty, with red-fruit flavors of cherry and raspberry. Not overly generous in terms of mouthfeel, but it does push the fruit until the final bell. More of a food wine than a solo sipper.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with marshmallow-like sweetness on the nose, but that changes to lean fruit and saline with time. The palate is solid and zesty, with standard Rioja-style plum, berry and dill flavors. It's a fresh but quiet wine, with a tight body, medium tannins and pretty good flavors. Well done but nothing unusual.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ochoa usually puts out a good rosado made from Garnacha, and this vintage keeps the winery's reputation intact. It starts with fresh peachy aromas and then comes on with light berry and peach flavors. Arguably a bit candied, but perfectly good for summer quaffing.",Spain,Garnacha
"Light aromas of melon, apple and pear are just fine, and the mildly chunky palate sporting apple-based flavors is good, as is the pineapple finish. Tasty and simple Albariño, and really not much more to say. Good for the summer into fall.",Spain,Albariño
"The best new release in the Eguren family's collection of modern Rioja wines is this small-production, 100% Tempranillo. It's a true nuevo classico with proper touches of smoked meat, herbs and sweet black fruits as well as a lush, round mouthfeel that culminates in a mile-long finish. Destined to rock your socks off. Just over 300 cases produced. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"As expected, the wine exhibits a dense black color, with mineral, burnt toast and dark fruit on the bouquet. The flavor profile offers cured meat, leather, graphite and plenty of blackberry, mocha, caramel and coffee. Beautiful modern Rioja. 4,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark as night, and dominated by meaty plum and beef jerky aromas. The palate is huge, with pure fruit, tannin and chocolate pooling at the finish. A new classic in every sense, with stellar balance and complexity. Less than 400 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The bouquet explodes with tobacco, leather, dry oak and waves of berry fruit. In the mouth, the wine sits comfortably on the tongue, with firm tannins offering structure to the bedazzling boysenberry, black cherry and cassis flavors. Long and intoxicating on the finish. It's 90% Tempranillo and 10% Garnacha and Graciano. 650 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Austere, foresty aromas of pine and juniper lead to a snappy, mildly scratchy palate that's acidic and racy. Amid the scour there's vivacious red plum and pie cherry flavors, and then a finish that's tight but controlled. An old-school wine that's fresh and linear.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is a tight, red-fruit dominated style of Granache. It's generic and crisp on the nose, with tart, linear raspberry and red cherry flavors and a dry, peppery finish. Focused and angular, with a foresty, spicy undercurrent. Drink now.",Spain,Garnacha
"Classic in color, and backed by aromatics of lavender, graphite and pure blackberry. This is not overly weighty, as the acidity keeps it pointed and pure. There's a lot of elegance and balance to this wine; a perfect example of how to blend multiple vineyards into one excellent whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Masculine and heady stuff, as leather, espresso, smoked meat, mocha and intense blackberry aromas set the stage for an intense, driven, structured palate that's full of coconut, vanilla bean, cocoa and pure plum and berry. A serious nuevo classico Rioja if there ever was one.",Spain,Tempranillo
"What a superb combination of new oak, leather, mineral, mocha and berry fruit this wine delivers. It's a giant, with a ripped palate of upfront boysenberry and then coffee and vanilla in support. All the power, precision and other attributes of modern Rioja are on display. Best in a few more years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Full and ready, this fabulous wine from Rioja Alavesa sets the bar very high for any of its Vanguardia co-runners. Gloria hits hard with bacon, tire rubber, tobacco and pastry crust aromas, but also pure dark fruit. Then it's wave after wave of boysenberry and crisped brown sugar flavors prior to a finale of heady European chocolate. Need we say more? 750 cases produced; best now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Plant-by-plant fruit selection leads to intensity, concentration and structure. Aro shows gripping tannins and juicy acidity, and overall it reeks of power and precision. At this young stage it seems like it could last forever. In reality, it should be just right in about seven years. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Only a select portion of a prized 30-year-old vineyard gives fruit to the wine named after the Eguren brothers' great grandfather. It's rich, ripe and impeccably balanced, with a brilliant dark-purple tint and an avalanche of finishing toast, chocolate and tannin. Hold until 2009. 330 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"One half of the wine is lush and opulent, the other juicy, fresh and pulsing with the essence of old-vines Rioja fruit. So for every note of molasses, burnt toast, chocolate or baked berry pie, there's a twinge of acidity, a spike of tannin and a dollop of earthy terroir. Tempranillo with 15% Graciano. 500 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly tighter and more complex than previous years, this single-  vineyard wine delivers a ton of spice and herbs on a masculine bouquet and palate. Well-blended acids and tannins allow for it to be drunk now or over the next five to eight years. About 4,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is yet another magnetic example from the Eguren stable that includes El Puntido, San Vicente, Finca El Bosque and the many Sierra Cantabria wines. It's a racy, red-fruit dominated Tempranillo with raspberry, plum and cassis flavors accented by firm, almost blazing acidity. It's definitely tighter and more compact than the more generous, richer 2005 La Nieta. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Herbal aromas come with bell pepper and berry fruit notes, while the palate is solid in terms of feel but shows classic Navarran flavors of jalapeño and green pepper. Good texture and mouthfeel, but probably too green for a lot of people. Tempranillo with Merlot and Cabernet is the blend.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A very pretty middle-aged wine that has at least another decade in it. At this point in time, the nose is still showing a lot of black-fruit aromas, while the palate is chewy, meaty and rich as it spreads out with ripe flavors mixed with touches of mushroom, truffle and vanilla. A fine Gran Reserva with equal bits of tradition and modernity showing through.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Beautiful in color as it blends hues of purple and red. The nose is endowed with leather, herbs and cherry, while the full palate houses a delicious range of fruit and wood flavors along with fine tannins and length. It's like a new-school classic with a traditional name and packaging. 1,250 cases made. Good now thru 2016. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose. This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character. Drink now through 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Right away this shows the requisite signs of excellence. The meaty, earthy, leathery, full-fruit nose is just right, and the palate is elevated in how it is infused with pure blackberry and plum as well as chocolate and fine herbs. Finishes with class and kick. Best from 2008–2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Like all young Sierra Cantabria wines made from old vines, this has a purple color that's supported by aromas of coffee, mocha and black fruits. It's half aged in American oak (the other half is French), and it's much more tannic, acidic and structured than the fleshy 2003. A wine with pure flavors and a dynamic structure. Just under 1,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Benjamin Romeo makes nothing but big, idiosyncratic wines. And some are big hits while others may not be your thing. This modern, round, polished blend is creamy and smooth but also loaded with almond, pear, citrus and toast flavors. Certainly there's a strong wood element, but it handles it with aplomb and oozes class. Drink as soon as possible. It won't age much past 2007. Only 25 cases made.",Spain,White Blend
"Robust and sexy, with smoke, leather and pure berry and plum aromas that make for a sensational bouquet. The palate is up to the precedent set by the nose, as the cherry and cola flavors are outright lovely. For what you get, this is almost a value. It shows us what that Muga can do in a great vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Stylish and serious, with polished, fancy oak sitting like royalty atop dark   fruit that is almost pruney. The palate hits with a solid smack of blackberry, while a secondary layer delivers chocolate, mocha and spice. Not quite at the level of the classic 2001 but still excellent.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet and sour aromas amount to a prickly bouquet, while the palate has some flesh as well as freshness. Nectarine and spiced apple flavors are solid but pithy, and overall the wine is good but lacks concentration. Good for everyday quaffing.",Spain,Rosé
"The opening of earth, berry and leather aromas is solid enough, yet the palate is quite acidic, yielding semitart but exact flavors of pie cherry and plum. The finish is tight, with light oak touches. But overall it's on the angular side, with a bit of the razor's edge in terms of acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Cherry and dried cranberry aromas along with the magenta color give this wine a “red” personality, which is confirmed by the crisp red-fruit flavor profile. Fairly light in weight, but juicy and fresh, with cleansing acidity and some sharpness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"It has taken this bodega a few years to get it right, but in 2004 this blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet is dark and rocking. The nose offers that modern but increasingly familiar blast of bacon, baked fruit pastry and leather, and the palate works its magic with black plum and smoked game flavors. If it were just a touch longer and richer toward the finish it might rank as a nuevo classico.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Initial aromas are squarely in the bell pepper/jalapeño mode, and later moss and earth enter the picture. The palate is basic, a bit acidic, and saucy, with herbal red-fruit flavors and a finish of tomato and basil. Struggles a little, but solid in a “country” sort of way. The blend is Tempranillo, Garnacha, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Tan in color and smelling fairly oxidized. Aromas of peach pits and blanched almond lack freshness, while the palate veers more toward applesauce than fresh fruit. There's some life left but not enough to make it a recommended wine. Tastes, feels and smells sort of jumbled.",Spain,Albariño
"Chunky spiced apple and saline aromas get the wine off on so-so footing, and the apple and grapefruit flavors come with weight. Citrus takes over on the finish, but it's kind of pithy. Doesn't seem as fresh as it should be for a brand new '08.",Spain,Albariño
"With its spice and fig aromas, this registers as a rich, mature Rioja reserva. The palate runs toward sweet plums and blackberry, while the finish is mildly toasty and full, with coffee as the lasting flavor. This has many good qualities, not the least of which is balance and a touch of citrus peel. Best now–2010. 525 cases produced.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A sweet, ripe, jammy style for Roda I, with smooth tannins, corpulence and more than adequate minerality and power. This is not a flabby wine despite the heat of the vintage, and the lush cassis, blackberry and mocha notes come together on the back palate and finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Thick, brooding and aromatically mature, this delivers heft, grab and balance. It has developed black-fruit flavors followed by a cushioned, soft finish. Drink now and over the next several years as the 2001 gets better and the promising but not yet released 2004 begins to settle. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"You're going to like this masculine, well-oaked blend of 80% Tempranillo with 10% each Graciano and Garnacha. It's got modern touches but a lot of tradition as well. The wine is rich and round, with tobacco, coffee, chocolate and earth creating depth and character. With fine mouthfeel and a solid finish, you can drink now or hold a few more years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This seems eminently ageworthy; it has the strong foundation and pulsing acidity required of a true cellar dweller. The raspberry and plum fruit have a beam of acidity and the tannins are not shy. Shows all the hallmarks of a fine modern Rioja: power, purity and balance. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A dense wine from the start, and each subsequent whiff of the oaky but vital nose is convincing. The palate here is exemplary, especially for an '02; there's dark berry and plum flavors backed by notes of black licorice and pepper. An exceedingly nice wine with a textbook mix of tannins, flesh and acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Early tobacco and mint aromas quickly yield to mossy black fruit, and in the mouth it's fresh and zesty, with mild green-pepper infused plum and cassis flavors. Quite crisp and lean, with herbal influences showing up at all points. Classic Navarran red wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With raisiny, damp aromas and a flat body, we can only label this Marqués de Murrieta high-ender a miss. While not a disaster, you'd expect more from something labeled Gran Reserva Especial, but instead it fails to capture the essence of Rioja and shows heavy cola, blackberry and truffle flavors as well as deep, dull tannins. Overripe to begin with?",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Broad-shouldered and muscled-up, this hearty wine seems more youthful than it is. The nose is spicy and full of lively berry aromas, while the palate is laced with red cherry, raspberry and vanilla. It's a classic gran reserva with dried qualities and spice. It's right on the money.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bramble, cherry cola and snappy red berry aromas announce this as a secure, snappy wine. The flavor profile is round, genial and nicely balanced between plum and berry and vanilla/mocha notes. Like most Sierra Cantabria reds, this touches all the bases and should elicit a smile of satisfaction.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light cherry and mild sulfuric aromas are standard fare for this class of wine, while the palate is snappy and fresh, with sweet-and-sour cherry and strawberry flavors. Finishes a little gritty and candied, but pleasant enough overall.",Spain,Red Blend
"Varietal Graciano is something we frequently see, and very rarely does it bowl us over. This wine has jumpy cherry and lemon peel aromas, and the flavors are tight, a touch sour and run toward cherry and red plum. Fruity for certain, but lacking in charm and mouthfeel.",Spain,Graciano
"Round, big and medicinal, with clumsy, roasted berry fruit aromas. The palate isn't overly charming, and the flavors of tomato paste, cranberry and herbal red fruit are curious. Finishes cleansing and zesty, but with another wave of tomato-based flavors. Shows a lot of cool-climate, mountain influence.",Spain,Red Blend
"Baked berry and raisin aromas raise questions about the wine's overall balance, while the plate is sharp and acidic yet tastes of raisin, prune and dried apricots. Rather grabby on the finish. Think slam dancing when approaching this Tempranillo-Garnacha blend.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Is it (MS) or the wine? This vintage of Cáceres rosé seems o.k., but nothing more than a splash across the palate. Cotton candy aromas and grapefruit and orange flavors are what they are. Not bad so long as it's fresh, but it's hard to locate much charm or individuality.",Spain,Rosé
"Dark mineral, toasted French oak and black fruit carry the nose. This is a sturdy, nicely made high-end Rioja, but due to the heat of the year its range of flavors is narrow as it settles on baked plum and molasses. Medium long on the finish, with a lasting taste of chocolate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Salinic, eggy and simply not that fresh. Maybe it's the wine or maybe it's past its prime, but for Albariño it's not showing much. The palate is soft and flat, with fleshy flavors of muddled apple. And the wine just splats against your palate without delivering any grace or cut.",Spain,Albariño
"Stylish and alluring nose; quite sexy. The malolactic fermentation took place in barrel, so the wine has mouthfeel and richness. Yet it's a juicy, friendly, fruit-forward style of Tempranillo, one that finishes with mocha and wood-driven spice notes. 20,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy and fully ripe, with classic Rioja aromas of sweet leather, herbs and a touch of raisin. But once you get it onto the palate you'll be impressed with the roundness of the body and the depth of the cola, cherry and plum flavors. Finishes with cocoa, buttered toast and width. Drink now through 2008.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A tough wine to enjoy. The nose has a cheesy top layer, while the base aromas are of bell pepper and lettuce. It's very tangy and juicy in the mouth, with searing red-cherry flavors and green accents. Snappy and whispy to the max.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Blackberry and cola are the prime aromas that comprise the alluring bouquet. And as you'd expect, there's also leather and spicy wood thrown in. In the mouth, it's an intense ride of rich black cherry and plum. For now it's a little closed on the finish; will likely be better in three years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Seductive and classy aromas of sandalwood, cola, spice, licorice and leather amount to pretty much everything you could ask for. Ripe and complex in terms of its earth and tree-fruit flavors. Finishes svelte and sturdy, but with ample vanilla, toffee and tobacco nuances. Classic gran reserva. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Top-notch manzanilla, plain and simple. What's not plain and simple is the fact that this is so pure and smooth that it dances across your palate. From the vanilla and almond on the nose to the pastry and mushroom on the palate to the creamed butter on the finish, this is as good as it gets in this class.",Spain,Sherry
"The previous two years we did not find this wine to be worthy of a rating. This time, we rate it but note that it's an almost-red wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon. It's sweet smelling, with fiery plum-skin flavors that evaporate along with the mouthfeel. Leaves a burn patch on the finish. Particular to the max.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"For a good price you get a lot of white wine here. Muga barrel ferments this Viura, so there's popcorn and richness to the nose, but it's not overwhelming. And in the mouth, the lemon, orange and tangerine flavors are flat-out lovely. Pour a glass of this with your next platter of sizzling garlic shrimp and you'll be in heaven.",Spain,Viura
"Good color and intriguing aromas of baked fruit, tobacco and mint indicate that you're getting some modern-styled ripeness along with traditional Rioja earth, spice and old man's library. The palate is juicy and mildy fruity, while the finish pushes chocolate, vanilla, baking spice and tannins. Drinkable now but will age for another five years without a problem.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ysios is one of the most visually pleasing wineries you'll see. It was designed by Santiago Calatrava and it's the town of Laguardia's modern stamp. But until now the wines were just average. This one, however, is far better than that, with pure dried cherry and raspberry flavors bolstered by spicy oak, vanilla and perfect acidity. Drink now–2009. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smooth berries and plenty of dark licorice carry the seductive bouquet. And seeing that this is Remelluri's signature high-priced red, you should expect the fine berry, plum and chocolate flavors that rest comfortably on the palate. But like many '02s, the wine has a hard mouthfeel and pronounced acidity, so it doesn't quite trigger all the pleasure points that it might in a better vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bramble bush, graphite, leather and medium-depth fruit are the opening notes on this qualm-free, fairly muscular Rioja. Dark cherry and raspberry flavors run the palate, and they are followed by a warm, milk chocolate-tinged finish. Very nice for a 2002.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A real surprise! Who in their right mind could expect so much quality from a Cab Franc-Tempranillo blend from Penedès? But try it and we guarantee you're going to like it. The nose is meaty, ripe and round, while the palate features pure core fruit backed by chocolaty warmth. With kick as well as subtlety, this is a bargain hunter's dream. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Still young and jumpy, but the ripeness and pedigree of this Penedès bruiser is beyond reproach. It's big, bold and deep as a mountain lake, with black plum, bullion and a pile of blackberry on the palate. Tons of extract and tannins make this inky, saturated heavyweight a wine to ponder. For fans of forward, beefy reds. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Spain,Red Blend
"Black cherry and toasty oak aromas greet you, followed by racy raspberry flavors. There's a lot of acid, but there's also ample berry flesh and texture to handle it. Shows good quality overall but also some of 2002's lean character. Drink now with food and it won't be any trouble.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Alluring cherry and berry aromas show a touch of candied sweetness, yet overall the bouquet is magnetically attractive. And the palate is deep and spicy, with tons of red fruit accented by toast and chocolate. And as far as complexity notes go, there's rose petal, lavender and leather. Eminently drinkable; excellent quality to price ratio. Imported by Allied Domecq Wines USA.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A touch of early aromatic raisin gives way to spice, tobacco, tomato and cherry, while the palate is ripe and rich, with flavors of raspberry syrup and prune. Very deep and smooth, with just enough toasty oak to keep things well framed. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Red Blend
"A little bit leafy and light, but that's traditional Rioja for you. The color is a mix of orange and red, while the palate of snappy red fruits is beginning to slip toward peach and nectarine. If you like a leaner, racier style of wine, then drink this now. It's probably at its peak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite yellow, with toffee, peanuts and light fruit aromas. Big and round in the mouth, with dried apple, almond and white pepper flavors. Full and long late, with tons of texture and a strong mushroom accent. Powerful, so you'd better be a fino fan if you're going to tackle this one.",Spain,Sherry
"Fans of big, blocky reds that offer punch, extract and tannins should jump on this now, and then watch it age nicely for the next four or five years. That's the type of meaty, tannic, fruit-infused Tempranillo this is. It's always going to be short and stocky, but still it will round into shape as it matures.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Early leather and animal aromas soon yield to brighter fruit scents, and that's followed up by a palate detailed by cherry and plum flavors. This nice, comfortable wine offers freshness and texture; it's a very good crianza that nails the relationship between fruit and oak.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A heavier, more elevated style, but still well-priced relative to the competition. Expect lusty toast and berry aromas along with a round but juicy palate that delivers chewy berry and plum flavors and some “grasa,” which means fat in Spanish. A cut above most wines in this price range.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rock solid, with spice, leather and piercing oak on the nose. Snappy and upright on the palate, with tons of berry fruit and nice smoky shadings. Balanced and nuanced, with vanilla, licorice, toast and spice on the finish. A winner. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Red Blend
"Massive yet proportional, with olive, rubber and ripe black fruit on the manly bouquet. The palate is ponderous but tasty, with a huge dose of syrupy berry and black-plum flavors. Ripe as all get out, with firm tannins. To call it a powerhouse would be taking things lightly. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Bouquet is nice and smooth, with an earthy warmth surrounding scents of purple flowers and crushed berries. The palate is lively and acidic, with semisweet red-fruit flavors that are more generic. No reticence here; the wine is racy to the end as it finishes with oak and vanilla.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Alert and snappy on the nose, with no “hot” or stewy characteristics from the steamy year. Raspberry and cassis flavors are supported by tight, crisp oak, while the finish offers mineral, coffee and cherry essence. A solid wine from a hellishly warm vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stout and generally quite pure, with aromas of leather and berries that thicken and gather density with airing. The palate is your standard new-age blend of dark cherry and raspberry, while the finish is oaky, warm and spicy. Very nice, if a touch jammy and simple.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Plenty of dusty, spicy aromas run the nose, almost to the exclusion of ripe fruit. But once it opens the wine displays savory flavors as well as some pure dark berry. On the finish, it's a touch lean and crisp, but overall this is a balanced Rioja reserva with spunk.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little leafy, a little spicy and a little bit of a throwback to the days when Rioja wasn't taken so seriously. This has light cinnamon oak shadings followed by cola, tobacco and sweet berry flavors. Somewhat acidic and sheer, so better with food; drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A juicy, prickly wine with pungent red-fruit aromas backed by tangy cherry, raspberry and currant flavors. It's firm and tight, entirely reflective of the cool vintage, and the bet here is that it's unlikely to ever lose that inherent toughness. Needs food to absorb the crispness. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Almost orange in color but fairly lively on the nose, where cherry, vanilla, leather and licorice come together. Firm and acidic at its center, with surrounding tobacco, cherry and citrus flavors. Shows some toast and root beer on the finish. Very solid stuff from a good vintage. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Beautifully composed, with power and just as much precision and pizzazz. The nose offers lightly baked berry fruit notes, leather and spice, while the palate is loaded with tobacco, exotic spices and the finest natural berry flavors Spain has to offer. Smooth, elegant, finessed and potent, with integrated tannins and bold acidity that will keep it going for at least a decade. Drink from 2012 through 2018.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Tilts a bit toward the ripe side, with sweet, mature aromas of blueberry, raisin and vanilla. It's fleshy and soft in terms of feel, with earthy, warm flavors of fig, berry and molasses. Drink now for its traditional integrity and tobacco-like qualities; it's not improving.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little tight and reticent, but airing reveals aromas of raisin, marzipan and earth. The palate is measurably peppier, with lean but healthy red-fruit flavors stepping up and demanding to be noticed. As for feel, expect grabby tannins and shortness. Probably at its best now but will hold steady for at least five more years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Spicy and exotic, with tight fruit and plenty of tannin in the mouth. There's a lot of juicy blackberry flavors along with full-force acids and verve. Tight as a drum, with some rough edges that should mellow over the next year or so. A wine to watch from a region that's showing its stuff. Imported by Bon Vivant Imports.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Quite ripe, with a touch of stewiness that settles with time and morphs into a pool of ripe cherries, berries and raisins. More soft than hard, with easygoing tannins and a meaty, chunky finish laced with licorice and cured meat. Dense and chewy. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Red Blend
"Lots of bacon, leather and earth coat the nose of this vanguard-style Rioja, but unlike the spectacular 2001, the '02 is not nearly as deep and ethereal. Blame the cool, wet vintage and take solace in the fact that it's still a rich, almost syrupy red with integrated tannins and lushness. What's missing is the wine's patented layering and complexity. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Talk about magnetic aromas of bacon, tobacco and bold black fruit, and then comes an oak-rich palate full of coconut, butter, chocolate and exotic berry flavor. Chocolate truffle and pastry work the finish, and overall this is a mile-deep beauty to drink from 2011 through 2017.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Make room in the cellar for this heavyweight! Talk about a monster wine; but there's also finesse, character and style to it. Alabaster is the top wine from the Eguren family's new Toro winery, and it's big, tannic and loaded with spice, molasses and syrupy black fruit flavors. Rich, long and fierce on the finish, with tannins and heat to resolve. Best from 2012 through 2020.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Plenty of red berry and jam greet you on the nose, and beyond that there's sweet barrel notes and a little wood smoke. It's smart and snappy on the palate, but not all that long or complex. Finishing notes of tobacco add interest. Tasty and ready to go now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A good effort in a tough year, and frankly we're happy that Muga decided to make a reserva in 2002. The wine shows lean aromas of dried red fruit, tomato leaf and dill. In fact, dill is a recurring theme from front to back. And along the way there's acids, red cherries, plums and currants. Good but leaner than a normal Muga effort.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Early aromas of leather, rubber and char sort of shadow the fruit component. But in the mouth there's ample blackberry, cherry and pepper, all of which bring the wine into form. In terms of mouthfeel, it's good. And on the finish it's got some of that espresso bitterness that sings of toasted barrels.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Healthy in look, with tobacco, dried spices and pure wood notes on the nose. The palate is drizzled with plum and berry flavors, but there's also ample tobacco and tomato-leaf accents. Overall this aging Rioja is healthy and has enough of the nuances and subtleties to make the grade.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Mature but not even close to expiring, with cola, root beer, tree bark and leather on the bouquet. Fairly acidic, which is why it has so much verve at 10+ years. Flavors of dried cherry, raspberry and citrus peel are classic in their attack. Very good in an Old World way. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cherry, earth and leather are nice opening notes, while some charred oak adds masculinity and depth. Almost syrupy in the mouth, with plenty of black cherry and chocolate to satisfy those with a sweet tooth. Exhibits nice core qualities. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Red Blend
"Clean, nutty and smooth, if a touch neutral on the nose. The palate pushes more nuts and distant white fruits, followed by a finish of fleur de sel and cashew butter. Slightly heavy but that's the style; like its sister manzanilla, this wine is very consistent year to year.",Spain,Sherry
"Quite international in style, a direct reflection of the Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah components that comprise the wine. That said, this is probably the best wine Martinez Bujanda has made at its La Mancha winery; it's plump and ripe, with nice cherry and plum flavors. It's medium in weight and length, and juicy. Likable as can be. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Red Blend
"A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive. The palate is ripe, rich and just forward enough, with blackberry, wild berry, coffee and fudge flavors. Settles nicely on the finish, and overall this wine shows almost all of what's good about modern Ribera del Duero wines. 250 cases made; drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Outstanding Sherry with complexity, richness and character. The nose has a salinic zest to it, making it no wallflower, and of course there's raisin and prune. The palate is formed, sculpted and balanced, with peanut M&M;'s candy, roasted fruit, chocolate ice cream and more. A beauty with power and poise.",Spain,Sherry
"This is the tier-two wine from the Egurens' new Toro project, and it's stellar. Intense aromas of black fruit, char and mint start it out, and next up come cola, roasted black fruit, clove and cured-meat flavors. Oak is forward now, but it should settle in a year or so. A dynamite Toro to drink from 2011 through 2018.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A wonderfully balanced and giving wine with sweet raisin and prune aromas and an overall richness akin to crude oil. Flavors of baked black plum, brown sugar and molasses are both juicy and rich, and then toffee and mocha take over on the finish. Sweet and thick for sure, but with discernible fruit and vitality.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Smooth up front, with a light veil of oak sitting on top of black fruit. In the mouth, flavors of raspberry and plum satisfy in a juicy, medium-depth sort of way, while the finish is cushioned by chocolate and vanilla notes. A crianza that gets it right.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Color and size are readily apparent but gaps appear between the layers. For starters, the nose doesn't have the purity and density that it could; and the palate also shows some weakness where structure and quality of fruit meet. Otherwise, it's a ripe and modern red wine with some lushness and depth.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Round, clean and a touch leathery, but not penetrating or dense. For a nice, smooth red wine with some plum and cinnamon spice, look no further. This crianza is easygoing, lightly oaked and good throughout.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Full and ripe, with tobacco and a certain earthy nuttiness to the nose. Raspberry and plum are the leading flavors, while the mouthfeel is both textured as well as juicy. Full in the middle, with a likable personality. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Spicy and saucy on the nose, with some leather and cherry mixed in. Shows attractive cherry and tobacco flavors, and they are supported by ripe, pure tannins. This is a tight, ripe wine that is drinkable now and should hold for another couple of years at the very least. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Red Blend
"Gets off the blocks with Middle Eastern spice notes of cumin and curry, but later on open-cut wood and vanilla take over. Bold cherry, blackberry and black olive flavors are solid, while the mouthfeel is tannic and rowdy. Possibly too grabby for some, but if you like Tempranillo taken to the extreme this might be your ticket. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big and toasty, with graphite, rubber and leather accenting pure black-fruit aromas. This is one ripe, tannic Rioja, but it's pure and the berry flavors sing a nice song. Solid on the finish, with length and feel. Shows the right stuff without blowing you away. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice, brawny and integrated, with sexy aromas of wild berry, dark plum, leather and earth. The palate has the right weight and tannic grab, while the flavors of black fruit, fine herbs, cola and coffee are measured yet generous. Finishes with driving chocolate and vanilla flavors. Drink now through 2016.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Teso la Monja is the new Toro winery from the Eguren family of Rioja fame (former owners of Numanthia-Termes in Toro), and it's proof that no beat has been missed since they sold out to Moët Hennessy. Expect dark, intense black fruit aromas and flavors mixed with heat, tannin, cola and spice. Some oak creeps out on the finish, but overall this is a lovely, bullish Toro. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A nominally sweet red-candy note helps define the upbeat nose, and it all makes sense once you know that there's 20% Garnacha in the wine along with 75% Tempranillo and Mazuelo. With airing you get nice pie cherry and raspberry flavors, while the mouthfeel is juicy and correct. A good wine for pizza or hamburgers. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ready as it will ever be, this mildly baked red starts with minty aromas and chocolate. The palate is saturated and full of fruit, but the feel is a touch thin given the color and the lightly cooked aromas. Drink now with food and it will satisfy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rich and pruney, with bold, reduced black fruit aromas along with chocolate and spice. Compact and delicious in the mouth, with caramel, black coffee and other yummy, unctuous flavors. So thick it pours like motor oil, thus feel free to drink it like a wine or pour it on vanilla ice cream as you might a syrup.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"This is an easy, sweeter style of Viura that emits aromas of peaches and pears. The palate is lively enough but not exactly zesty, and the flavors run toward pink grapefruit and other citrus fruits; but think sweet, nice fruits—not sour ones. Has all the hallmarks of a good aperitif wine.",Spain,White Blend
"Racy on the nose, with tea, pepper and pine scents along with basic red-fruit aromas. The palate is zingy and fairly trim, with strawberry and raspberry flavors. Finishes fresh and snappy, with a shot of tartness. Drink now. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Deep purple in color, with roasted, rubbery aromas of wild blackberry. Thick, lush and rich in the mouth, with mellow tannins (for a Priorat wine) and big, broad flavors of plum, blackberry and herbs. Smooth on the finish, with black tea notes and leftover oak. Has a lot going for it; drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"A genuinely attractive, well-made old vines red with earthy, minerally aromas along with violet petal and blackberry. The palate has a fine feel to it, depth and complexity, while flavors of dry berry and baking spices work wonders. Dry, pure and long on the finish, and really quite excellent for a vino de tierra. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A throwback Rioja that sports tobacco, mulch and some true Old-World aromas that make you question the wine's health. But airing breathes life and tilts it toward dried cherries. Finally you discover core power hammered home by hard tannins, sharp acidity and an odd nuttiness. Not a wine for all tastes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"As always, this gracious white wine made from the Viura grape delivers the goods. In this case, it's pineapple and pear aromas in front of pleasant apple and fresh celery flavors. There's even some honeyed apple to the finish. Light, liquidy and never bad when served properly chilled.",Spain,Viura
"For unafflicted plum and berry character, this young, fresh Rioja has the goods. The sweet berry and cherry palate is at peak drinking condition, and the finish runs longer than expected courtesy of a beam of bright acidity. A wine with Zinfandel-like charm. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on. Impressive depth of flavor, nice overall balance and a mix of complexity and flat-out richness make this PX a winner.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Round, stylish and wholesome on the nose, with wild berry, smoke, spice and not too much obvious oak. The palate is racy and forward, but also offers subtleties including dry fruit, spice, fresh tomato and wild herbs such as thyme and sage. Long and warm on the finish, with vanilla. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Another impressive Oloroso from Gonzalez Byass. This is a sweet, dark, brooding Sherry with prune and other sweet fruit aromas. The palate is rich but has good flow, while dark flavors of dulce de leche and burnt brown sugar are wonderful. Sweet but balanced by mild coffee-like bitterness on the finish.",Spain,Sherry
"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fine aromas that announce balance and completeness draw you in, and right away you will like the cherry, red currant and cassis flavors. But as that fruit sits and the acidity builds, the wine goes racy initially and then almost haywire. By the end it almost falls off toward sour. Best right out of the bottle, and with food.",Spain,Tempranillo
"As per usual, this wine carries a leafiness and peppery quality that runs ahead of its fruit quotient. That doesn't mean it's a poor wine; but it emphasizes dry oak and saucy flavors as opposed to richness and ripeness. Best for Rioja traditionalists and those who might drink it with robust foods.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of cherry sucking candy, sangria and citrus peel are easy and clean but not what you'd call sophisticated. The palate is forward and basic, with tangy cherry and plum skin flavors. It thickens a bit on the finish but always has a racy personality. Better with food due to grabby tannins and acids.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Seems like Solabal let its reserva-level grapes get a little too soft before picking. The wine has color and potential, but the nose is a little flat and syrupy. The palate delivers ripe dark fruit flavors but also a touch of medicinality. Balance can be fleeting and this wine doesn't have it all the way.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A smooth and coaxing Sherry with almond and dried fruit aromas that lead perfectly to toffee and almond flavors. There's more dryness than fruit here, with peanut brittle accents and then a long, smoky finish that doesn't lose focus. Graceful Oloroso, with a nice individual character.",Spain,Sherry
"This is nothing more than a few barrels of wine bottled by Hughes, a so-called “global vintner.” And like its Lot 128 brother, it is really good juice. Inky and floral, with blueberry and wild raspberry flavors. It's smooth, fresh, bold and finishes with mint and chocolate. Shows the positives of Campo de Borja's Garnacha.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast. The wine is ripe and balanced, with hickory flavors adding a barbecued angle to the steady palate. Firm, structured and tasting of clove and woodspice on the finish. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A standard but solid Tempranillo is what you're looking at. The nose pushes red fruit and some American oak aromas like pickle and dill. The feel is fresh and young, but also a little fleshy and substantive. Finishes friendly and smooth.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Perfectly nice, but ultimately basic in its approach. The nose is initally dry and woodsy, with plenty of balsam. Later on, the palate reveals a previously unseen black cherry element, while the finish is crisp and lean. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
The kick and acidic foundation of this crianza work in its favor. They balance some of the heavier elements and emphasize the berry core and also the finish. Is it narrow and limited? Yes. But it fits the traditional mold and doesn't disappoint.,Spain,Tempranillo
"Spicy and reedy in an old-fashioned way. This wine represents traditional Riojano winemaking: it's tight, acidic and endowed with racy rhubarb, raspberry and dill flavors. Pretty full and big on the palate, with touches of green herb and spice on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A fuller, more minty and deep Garnacha than Hughes' Lot 129. This has standup, standout aromas followed by deep berry fruit flavors. It has plenty of body but keeps its balance, and the finish is thick and strong. A little rugged but really good by regional standards.",Spain,Garnacha
"A touch horsey at first, but with time it settles on saddle leather and earthy fruit. The palate is chunky and beefy, with some funk, chocolate and herbal black fruit. Not super spunky and lively, but dense as a brick and interesting. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ripe and attractive, with deep red fruit aromas. The palate is intense and thorough, with solid tannins supporting ripe, natural flavors of baked berries, particularly blackberry and dark plum. Subtle and smooth on the finish, with length. The blend is 50% Garnacha and 25% each Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"A potent, concentrated sort of wine with minerally, crusty aromas, smoked meat and black fruit. The palate is deep and ripe, with pure, tasty, sweet flavors of mildly baked blackberry. Generous late, with mocha and toast on the finish. Best now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bold, dark and handsome, albeit a touch herbal and earthy on the nose. The palate is thick and statuesque, with herbal, rooty berry fruit, a spot of raisin, and cracked black pepper. Chewy, deep and ultimately dry on the finish. Drinkable now; best in another couple of years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"CUNE is a throwback bodega whose wines won't appeal to followers of the new wave. And since I consider myself a backer of the modern style, I found this wine too obtuse, funky and borderline dirty to rate higher. It's full of mossy, stewy flavors and the feel is heavy. Traditionalist, however, may find it worthy of greater praise.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This wine is not up there with the bodega's top bottlings. It's rather sweet and soft, with mildly green and minty aromas. In the mouth, there's size and power but also a strong medicinal overtone that dampens the fiesta. In the end it's big and fruity but there's no sense of path or purpose.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lemon-lime and ginger ale are the opening aromas, while the palate carries green melon and passion fruit flavors. Not terribly intense or complex, with a cider-like spritz to the mouthfeel and finish.",Spain,Viura
"Vanilla, raisin and carob aromas announce a level of heft and overripeneness that is never lost or compensated for. It's a jammy, soft, well-aged specimen that doesn't have much life or kick. It does offer ripe, sweet berry flavors, however, and some molasses.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Raisin, licorice and sawdust are the primary aromas, while the palate runs dry and slightly overdone with oak. It's a decent wine that's neither funky nor faulty; but it is dried out and lean, with apple skin and hard-spice flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"An easygoing but nicely made Rioja that delivers purity, good fruit, body and feel. The nose is all cherry and berry, and it's a clear step up from your everyday red wine. The palate is medium bodied, with tasty, spicy flavors of cherry and raspberry. Lasting on the finish, with proper texture throughout.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Oak, cherry and raisin make for a warm bouquet, and there's initial weight to the palate. But then grabby tannins and cutting acidity take over, pushing the fruit toward zesty, even thin. A light and ready style, for certain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"When in doubt, you can always trust Dry Sack. As always, this is a powerful, rich Sherry with burnt sugar and heavily toasted coffee and caramel flavors. It's no softie courtesy of heat and acidity, and at all points it mixes its sweet side with tough, roasted intensity. Great for cigar smokers.",Spain,Sherry
"Excellent Ribera crianza here. It has a smooth, appealing bouquet of candied berry fruit, which is followed by a rich palate of cassis, black cherry, prune, chocolate and coffee. For the price point this is right on the money; it's ripe but also really good and ready to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Red cherry, cough drop and a touch of mushroom work the nose, while in the mouth it's crisp and pointed, with light red fruit and citrus-influenced flavors. A lean, lithe wine very much in the pie cherry realm.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This semisweet white can come across likable or awful, depending on your mood and the shape of the bottle you're drinking. The sample we tried for this review was in perfect shape, and it showed tropical fruit and pineapple aromas in front of sugary mango and melon flavors.",Spain,White Blend
"Roasted and woodsy on the nose, with a base scent of raisins. The palate pushes tight cherry flavors and a little citrus, while the feel is uncomplicated and light.",Spain,Red Blend
"Right from the start you know this wine is challenged. The nose is lean and green, with hints of tea and citrus peel. In the mouth, it's snappy and traditional, meaning there's American oak dill notes brushing up against rhubarb and red cherry. Proponents will cite its “classic” character while others will call it thin and not very rewarding.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Spearmint and untamed wild berry aromas start it down a slope that ends with a palate that's hot and heavy with fruit but devoid of balance and touch. There's a lot of this and that, namely vanilla and oak. But overall the wine just gets it together.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Cheerful but basic raspberry aromas and flavors is what this young Rioja is about. It feels a little bulky at first, and then acids swell up to cut it short. Almost snappy in the late innings.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"This wine is not typical of Allende. It suffered from the heat of 2003 and thus it's overtly aromatic in a prune-like way and out of balance on the palate. If it weren't for the unusual but intriguing molasses aromas and the occasional blast of quality berry fruit, we'd dismiss it outright. Better to wait for the 2004.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An attempt at high-end Tempranillo that comes across rough and tough and not too friendly. The nose is rubbery and dark, while the palate is big and generic, with chocolate on the back end. But where this wine gets you is in feel: it's a tannic monster.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with rooty, mature aromas of tobacco, baked berry and raisin, while the palate is full and roasted, with sweet baked-plum and brown sugar flavors. Mature and ready to go, with head-to-toe sweetness and molasses accents. Not a hard, tannic wine. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stewed fruit aromas with some baked beans on the side just isn't alluring, and the lean, raw, acidic palate that some might describe as traditional isn't clicking in my book. Saving graces include milk chocolate on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An earthy style with pickle barrel and leather on the nose. Dark berry flavors are muddled, and there's an odd twinge of citrus to the flavor profile. Never really gets it going and seems murky. Two samples tasted.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A dry, oily, piquant Oloroso that's more peanutty than almondy. The palate is racy due to no shortage of acidity, and the flavor profile is led by a salty, briney almond and leather character. Sheer and serious, with not a sugar cube in sight.",Spain,Palomino
"A bit heavy and raisiny, but with that said there's no denying the wine's richness and ripeness. Lush and dense in the mouth, with cocoa, roasted fruit and a mild syrupy lean to the flavor profile. Sweet but a little short on the finish, and condensed. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Never let the price tag dictate perceived quality; you may be disappointed. This tart, choppy, clumsily extracted Tempranillo is a case in point. Where's the balance and mouthfeel? This is why we blind-taste; save your $350.",Spain,Tempranillo
"We are big fans of most Sierra Cantabria wines, but this fading, overoaked white Rioja is more or less a dud. It's weighed down by heavy, unintegrated wood notes and the finish is like chewing an oak branch. It's hard to see the point. 250 cases made.",Spain,White Blend
". Stand up and take note: this is great wine from Priorat. And that's regardless of whether it is typically Priorato in style. It trades textbook minerality for lushness, and the fruit is star quality. In the mouth, there's an explosion of grape matter that leaves coffee, chocolate, peanut brittle and vanilla. Almost drinkable right now but best from 2009.",Spain,Red Blend
"Earthy and crusty at first, with smoked meat, black fruit and dryness to the nose. The palate is well formed and proper, with dry raspberry and mild chocolate flavors. Finishes peppery and solid, with the slightest herbal note. Very nice wine to drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A super sweet, potent brew that takes no prisoners as it hits with powerful toffee, caramel and alcohol aromas. Good in the mouth because it's not gritty, but very sweet on the palate, with honey, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors. If sweet is your thing, then add a point or two to our score.",Spain,Sherry
"Having really liked this wine a couple of years ago, this vintage seems comparatively fierce and aggressive, which isn't to say it isn't hugely flavorful and aromatic. On the down side, it's residue-heavy and tannic, with full extraction and tannic berry fruit. Tough as nails; maybe it just needs a couple of years to settle.",Spain,Mencía
"Opens with rich aromas of raisin, licorice, black plum and molasses that put it on the cusp of overripe. The palate is rich and gritty, with deep berry and molasses flavors. Generous for sure, but also slightly baked and sweet. Tastes like a warm-climate, warm-vintage wine. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Raspberry and plum aromas carry a mild floral, perfumed accent, while the palate is medium in weight, with good flow due to lively acidity. Flavors of red fruits are equalized by oaky vanilla and dry herbs, while the finish is lengthy and snappy due to aforementioned core acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Deep and dark, this is an excellent kitchen-sink blend (it includes Carignan, Merlot, Cabernet, Garnacha and Syrah). For those who like expressive, fruity, no-holds-barred wines, you're gonna swoon for this. The palate is super lush and full of dark cherry, tobacco, herbs and spice, while the finish is mile-long. Outwardly impressive in a modern style.",Spain,Red Blend
"Lovers of full-bodied, extracted Priorat wines know Vall Llach, and that cult sees Embruix as a good value. The 2004 is on the right track: the nose is almost impenetrable as it oozes blackberry, tar and fine leather. Meanwhile, the palate is like warm berry compote followed by espresso and dark chocolate. Very rich although not overly complex. Best now with steak or cheese, or hold until 2008.",Spain,Red Blend
"A barrel buster, with huge barrique qualities including char, chocolate and vanilla along with ripe black-fruit aromas. Spirited is the best way to describe this masculine, tannic bruiser, which is a blend of old-vines Garnacha and Carignan. Hold a couple of years to let it settle, then enjoy.",Spain,Red Blend
"Powerful is almost an understatement in describing this big boy. The nose starts out fiery and rough before settling to intense. It's all guns blazing on the palate, where tight, racy raspberry fruit holds court. With intense oak and a molten core generating 15.5% alcohol you may want to tread carefully. The ride is not for the weak. Garnacha with Carignan, Syrah and Cab Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Carignan and Grenache lead the way on this old-vines classic that is typically excellent but not quite as generous, round and whole as in previous vintages. Still, you will be impressed by the compact nose of thyme, sage and tobacco along with dry red fruit. In addition, the palate of cassis and blackberry is pure and tannic as a rock. Needs time; best in 2009–10.",Spain,Red Blend
"Radiator dust, baked apple and other familiar, semirich aromas grace the nose on this more elevated Cava. In the mouth, there's chunkiness, weight and integrity along with a flavor profile that hints at vinegar but settles on cidery apple and kumquat. Nicely done and different from the mass wines Freixenet is known for.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Solid if a bit soupy and tomato-driven on the nose. In the mouth, there's a nice offset between herbal, red fruit characteristics, tobacco and black fruit. Overall, it's a gritty, tight, honest Ribera wine with a long, powerful finish. Just ripe enough, with indviduality and identity. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"One of the best efforts we've tried from Jumilla, Luzon's luxury blend starts with coconut, mint, char and fudge, and below that is a treasure trove of deep black fruit. Huge blackberry and black cherry flavors are potent as they ride on a wave of jolting tannins. An affordable shining star for a rising region.",Spain,Red Blend
"This younger-vines mix of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah is very attractive and loaded with graphite, schisty mineral and black cherry aromas. The palate comes in waves, with the first delivering plum and berry and the second offering chocolate, herbs and lavender. Quite pretty and very tannic. Hold until 2008, if possible.",Spain,Red Blend
"Intense and deep, with plenty of licorice, leather and pepper encasing serious dark-berry aromas. The wine runs round and full in the mouth, with chewy berry flavors, meaty tannins and a generous finish that's long and just a touch lemony from the wine's 20 months in barrel. A wine that speaks to you.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A bit sweet and raisiny on the nose, but also dense and powerful. The palate runs rough and tannic, but there's enough richness and extract to allow for that. Flavors of cassis and raspberry are dark but snappy, while the finish has raisiny notes but also some edge. This one may improve with time; drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts out a bit sweaty and leathery, but soon it turns more smoky. As a whole it's more bulky and barnyardy than most PX wines, with sweet prune and raisin flavors that seem a bit generic. Thick on the finish, with a gooey sweetness throughout.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Dusty, creamy, powdered sugar aromas are nice and easygoing, while the palate has balance and a mouthfeel that caresses solid apple, citrus and peach flavors. Crisp on the finish, with a decent amount of elegance for a $15 wine. Hard to go wrong with this bubbly.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"You want color and heft? You get that here, and more. Dark, grapy aromas are lush more than rough and tight, while the palate is full of sassy black cherry fruit and a fair share of richness. No doubt this jam-packed blend of Garnacha, Merlot and Carignan is solid and rewarding. 250 cases produced.",Spain,Red Blend
"From a brutally hot vintage, this shows plenty of mineral, schist and cola aromas along with impeccably smooth fruit. It's a little racy and sheer in the mouth, but food will balance that without a problem. And along the way you should enjoy the licorice, cherry, kirsch and other crafty nuances that this fine blend of Cabernet, Garnacha and Carignan has to offer. Drink now through 2009.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mildly sweet and candied, with accents of rose petal, red licorice and high-quality raisin. As always, it's an intense wine with red raspberry, cherry and plum flavors in front of finishing vanilla and butter. It's a bit grabby and tannic, but it seems to have harnessed correct ripeness in what was a difficult, hot year.",Spain,Red Blend
"Waxy melon and apple aromas are intricate and welcoming, while the melon and citrus flavors are just as they should be. Do Ferreiro is a consistent high-end producer in Rias Baixas and its '05 Albariño is great. It picks up steam as it goes along and will go great with salads and seafood. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Here's a really good, young Mencia that is sure to win you over. The nose is fully ripe and loaded with pure berry aromas. The juicy mouth is warm and meaty, with pure fruit and chewy tannins. Luna Beberide's Mencia pinpoints the essence of modern Bierzo.",Spain,Mencía
"After a couple of rough years, all Fluminus needed was the good 2004 vintage. And the result is splendid. This blend of Cab, Garnacha and Carignan is pure as can be, with polished leather and fine tobacco aromas entering the fray. The whole is complete and big-boned, but in the end it's more tight and compact than plush. Give it two years to show its best side.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rustic fruit aromas led by the native Samso grape cause a stir, and the wine, which also has Garnacha, Cabernet and Merlot, carries forth in the mouth, where lush blackberry and plum flavors are supported by healthy, spicy, minty oak. With tight tannins and comfortable acidity, it will drink better in a few years. Imported by Bernard Magrez.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dense and spicy on the nose, with tobacco, baked fruit aromas and dry, woody notes. It's a fairly rich, slick and generous Rioja with lightly baked berry fruit flavors, spice cake accents and limited complexity. Solid on the finish, with additional spice notes. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A touch gritty and baked on the nose, and that ripe character persists throughout this semimodern Ribera wine. Along the route there's raisiny notes, baked plum flavors and oak-driven vanilla and spice. On the finish, vanilla is the lasting flavor. Solid and oaky, with some pushy coconut.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean and vibrant, with citrus blossom and apple aromas. The palate is a bit neutral in flavor but shows good cut and a cleansing feel along with tastes of spiced apple and white nectarine. Finishes clean and pure. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Sweet, succulent aromas draw you in and while the wine doesn't deliver much nuance on either the nose or palate, we can't quibble with the power, purity and intensity of the blackberry fruit. It's young, tannic and tough now, so give it two years and it should be an excellent wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet and welcoming; a good deal among pedigreed red wines. The nose on this 100% Monastrell from older vines is mammoth, toasty and dark, while the palate is chunky and virtually melts with blackberry, plum and cherry flavors. A real-deal red with breadth and class. 1,000 cases made.",Spain,Monastrell
"This muscular youth proves that Priorat can deliver fleshy, modern wines. Or maybe it's the 20% Merlot that's softenening the Garnacha and Carignan. Either way, look for lush plum and black cherry flavors floating on a rich, heady palate. This is more Escalade or Range Rover than sports car.",Spain,Red Blend
"Very nice apple blossom and lightly stony aromas greet you, and the apple and apricot flavors are juicy and ripe. This is an all-fruit wine with just enough acidity and minerality to keep it in shape. Finishes with citrus and melon. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Big and yellow, which is evidence of the oak aging on this plump, modern Verdejo that's made in small quantity and will appeal to those who like things such as Sémillon and Chenin Blanc. The body is full, there's fruit, weight and grip, and the ripeness versus minerality is just right. Drink now with cheese or fish. 300 cases produced.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dry, smoky and lightly fruity, this Pinot Noir-based Cava is about as good as it gets in the price range. The nose delivers distant brown sugar and burnt leaves, while the palate lays on the orange rind, peach and cherry skin flavors. Try this classy sparkler; you won't be disappointed.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Spicy and savory smelling, with interesting aromas that encompass maple, chili powder, smoked meat and mildly baked berries. The palate is round and a little rough in the tannic category. But overall this wine is exceedingly pleasant, well made and pretty much ready to drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"If you don't mind some heavy barrel char, then you'll probably like this rough rider. It has espresso and asphalt on the nose, and then you get leathery plum and berry fruit on the palate. A good wine, with a long finish, lots of oak and overall balance. In a nutshell, there's plenty going on.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not often do you come across an aged Valdepeñas red, especially one with style, structure and character. The nose of dried fruits and spices also features cigar box and tomato, while the palate of red plum, cherry and tomato is mature. With some length and intensity to the finish, this is perfect to drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Scala Dei seems to have managed 2003's tough conditions, and this is endowed with sweet Garnacha-driven aromas that touch up against raisiny but don't cross the line. The palate is plump and loaded with strawberry and vanilla flavors, then chocolate shows up on the finish. The blend is 41% Garnacha, 41% Syrah and 18% Cab Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Plenty of intense new oak sets the nose in a direction toward mint, licorice and black pepper. And that's all good, because the palate backs it up  with prime blackberry and cassis flavors. This is a solid wine with slightly pronounced acids and tannins. Not for those averse to a little grab and kick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nicely balanced and a better example of the upside of Navarra than the wines that are based on or include Merlot. The nose shows some herbal character but more deep fruit notes. And in the mouth there's ripe cherry, cassis and plum. Texturally, it's very nice, and when you get down to the nuts and olts it's a very good value.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo
"Carchelo is at its best in this vintage. This is loaded with wild blackberry and leathery sass, too. Typical of Jumilla, it's big, saturated and packed with ripe berry flavors, jabbing tannins and warmth. A true hot-climate country wine but one with polish and pizzazz.",Spain,Monastrell
"Toasty, yeasty and quite composed given the price point. If you like green apples, ripe pears or lychee fruit, chances are you're going to like this well-blended and fairly smooth Cava. It's persistent and structured enough to go with appetizers or main courses.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Raspberry and a touch of citrus peel make for a light, appealing nose, while the red cherry and red apple skin flavors are cheerful, bouncy and attractive. For a basic Garnacha from Campo de Borja, this has it all: color, fresh fruit, balance and character.",Spain,Garnacha
"Rarely do you find musclebound, intense reds priced at $8 that are this good. But Luzon manages to give you a 65/35 blend of Monastrell and Syrah that is lively, loaded and eminently likable. It's all about hefty black fruit, bold tannins and flash. Only 5,000 cases made.",Spain,Red Blend
"Brutal heat didn't do a lot for Mas La Plana in 2003. While still a worthy wine, this one shows some green on the nose and palate, while the balance is weightier than normal. In its favor, there's bold blackberry and a touch of cola on the palate. Good but not up to the wine's usual high standards.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Generally speaking, this is a respectable Priorat from a tough year. The nose is berry packed, while the flavors run toward toast-covered raspberry. It's typically grabby and expansive, as any good young wine from the area will be, yet you can drink it now with meat.",Spain,Red Blend
"There's not much difference between this wine and the label's less expensive Brandal. This is a bit richer, with chunky melon aromas and peach melba flavors. But it may suffer a bit from additional ripeness and lower acidity. For best results, get at it fast.",Spain,Albariño
"A little weighty, with ripe apple and peach aromas. Fairly succulent in the mouth, with apple and citrus flavors that are both sweet and a touch chewy. Some pith on the finish adds complexity and overall you can't knock the wine's character. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"In 2005 this winery got a great harvest, and it's evident in this ripe, clean Garnacha that hits with jammy aromas and a ton of fresh-fruit flavors. Juicy, smooth and earnest is how to describe this tasty bargain from a region that doesn't always shine this bright.",Spain,Garnacha
"Heat from the 2003 vintage aside, this is one sweet, forward, dark-colored Cava. The nose is all about cheeky, sweet fruit, while the palate offers more berry sweetness along with vanilla. Normally this bottling is more restrained and striated, but 2003 was a warm year. May be better with desserts than appetizers, given the ripeness.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Nothing wrong with this pleasant, friendly Cava. The nose boasts frosted breakfast cereal and lemon curd, while the palate is defined by spiced apple and baked citrus. It gets more honeyed and fat as it opens, although a good chilling will keep that in check.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Nice and fruity, with a touch of spice to the nose. The palate is plump and dark, with nothing besides all-natural fruit. A hearty and healthy wine that boasts freshness and purity but no oak.",Spain,Mencía
"Fairly bold and ripe up front, with dark berry aromas and an almond candy undercurrent. The palate is a bit more red-fruit based than the bouquet, and the flavors of raspberry and red plums are satisfying a touch tangy. Interesting, with drying tannins on the finish.",Spain,Mencía
"Classic in every sense, from the early aromas of dill butter to the dry, acid-driven palate to the light, crisp finish. In a world where so many wines are going ripe and heavy, this one holds steady to the traditional. So if you're looking for an old-school Spanish red to go with tortilla espanola or lamb chops, this will do the trick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light and floral on the nose, and medium in intensity and acidity. Flavors of apple, green melon and citrus are clean and crisp, and overall the wine is a model of freshness. Drink it sooner rather than later; it's a touch on the soft side.",Spain,Verdejo
"With its black plum, blackberry and other bold, juvenile aromas, this bargain-priced Spaniard shows flavors of chocolate, natural bitterness and good overall balance. A little big and brawny, but better than washed out and weak. A classic chorizo or hamburger wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Moderately dark and dense, but hardly brooding and deep. This is a nice, zesty version of Mencia that highlights the grape's cherry and raspberry character. It's flush and features good fruit-to-acid balance.",Spain,Mencía
"No doubt this wine possesses peppery, herbal qualities. But before it's dismissed as green we'd like to note that there's also a nice savory side to it. More herbal than vegetal, and with decent balance. With food this wine will do just fine; on its own it may seem a touch reedy and rough.",Spain,Red Blend
"Plump, melony and ripe on the nose, with creamy pear, melon and banana flavors. Normally this wine is more racy and acidic than this, but the '05 seems tropical relative to previous years. Still, it's a good wine that will go down nicely if properly chilled. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"The Eguren brothers of Sierra Cantabria and other projects always do a nice job with this Tempranillo from central Spain. It's a no-frills, bulky red with rich fruit and bacon aromas backed by bold boysenberry and blackberry flavors. There's no shortage of voltage in this tight, jabby, slightly clumsy red.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This Cabernet-Tempranillo blend is even-keeled and solid from start to finish. The palate shows good raspberry and cherry fruit, and the mouthfeel holds its form until the very end, when a touch of tomato and oak enter the picture. A nice wine for the money.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"It's already too late for an '04 Albariño, but this one still has some life and kick in it. The nose has some peanut and lacquer, but overall apple aromas ride high. In the mouth, it shows the oily quality of an aging white along with peach, citrus and nut flavors.",Spain,Albariño
"This Cab-Merlot blend delivers nice tobacco, char and dark fruit aromas, which are backed by plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors. Like most Navarran reds, there's some lettuce and other green characteristics. But for the most part the wine's balance, charm and mouthfeel win you over.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Young and bouncy, with jammy aromas of raspberries and strawberries. Immediately you know this has Tempranillo at the core, and fans should appreciate the pleasant combination of meaty flavors, a round body, solid ripeness and a good price.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Opens with aromas of tobacco and dried leaves as well as plum and cherry, and that's backed by raspberry, plum and cherry tomato flavors. For an older wine, it's showing life, acidity and some old-school style. What it doesn't have are any of those New World characteristics, i.e. black fruit, chocolate and weight.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"There is much to like about this wine, particularly the cola and roasted fruit flavors that control the palate. But in front and back of that likable intermezzo is a sharp, prickly bouquet and a mouthfeel that's slightly grabby, tannic and elastic. Good but you want it to be better. Drink now.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"This offers chewy plum and berry flavors along with a finishing wave of vanilla, chocolate and coconut. It's fruity and forward, if a bit rubbery on the finish.",Spain,Shiraz-Tempranillo
"There's more than enough to like about this red-fruit driven middleweight. It's sure handed and fruity, with enough grip, balance and character that it doesn't sway from that base-level quality line.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bring on the funk, at least at first. This new-to-America wine gets out of the gate with wild leather, stable and bramble aromas, and there's always an aggressive, untamed quality to it. But with air it settles, and eventually true Tempranillo flavors emerge. More challenging than it should be.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"The nose deals perfume, sawdust and even some fruit, while tobacco, cassis and blackberry flavors are adequate if not overly impressive. More interesting than some in its class, with a few flaws along with virtues.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Leafy and minty up front, with jumpy fruit that runs toward tomato and pepper. It's a rugged little wine with hot and spicy oak notes along with some dill and burnt coffee. Not offensive but not exactly regal.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Vanilla and dill aromas are front and center. The palate imparts plum skin and red-apple flavors, with lots of rough tannins holding the feel hostage. There just isn't a lot of meat on the bones, so it comes across like a mouth full of hardware. Imported by Luneau USA Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe, warm and spicy on the nose, with standard red berry aromas and flavors. The mix is Tempranillo, Cab and Syrah, which is unusual. Yet the wine tastes perfectly open and familiar, as if you've had it and enjoyed it before. Nothing special but it's good and fruity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"An older wine with more oak than jazzy fruit, so the aromas are heavy with the scent of cinnamon and the palate is more drying and spicy than it is rich and rewarding. Still, with the right food you may be able to appreciate the wine's smoke and vanilla qualities.",Spain,Mencía
"Navarran Merlot often leans toward the vegetal. There's bell pepper and tomato on the nose, but also balancing red plum, cherry and raspberry on the palate. It's a touch sheer, scratchy and green, but the effort is there and by no means is it a bad, herbaceous wine.",Spain,Merlot
"Raspberry and strawberry aromas offer a reasonably good opening, backed by sweet strawberry and vanilla flavors. A bit sticky and candied, but overall it's friendly and round enough to make the grade.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite heavy; in fact, a touch too much. The nose is defined by corn and apple cider, while the palate is heavy and melony, with a lot of unbounded sweetness and softness. Needs more overt acidity and citrus to achieve proper balance.",Spain,Verdejo
"Interesting in that this fresh, snappy table wine includes 60% Airen (a white grape) in addition to Tempranillo. This odd combo results in a light-bodied, almost translucent wine that's easy to drink but offers little in the way of heft or complexity.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rather dilute and basic, with a touch of buttercup to the sweet, mellow nose. In the mouth there's almond skin, melon and mild citrus flavors, while the finish is fresh enough despite being fleshy. Simple but fine; drink immediately.",Spain,Viura
"In no way is this up to the high standards of other Tirants. The 2003 is overly woody and shy on the rich, saturated fruit that it's supposed to deliver. It's O.K., but very leafy, dry and tight.",Spain,Red Blend
"First, second and third nosings all result in the same finding: that this Cava smells a lot like lettuce. In the mouth, scattered citrus and apple flavors are acceptable, and while the mouthfeel is fine, it just doesn't hit the spot or trigger much excitement.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The sweet, oddly spicy nose stirs some intrigue, and that's likely derived from the Grenache. Yet despite reasonably good flavors, it bounces along like a truck on a gravel road. It just doesn't have much balance, mouthfeel or charm.",Spain,Garnacha
"Smells whole, so you're hopeful going in. But the palate is stark and rather raw, while the flavors of raspberry and cherry are limited. A palate slammer with harsh tannins. Tempranillo 65%/Cabernet Sauvignon 35%.",Spain,Red Blend
"Already past its prime, this Garnacha-based rosado has sweet nectarine aromas along with a sugary, creamy palate. If it had more zest upon release, that's mostly gone at this stage. Wait for the 2006.",Spain,Garnacha
"Campo de Borja can produce some strange wines, and at the head of the class would be this rooty, tomato-laden wine that's at one point sweet but then bland and cooked at the next. A varietal Garnacha from a hot vintage that just isn't worth the price.",Spain,Garnacha
"Burnt and seemingly weedy at first, this heavily oaked 100% Garnacha is initially downright weird and baked. In the final analysis it's all wood and medicinal fruit. Not a personal favorite.",Spain,Garnacha
"Initial sweet-plum aromas are as good as it gets. Raisin enters the picture, and eventually you've got a  heavy, clumsy, overly ripe wine that tastes and smells mostly of sappy oak and coconut.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cloudy red in color, with musky berry aromas. The palate shows some cherry and raspberry, while the feel is sort of rough. A classic country wine that isn't about to rock anyone's world.",Spain,Tempranillo
"No matter how you slice this up, it comes out smelling and tasting sharp and burnt. The nose is brambly and fiery, while the mouth is peppery and rough. Hard and jagged at every turn, thus you need the pan y arroz (bread and rice), to absorb the wine's kick.",Spain,Red Blend
"Prune and other overweight aromas carry the nose, and the palate is raisiny. Not rough by any means, but a lot of dead weight drags it down.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Heavy and quite herbal, with strong tomato and molasses flavors. The feel of this wine is chunky and broad, yet the edges are sheer and sharp. It requires too much patience and shows too many flaws to rate better.",Spain,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is over the hill and showing mostly vegetal papaya and green melon aromas and flavors. There's not much spunk or style left, so wait for the 2006 and drink that wine upon release; Fransola has never aged well.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Solid on the nose, with pure berry aromas matched by oak-related vanilla. Fresh and medium in weight, with juicy acidity and mild tannins. Tastes of dried red fruits, blackberry, vanilla and tobacco. Fairly long and slightly elegant on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A bit heavy and corny, with a strong influence of tortilla and corn chips on the nose. On the palate, it's crisp, with modest flavors of salt, baked apple and dried papaya. Dry, mellow and ultimately short on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Smoky and roasted on the nose, it also has standard red-berry aromas lurking in the background. This feels fairly full and healthy, with sweet-oak flavors accenting lightly-pickled-tasting red berry. It finishes a bit herbal, with lasting minty, oaky flavors.",Spain,Red Blend
"Bacon, rubber and berry fruit aromas comprise the bouquet. Feels crisp on the palate, with roasted berry flavors and herb and pepper accents. It feels warm on the finish, with herbal leanings and some roughness.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is big and bacony on the nose, with herbal berry aromas and notes of spice and more. It feels lifted and nervy, with vital, almost volatile acidity and resiny, oak-led flavors of vanilla and black fruit. This is minty, spicy and aggressive on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is bulky on the nose, with meaty, rubbery aromas. It feels more snappy and acidic on the tongue, with zesty acids pushing tomato, red plum and herb flavors. Long and steady on the finish, with additional tomato-based tang.",Spain,Garnacha
"Stretched and woody on the nose, with not much fruit. It feels wide, grabby and tannic, with leathery, herbal berry flavors. Grabby on the finish, this is still quite tannic and a bit tough on the palate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty, chunky peach and apple aromas find a second gear with airing. This feels round, with mild acidity and flavors that range from apple and citrus to sweet banana. The finish is mostly smooth and full flavored, albeit sweet.",Spain,Verdejo
"This is one dark, intense Ribera del Duero with loads of lush black-fruit aromas matched against minerality and fine French-oak scents. It is tight as a drum on the palate, with wiry acidity and rocky tannins. Flavors of oak-driven coconut and cream sit on top of blackberry and cola, while the finish ends abruptly, with hardness. Drink through 2024; 150 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is a ripe, rich blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah that opens with blackberry, blueberry and earthy leather aromas. It's full bodied, lifted by nice acids and layered, with toast, meaty blackberry, licorice and roasted flavors. A chewy, smooth, deep finish functions as the final chapter. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is every bit as good as the winery's Clave de Tábula, which costs twice as much. An aromatic opening of fig, prune and blackberry comes with graphite, cola and attractive oak notes. This is intense and shows powerful acidity in support of blackberry, toast and dark, spicy flavors. A medium-long finish with toast and licorice is proper and not overdone. Drink from 2014–2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This blend of 90% Viura and 10% Malvasia gives off scents of saline and pool water along with apple, citrus and green herb notes. The palate is zesty and high in acid, leaving a clipped feel and flavors of lime, pineapple and green apple. It's nicely built but modest in its overall expression.",Spain,White Blend
"The palate on this wine is clean, lemony and lean, with pithy citrus, apple and vanilla flavors. The best thing about the finish is that it doesn't fall apart.",Spain,Viura-Chardonnay
"Nettle, green herb and sweaty, varietal Verdejo aromas control the bouquet on this barrel-aged white. The palate is oily in feel, with pithy flavors of apricot, apple and grapefruit. The finish mixes baked white-fruit flavors with lasting bitterness and oak.",Spain,Verdejo
"This is a big, ripe Garnacha with raisiny aromas, gumminess and green hints to the bouquet. The palate is thick and chewy, with tannic clamp and flavors of pastry, berry jelly and lactic blueberry. On the finish, things revert to raisin and prune.",Spain,Garnacha
"This Macabeo-Chardonnay blend is light on its feet, with minerally aromas of saline and peach. It's fresh but ordinary in the mouth, with apple and melon flavors in front of a dry, dusty finish. This will do the trick with basic appetizers.",Spain,Macabeo-Chardonnay
"This wine is dusty on the nose, with aromas of red pepper flake, citrus and red fruits. It's fleshy in the mouth and showing grip along with flavors of pomegranate, pink grapefruit and tangerine. Solid, cleansing and dry on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Garnacha
"This standard Garnacha is good and honest on the nose, with fresh red-berry aromas. In the mouth, it's snappy and kind of lean, with a lightweight composition and zesty flavors of raspberry and cherry. It's quick to finish, with a note of vanilla.",Spain,Grenache
"Fresh berry aromas get this under-$10 value going in the right direction. In the mouth, this feels jammy, fruity and fleshy, while clean flavors of plum and dark berries come with modest oak and spice accents. A reasonably long finish deals flavors of mint and toast.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark plum and berry aromas hit with oomph and are accented by toasty, minerally notes. This Mencía is balanced and nicely textured, with blackberry, prune and licorice flavors. Some bitterness comes up on the finish, but mostly this ends like it starts, with jammy richness and dark-fruit notes.",Spain,Mencía
"Despite showing jammy, raisiny aromas, this wide and thick Tempranillo shows just enough acidity to maintain balance. Dense flavors of prune and berry lead to a chewy, medium-length finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's a lot of acid, tomato and green notes to this wine from a cool, tough vintage. In the mouth, it's electric due to blazing acidity, while up front on the palate you'll get zesty red plum and cherry flavors, while later on spice and vanilla come into play. A snappy, tart, tangy finish is the close.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Smells clean as a mountain stream, with apple, peach and mellow citric aromas. Shows medium intensity and controlled citrusy acids along with grapefruit, pineapple and passion fruit flavors that come largely from the 20% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend; the rest is 70% Chardonnay and 10% the local Picapoll grape. Interesting, and a very good Catalonian white wine to match with seafood.",Spain,White Blend
"Sweet, jammy and a touch raisiny on the bouquet, with a roasted quality summing things up. Feels more acidic than expected, with zest and juiciness pushing flavors of blackberry mixed with tobacco and vanilla. Finishes herbal and oaky, but ripe and ready.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with waxy, sweet aromas of yellow apples and honey. Feels good, round and balanced, with Golden Delicious apple flavors sweetened by honey drippings and melon. Stays sweet but maintains a fruit component on the finish even as the texture and intensity dissipate. Good for varietal Xarel-lo.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"This is a powerful, rich, toasty Garnacha, with grit, earth and spice galore on the bouquet. It feels tough, masculine and tannic, with a mix of beefy black-fruit flavors elevated by molasses and spice. Firm and showing some burn on the finish, along with notes of black licorice and peppery spice. Only 200 cases made. Drink now–2016.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is a bit wayward and cheesy on the nose, but on the palate it's good and smooth. It tastes sweet, with a burnt brown-sugar flavor and mild bitterness on the back palate. The finish is sweet and slightly maderized.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Jammy and mildly baked on the bouquet, with cinnamon, matchstick and blueberry aromas. It's full and tannic, with a mix of stewed fruit, brown sugar, spice and tomato making up the flavor profile. The woody and chunky finish has herb and tomato notes.",Spain,Bobal
"Hickory smoke and rubber band aromas control the nose. It feels stretched and acidic, with zesty plum and raspberry flavors. Oaky vanilla and creamy flavors surface, which lead to a long but undistinguished finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"A bit oily on the bouquet, this has slightly acrid notes of burnt hay and matchstick, with notes of apple and nectarine.

"Apple and orange aromas are light and slightly toasted. The palate is easygoing. Flavors of orange and nectarine are fresh and appropriate for Cava. The finish is solid, fresh and alert.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dusty cherry aromas are basic and open, but not complex. The mouthfeel on this Cava is a bit foamy, while red-fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry carry a citrusy offset. A touch of bitterness rises up on what is otherwise a good, healthy finish.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Like with past vintages, prominant pineapple and apple aromas come across pleasantly but with a slightly bitter tinge. The palate is concentrated with green apple and nectarine flavors. The finish falls off and loses some flavor as it moves along.",Spain,Albariño
"Toasty, roasted aromas of baked berry and earth head straight to a narrowly built yet weighty palate with earth, plum and raspberry notes. On the finish, this holds onto its plum and raspberry flavors as well as its fresh feel.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Plum, berry and a noticeable oaky streak define the bouquet on this well-built Rioja. Flavors of raspberry and plum are creamy and end with thickness and full-bodied grip that's balanced off by good acidity. This is perfectly good, healthy and adequately fruity, yet woody.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Subtle and sweet on the nose, it has aromas of honey, peach and melon. Standard nettle, gooseberry and slightly-mealy citrus flavors mark the palate. This finishes chunky yet easygoing. Drink immediately.",Spain,Verdejo
"This has berry fruit aromas that don't fully register as crisp and spunky. It feels narrow and tastes tart and tangy, with red plum and cherry pie flavors. Punchy and refreshing.",Spain,Rosé
"The earthy-smelling aromas of red berry and plum are snappy and rustic. It feels fresh, zesty and deep, with bright but basic tasting berry flavors that transition to chocolate and herb before the scratchy feeling finish. This is a good wine with moderate depth and complexity.",Spain,Monastrell
"Rugged and roasted on the bouquet, with rubbery blackberry and freshly laid tar aromas. It feels big and solid, but simple, with raspberry, strawberry and a hint of green herb on the palate. The finish is mild tasting, with a cocoa note.",Spain,Garnacha-Monastrell

"Rich yet subdued on the bouquet, with elegant tobacco, lemon peel and earthy scents, this feels lush and full of heft, but it's not plodding or heavy. Flavors of spiced black fruit, molasses and tobacco are nice, and the finish features a long, dry, comfortable fade. Drink this winner now–2016.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Earthy, roasted aromas of dry berry and leathery spice are alluring. The wine feels mature but forward, with a mild, resiny oak note driving the roasted red-berry, tobacco, spice and lemon flavors. It feels smooth and plush on the finish, with structure and spine. Drink now–2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fresh berry and cherry aromas define the bouquet. In the mouth, this is cleansing and full of acidity. Medicinal oak and red-fruit flavors carry the flavor profile to a finish with spice flavors, acidity and mild burn.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Briny white-fruit aromas and yeasty notes comprise the nose. This is compact on the palate and not showing much in the way of bubbles, while flavors of pickled melon and green apple finish with a briny suggestion of vinaigrette.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This small-production blend from Ribeiro is fragrant, with vibrant red-berry and floral aromas. In the mouth, it's tangy and lean, with more acidity than body. Flavors are mostly generic in nature, leaning towards cherry and plum, while the finish is raw. This is more of a food wine than a sipper.",Spain,Red Blend
"The palate on this Tempranillo has smacking acids that create crisp flavors of raspberry and red plum, and there's a pinch of oaky vanilla for counterbalance. Overall this is juicy, fresh and simple.",Spain,Tempranillo
"For an inexpensive wine, this offers plenty of wood spice, vanilla, char and toast on the nose. The palate smacks hard with drawing tannins, while flavors of medicinal plum and raspberry carry a charred aftertaste. Good as a whole, with oak dominating the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dense berry aromas give this wine a pasty, weighty bouquet. It feels scratchy in the mouth, with plum and red-fruit flavors. This wine runs short on  specifics while offering a juicy feel and a hint of chocolaty young oak on the finish.",Spain,Tinta de Toro

"Apple, lime, lemon and natural vanilla are the aromas one gets from this blended Catalonian white.

"This is a ripe, dark but balanced Toro with pastry, prune, blackberry and vanilla aromas. The palate is fiercely tannic on the surface but not overly hard at the foundation.

"Very sweet on the nose, this has aromas of prune, raisin and nutmeg. It feels surprisingly acidic given the sweet-leaning aromas, with full tannins and berry and smoky oak flavors. The finish is tasty and long.",Spain,Monastrell
"Red in color, with sweet aromas of sugar beet, Red Delicious apple and cherry. It feels zesty, with simple flavors of red fruit and red apple. The finish is dry and a touch peppery. Drink immediately while it's fresh.",Spain,Rosé
"Dark, meaty and ripe, the bouqiet has a strong wave of herb and carob notes. It feels grabby almost to the point of cloying, with heavily oaked flavors of roasted black fruit and milk chocolate. This is oak dominated, but full and chocolaty.",Spain,Garnacha
"Charcoal, cola and menthol aromas sit on top of blueberry and mint. The mouth is so tannic and powerful that it's tough to swallow. Incredibly ripe, this has a short finish that's toasty tasting and not complex in the least.",Spain,Petite Verdot

"Black cherry, cassis and oak-based aromas define the nose on this dark Cabernet from Catalonia. The palate is solid but a little pointed, while wild berry, black cherry and mocha flavors end with oak, plum and berry flavors. For $11 Cab, this is high in quality and ready to drink.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This Garnacha is maderized, with leafy aromas of burnt rubber, herbs, tea and spice more than bold fruit. The palate has a light feel, with buttery creaminess and flavors of vanilla, butter, licorice, black cherry, cassis and medicinal raisin. The finish is a bit hot and raw.",Spain,Garnacha
"Gritty plum, peppery spice and herbal aromas lead to a tangy, fairly high-acid palate. The flavors are a mix of earthiness, pasty berry and red currant, while the finish is short, juicy and lightly oaked. For $10 it's a fair wine.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"This white smells open and leesy, with melony accents. The palate feels zesty but simple, with dilute, tart flavors of citrus and apple. The finish falls off quickly and ends up tasting bland. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño

"This wine smells hard and lemony, and thus it's not surprising that the palate feels citric and tangy, with hard tannins. The flavor profile includes lemony oak, rubbery red fruit and mild earthy flavors in front of a drying finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Prickly, briny citrus aromas announce a juicy, acidic wine that dances on the palate while delivering flavors of lime, briny apple and nettle. Things stay prickly and turn bitter on the back side. 50% each Verdejo and Viura.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Tight on the nose but also a bit oxidized and yeasty smelling. Feels more tangy and juicy than Alvear's Fino en Rama, with forward acidity, bite and cut. Flavorwise, there's a heavy dose of nuts, apricot and citrus followed by a zesty finish.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Cherry and plum aromas come with a dusty note, however things turn sharper and more brambly with airing. It feels citrusy and choppy, with sweet-and-sour flavors of raspberry and red plum. Juicy, but fiery on the finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"Roasted and rubbery on the nose, this has herb and leaf accents. It feels thick, chunky and a bit syrupy, with flavors of herb, mint and roasted blackberry. This turns grittier on the finish, with bacon, hickory and rubbery flavors. A blend of 50% Monastrell and 50% Syrah.",Spain,Monastrell-Syrah
"For freshness and elegance in an unoaked wine, look no further than this leesy, smooth Albariño that shouts of its coastal origin. Sea notes, apple and peach grace the bouquet, while the plump but zesty palate offers minerally lemon, lime and apple flavors.",Spain,Albariño
"Dusty spice and red-berry aromas are a fine opening to this blend of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah. It's fairly full bodied but not heavy, with fine balance and bright flavors of cherry and berry that come in layered waves. A toasty, dry finish with spice and good acidity closes out this easy-to-like Spanish red. Drink through 2017.",Spain,Red Blend
"By and large, this is a good Priorat to drink or hold, because it should still improve. Both the bouquet and palate are oaky and fiery, with cherry, raspberry and vanilla flavors. On the finish, things turn buttery before settling on rooty and staunch. The more air this gets, the more it comes around. Drink now through 2018.",Spain,Red Blend
"Heavy, raisiny aromas carry heat and a whiff of vinegar. In the mouth, this is thick and almost syrupy. Earthy flavors of blackberry, raisin and prune finish chewy but flat. Look for a ripe, rich wine that's soft and earthy more than structured.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly minty plum and cherry aromas lead to a medium-bodied palate with snappy acidity. Flavors of red berries and juicy plum come with spicy, peppery side notes, while raspberry is the key flavor on the finish along with peppery spice.",Spain,Red Blend

"Dense, fruity and rock-solid as Ribera goes, this has aromas of cassis and blackberry that are full and lusty. The palate is thick and saturated, with rich black-fruit flavors, finishing long  and potent. Drink now–2017.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy berry aromas are touched up by rich, ample amounts of wood smoke and spice. It feels tight, tannic and almost tough, with leather, lemony oak and tobacco flavors accenting a core of blackberry. Robust, long and smoky on the finish. Drink 2015–2017.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dry spice and brick-dust aromas frame common berry scents. In the mouth, this is surprisingly sharp, with acidity in the lead. Flavors of tart berry are midlevel, and there's mild sourness and herbal notes in the background. For Muga, this is exceedingly crisp as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromatically speaking, there's bacon and plastic-like notes to the nose along with generic berry scents. The palate is medium in size and intense, with bold cherry and plum flavors as well as oaky backing. It finishes short, with rubbery accents and a distinct clove flavor.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"This is a stewed, raisiny wine on the nose, while in the mouth it's more acidic and flush, but not quite elegant or sophisticated. The palate deals a short burst of heavy plum and berry flavor, and the finish is jammy and ripe but lacks complexity.",Spain,Garnacha
"Contrary to the fresher and more focused 2009 Brut Nature from Sonim, this bubbly shows stalky corn and acrid aromas along with apple and green herb notes. There's some elegance to the palate but overall it's tart and limited, with strong citric acids and only a hint of yeasty stuffing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is punchy and angular up front, with herbal red-fruit aromas. The palate feels fresh, a bit acidic, with peppery, mildly oaky flavors of plum and berry. This is a standard wine with ample body and some oak.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"This barrel-fermented Viura opens with dry, dusty aromas of baked apple and almond butter. It's a simple but satisfying wine, with tangy acidity and flavors of gooseberry, citrus and green apple. And it handles its oak well, something that can't be said about many barrel-fermented Riojas.",Spain,Viura
"Pithy lime aromas get this fresh Chardonnay going. The palate is citrusy in feel, with a mix of lime, grapefruit and orange flavors that are limited in scope and complexity but clean.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Neutral aromas suggest peach, apple and minerality. Solid, compact and healthy on the palate, with peach and white pepper flavors. Good on the finish but starting to show some maturity; at peak level now so drink immediately or wait for the 2011.",Spain,Albariño
"Pinched smelling at first, with a note of turpentine. Airing eliminates that burn, leaving standard nut and vanilla aromas. Feels good and lively, with refreshing acidity and nutty, dry flavors of white fruits including peach and apricot. Finishes long and fresh.",Spain,Palomino
"Starts out somewhat fiery, with a dose of aromatic horseradish. After airing out, this varietal Tempranillo is fresh, juicy and crisp on the tongue, with flavors of baking spices, tomato, roasted plum and earth. Feels juicy on the finish, maybe a bit lean, and overall it's cut from the classic cloth.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stalky and sweet smelling, this has aromas of beets and rhubarb pie. The palate offers weight, depth and a firm feel, with sweet berry flavors that come with herb and mint accents. It's warm on the finish, with length.",Spain,Garnacha
"Opens with tolerable green tobacco and green bean aromas interspersed with black-fruit notes and earth. It feels astringent and supertannic, with leathery, herbal berry flavors. Same on the finish, which is rough in feel and tastes herbal.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet and heavily oaked, with candied fruit, loads of vanilla and milk chocolate-covered raisin aromas. Feels choppy on one hand and lactic on the other, with mostly oak-based, sweet flavors of maple, vanilla and mocha. Feels O.K. but creamy on the finish, and it tastes candied and artificial throughout.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Flourescent pink in color, like Day-Glo paint. It smells of sweet plum and berry; the palate is crisply acidic, with citrus and tart red-fruit flavors. The finish is crisp and cleansing but regular.",Spain,Rosé
"Gritty, toasty and burnt smelling, with stalky aromas of burning hay and rubber. It feels solid, with herbal flavors of tomato and basil that are given heft via additional flavors of grilled beef and leather. This has a medium-long on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"This is lightly baked and sweet on the nose, with a hint of plastic and raisin as the bouquet opens. It feels fresh and a bit sharp, with tangy red-plum and currant flavors followed by bland oak. The finish is tart and acidic.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is mustardy smelling, with salad-like aromas. It feels round, plump and a little heavy, with spiced apple and mild citrus flavors. Chunky in feel and briny in taste on the finish. Not as good as past vintages.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dusty red-fruit aromas come with earthy, leathery tones. It feels tight, drawn and resiny, with hard spice and oak flavor. There's not much fruit to ponder, and the finish is dried out, with a woody note.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Broken up on the nose, with a nutty, leafy set of over-the-hill aromas. Feels soupy, with hard acids and flavors of tomato, herbs and heavy sweetness. It shows a few good qualities but not enough to rate better.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Burnt and leathery smelling, with aromas of earth, rubber and baked fruit. It feels rough and grabby, with dry spice, cinnamon and roasted berry flavors. The finish is abrasive, with some warmth.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells a touch rubbery on the nose, but mostly it is an excellent high-end Rioja with leather, tobacco and red fruit aromas. The wine shows structure and solidity on the tongue, with dry, spicy red-berry flavors matched by a note of tobacco. Tight, dry and healthy-feeling on the finish. Drink now–2020.",Spain,Red Blend
"Gramona is known for yeasty, complex sparklers, and this falls into that paradigm. The nose is definitely yeasty, with apple and green melon aromas. It's a bit soft for Cava, but that's because it's an '05 that rested on lees for years. Flavors of toasted bread and apple are long on complexity and short on fruit, but once again that's what distinguishes Gramona from the masses.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Cherry and crisp red currant aromas are racy and tutti-frutti in character. The palate delivers kick and acidity in addition to dry, pithy flavors of citrus fruits and nectarine. Dryness persists onto the finish, which is friendly but modest.",Spain,Rosé
"This is floral on the nose, but also candied smelling. So don't be surprised that the palate, while friendly and fruity, is also sticky in feel with a syrupy core flavor that's suggestive of residual sugar. That said, this jellybean is an easy drinker.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dusty aromas of apple and vanilla break up fast as the wine shows oxidized notes. The palate feels narrow and lemony, while the flavor profile is one dimensional and settles on lemon and tart apple. On the finish, things turn stalky in flavor and acidic in feel.",Spain,Albariño
"This single-pago wine is earthy, rooty, herbal and almost grassy smelling. The mouthfeel is clampy, with dried berry, herbal shadings and a chunky, earthy finish. As a whole there's a malty character to this wine, but it has elements of quality and character.",Spain,Red Blend
"This blend is crisp and reasonably well focused on the bouquet. In the mouth, the wine is rubbery and tannic feeling, with mild astringency and flavors of generic berry fruit, oak and herbs. Good for basic occasions.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Overall this wine is decent at best. It's distinctly rustic and herbal on the nose, with leafy, leathery aromas along with stewed fruit scents. The palate has a good feel to it, by far the wine's chief attribute, but the flavors echo the bouquet via leafy, herbal plum and buttery oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Burnt, stalky, toasted aromas dominate this inexpensive Garnacha, and there's not much freshness to the nose as a result. In the mouth, it's more of the same; things are heavy, with fully oaked flavors of medicinal berry, hickory and barbecued meat.",Spain,Garnacha
"Clean, fresh and full of bright cherry and strawberry aromas. Offers the right size and balance, with red plum and red berry flavors touched up by light oak. Mildy toasty and textured on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Soft and stewy up front, without a whole lot of vigor. It feels wide and hard, with abrasive tannins and strained flavors of herbal berry and leather. On the finish it's earthy, tannic and warm, with a weedy note along with barrel spice.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This is cedary and dry smelling, with more spice than fruit aromas. It feels crisp, tight and acidic, with flavors of raspberry, red plum and forced spice coming from the heavy oak. Dry, oaky and spicy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Herbal to the max, with strong bell pepper and pimiento aromas. It feels clacky, with salty, herbal flavors of blackberry and dark plum. Warm almost to the point of being hot on the finish, with burnt notes as well as acidic zip.",Spain,Red Blend
"As it smells blowsy, stalky and oily, this is probably already past its freshness point. It feels chunky and sort of flat, with mealy apple flavors leading to a honeyed finish that feels fleshy. This is a blend of 50% Viura, 40% Chardonnay and 10% Muscat.",Spain,White Blend
"Quiet up front, with dull, candied aromas of black cherry and plum. This feels bullish and grabby, with clipped, crisp flavors of red plum and cherry pie filling. Fresh, but it comes up short on flavor on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Floral and fruity smelling, this also has notes of dry earth and asphalt. It feels tangy and tomatoey, with saucy flavors of red cherry, tomato and herbs. The finish is herbal, with flavors of oregano and rosemary amplified by zingy acidity.",Spain,Garnacha
"With aromas of milk-chocolate-covered cherries and forced oak, this smells overtly sweet and candied. This feels choppy and juicy, with red fruit flavors and buttery oak in the background. It turns sweeter and more buttery on the finish, but doesn't offer much complexity.",Spain,Grenache Blend
"A funky, lean wine that's all over the place. The nose is fiery, with cardamom and notes of sweet peppers and candied berries. It feels clampy but juicy, with flavors of cumin, cardamom, sour plum and raspberry. It finishes acidic.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stemmy, earthy aromas of cherry and hard spice lead to a rough palate with hard cherry and berry flavors. It blackens up on a pounding finish; this is edgy and rough stuff.",Spain,Tempranillo
Mild raspberry and tomato aromas precede a grabby-feeling wine with sandpaper tannins and flavors of medicinal plum and tomato. It comes across loud but raw and unrefined.,Spain,Tempranillo
"This is rubbery smelling, with distinct whiffs of leather and grilled meat. Sheer, tangy and acidic, this has a burnt, gritty flavor that blends with cherry and tart plum. It's minty and somewhat dilute on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromas of white pepper and nettle are about as fresh as it gets. The rest is falling off, with bitterness and oxidation. Acceptable but bland and bitter on the tail end.",Spain,Verdejo
"Stalky aromas give off the impression of corn and funk. It feels ultrasnappy, with medicinal fruit, forced oak and berry flavors that don't really click. The finish is grating and slightly bitter.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells flat and stewy, with jammy sweetness and little punch. Conversely, it's pointy on the palate, with tart, generic red-berry flavors and warmth on the finish. A blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This a good Cava that delivers strawberry and raspberry aromas along with a raspy, scratchy side note. The palate feels good and honest, while sweet, lightly candied flavors of cherry and berry set up a mild finish with fresh acidity and length.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Cola, bacon and rooty berry aromas define the bouquet on this Merlot-led blend. The palate is raw in feel, with hard acidity not finding much padding. Flavors of raspberry and red plum are accented by vanilla and oak, while the finish offers more of the same.",Spain,Red Blend
"Black fruit, clove, char and mocha are the primary aromas on this heavily oaked, saturated Monastrell. The palate shows bullish tannins, bold acids and weight, while dark-leaning flavors of blackberry, stewed plum and mint come with enough acidity to cut through the wine's fat and oak.",Spain,Monastrell
"Quite earthy and nutty on the nose, this features scents of leather, peanut, licorice and raisin. The mouthfeel is smooth, steady and layered, with dry plum, raspberry and plenty of spice and toast. It turns mostly toward tobacco and vanilla on the finish. Very nice and friendly; drink now–2017.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This luxury Cava is entirely clean and pure on the bouquet. The palate is bright, lifted and zesty for a 2006, with apple, dry spice and lingering citrus notes. The body is defined by its yeasty weight and foam but it's not heavy or dull. Only 100 cases of this beauty were made. Drink now–2015.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"After a gaseous, rubbery-smelling start, this Catalonian blend falls into place. The palate is ripped in feel, showing impressive drive and power. Flavors of cola, toast, chocolate, prune and blackberry are generous, while the finish is dense and chocolaty, with a tobacco accent. Drink now–2015.",Spain,Red Blend
"This basic Ribera smells a lot like compost. The feel is sticky, while the flavors lean towards herbal and oaky, with a weedy note thrown in. It tastes a bit green and feels weighty on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Plum and cherry aromas seem a touch oxidized. The palate holds it together but doesn't offer much, while flavors of chunky berry and plum are hollow and show additional oxidation. Like many inexpensive 2011 rosés, this is past its prime.",Spain,Rosé
"Raisin and brick dust aromas get this mature wine going. The palate feels blocky and closed, with firm tannins and strong acidity. Flavors of earthy plum and raisin are echoed by vanilla and spare oak on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Raspberry and milk chocolate aromas are simple and come across a bit like plastic. The wine is narrow on the palate, with herbal plum flavors, while the finish is short and doesn't elevate things. Even at $9 this is regular in overall quality.",Spain,Garnacha
"Earthy aromas and mild funk infiltrate the bouquet, rendering it a step below pure and fresh. The palate on this wine is tight, with acidity poking through to lend crispness to red plum and berry flavors. Tangy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Peppery raspberry aromas are sassy and prickly. The palate holds its own but is modest overall, while flavors of medicinal red fruits carry an herbal streak. This is quiet on the finish, almost to the point of muteness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The aromas here suggest something artificial, either candle wax or air freshener combined with red fruits. The palate has a narrow feel with ample acidity and a light body for Ribera del Duero. Flavors run in the direction of stewed plum, while the finish feels rough and tastes a bit raisiny.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dry plum and cherry aromas seem hard and capped. The palate feels scratchy, with chunky berry flavors and a tough black-pepper finish. This is really basic in flavors and composition.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromatically, this blend of Macabeo, Muscat and Chardonnay gets off to a decent start by showing honeysuckle, lemon verbena and minerality. But in the mouth it's sharp and narrow, with blazing acids that turn peach and nectarine flavors towards sour. Simply put, there's not enough body here for the wine to rate higher.",Spain,White Blend
"Fresh on the nose, with red cherry and apple skin aromas. This feels rather sharp and acidic, with flavors of tart cherry pie and red plum.",Spain,Garnacha
"A touch of vinegar and volatility sits atop the nose, but there's fruit and weight under the surface. It feels tannic and slightly sour, with sharp acidity pushing zesty flavors of tomato, red cherry, red plum and herbs. Tasted twice with inconsistent results; this note reflects both wines that were tried.",Spain,Mencía
"Tan in color, this has fleshy, almondy aromas. It feels flat and creamy, with soft, lightly oxidized flavors of mealy apple and walnut oil. This is past its prime.",Spain,Verdejo
"A soupy sort of wine with raisiny aromas. It tastes salty and feels astringent, with tomato, herb and brothy flavors. The mouthfeel is the best part.",Spain,Syrah
"This is gritty, burnt and stalky smelling. On the palate it's sour and underdeveloped as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"This smells of latex and cinnamon. On the palate it's light and lean, with dilute flavors of cherry pie and unusual Middle Eastern spice. Grating and acidic on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Burnt and gritty smelling, with rubbery, meaty berry aromas that turn candied and herbal with airing. This feels hollow, with roasted, stalky flavors and buttery young oak. It's grabby on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"This starts with aromas of cinnamon, hard candy and weedy red fruits. It feels sugary and broken, with candied strawberry flavors in front of a sweet, confected finish.",Spain,Syrah-Grenache
"Murky and stewy smelling, with no vitality and overt green accents. It's a bit heavy in feel, with salsa-like flavors of tomato, tomatillo, chili pepper and herbs.",Spain,Garnacha
"This smells like compost. It feels hard and clacky, with sharp acidity and weedy, minty flavors that finish rough and green.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is light and dusty upfront, with solid cherry and raspberry aromas. Smooth, silky and somewhat creamy in feel, it features a mixture of fresh tomato, plum and spice flavors. Snappy and perfectly clean, with light to medium intensity. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Creamy oak along with toast, vanilla and mocha are the lead aromas on this grabby, tight Rioja that hits with clampy tannins. Flavors of dried raspberry, red plum and tomato lead to an herbal-tasting, high-toned finish that's juicy and a bit hot and scouring.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Radiator dust, strawberry, cherry and apple-skin aromas amount to a slightly flat but not offensive nose. Likewise in the mouth: it's good and pleasant but a bit flat. Flavors of plum, berry and brine define the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Earthy plum and berry aromas dominate a fruit-forward bouquet. A layered, proper feeling palate delivers lightly buttered flavors of dark plum, creamy oak and spice. On the finish, this tastes a little toasty and peppery, while the feel is comported.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Full blackberry and black-plum flavors come across lush but soft. That impression is confirmed in the mouth, where things feel short on acidity and thus kind of flat and mushy. Blueberry and dark plum are the lead flavors, while the low-pulse finish feels heavy.",Spain,Mencía
"Red plum and raspberry aromas come with a distinct whiff of stalks and stems. Big, grabby tannins control the mouthfeel, while baked flavors of herbal fruits finish with mossy notes and additional herbal overtones. This wine has its good points but it's undeniably scratchy and stemmy.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This 10-year-old wine from a hot vintage is soft and plump but has gaps in its fiber. The mouth is tannic around the edges but lacks stuffing, while flavors of plum and berry run jammy and heavy. A hollow finish with prune flavors and dry tannins is the final act.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Scratchy, herbal aromas settle on tar, asphalt, tart red fruits and leather. The palate on this cutting Rioja is pushy and full of bold acidity, while oak and herbal berry flavors finish minty and spicy, with a ringing, acid-driven feel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mild white-fruit and pickled aromas are O.K. but don't amount to a whole lot. This is a spritzy wine with tang and acidity, and citrusy pineapple, lemon and lime flavors. This shows a slight vegetal side, especially on the finish, where asparagus and pole-bean notes appear.",Spain,Hondarrabi Zuri
"Nectarine and orange peel are the lead aromas on this everyday, entirely serviceable Cava. A fresh, juicy, citrusy mouthfeel creates a nest for citrus flavors, grapefruit and orange in particular, to do their thing before finishing slightly bitter and pithy. This is made mostly from Trepat grapes.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Despite being fairly young, this is a weighty wine with a gold color and waxy apple aromas. A blocky mouthfeel is oily and has enough acidity to stay lively. Flavors of chunky apple, peach and melon lead to a round, oily feeling finish.",Spain,Hondarrabi Zuri
"Citrus fruits and rind are the lead aromas on this minerally Verdejo. Passion fruit, nectarine, orange and saline flavors finish with pithy grapefruit and almond-skin flavors. Overall this is tangy and holds firm. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"Fresh berry and plum aromas come with earth and herbal accents, which only boost the bouquet's complexity. The palate on this blend of Carignan, Garnacha and Syrah is structured and tight, with earthy, lightly toasted flavors of black cherry and plum. Spice, cocoa and oaky dryness define the finish. Drink through 2016.",Spain,Red Blend
"Apple and mild spice aromas kick off this simple white from the land of red Garnacha. The palate is fresh and juicy but light on character, while the flavor profile offers pithy, easygoing apple and melon flavors. This defines quaffable white wine.",Spain,Viura
"This wine is quite roasted on the nose, with spice and barebecue aromas dominating any fruit that might want to escape. The palate has a hard, tannic, rubbery outlook and flavors of mint, barbecued meat, baked berry and plum. It remains roasted and savory tasting on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mild and minerally on the nose, with nothing really standing out or dominating. The palate feels citrusy but sort of bland and basic, with mealy apple and melony flavors. This is a midlevel wine without much distinguishing character.",Spain,Chardonnay
"There's something likable about this aged, Sherry-style Rioja. Don't let the maderized tint turn you off; the wine has character, including rancio, toffee and saline aromas and flavors. If you like Sherry, give this a shot.",Spain,White Blend
"This blend of Viura, Malvasia and Tempranillo Blanco smells a bit sweaty and like passion fruit. The palate has a fresh, citrusy feel and flavors of lime and grapefruit. It's fresh and clean but dilute on the close.",Spain,Viura
"For $9, one can be satisfied with the value, but this wine does smell a bit sour and herbal, while the feel is angular and acidic. In the mouth, flavors match suit: punchy red fruits with an herbal twinge.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Gold in color, this Cava displays a distinct aroma of arugula or lettuce along with cream soda. It's foamy and soft on the palate, with a mix of bitter, toasty flavors as well as baked apple. Yeasty tasting yet bitter on the finish. Tasted twice; this reflects the better of two samples.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Opens with earth, lemon peel and lightly baked plum aromas. Feels easy and plump, with a good mouthfeel and proper acidity. Shows creamy oak flavors along with rooty berry, toast and milk chocolate. Turns more spicy and dusty on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"After an aromatic opening that includes wet leather, rubber and brine, this wine finds its stride, and while it's firmly tannic, the flavors of dark fruits, tomato, herbs, tobacco and cured meats do the trick. It gets better the longer it sits; drink now but give it as much air as possible.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"This everyday Tempranillo opens with mildly burnt and stalky aromas, but there's enough fresh plum and berry on the nose to keep things positive. The mouthfeel is wiry and alert, while plum and raspberry flavors finish short.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard-packed plum and berry aromas come with an oaky, meaty component that's manifested in the mouth via oaky flavors and a resiny feel. Flavors of wood and dark berries end with herbal notes and a minty character. As a whole this is dark and muscular but a touch green.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Berry aromas with a hint of pine and juniper form the opening on this fresh-style Rioja. A quick wash of red plum and raspberry flavors comes with an herbal leaning and minty notes. This finishes firm but light in weight, with a minty aftertaste.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Gasssy, soda-like aromas are the greeting, however there are decent red-fruit scents in the backdrop. This is a bit sticky and foamy on the tongue, with loud nectarine and cherry flavors. A sweet, basic finish with tolerable burn and abrasiveness is the final act.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Hard red-fruit aromas of cherry and plum mixed with campfire and mint open this choppy red. On the palate, scouring acidity pokes through, creating plum and raspberry flavors along with wood and bacon notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Here's a rich and oaky Ribera del Duero that pours on the bacon, hickory and earth aromas in addition to black fruit and licorice notes. It feels huge and tannic but still well balanced, with bacon, clove and baked black-fruit flavors. It holds onto its barbecued character, ending with a fiery finish. Drink now–2016.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is an ideal summer white. It's light but crisp on the bouquet, with whispy pear, apple and citrus aromas. Freshness reigns on the palate despite there being pulpy citrus flavors. Another wave of citrus carries the clear finish to a precise ending. Delicious white wine.",Spain,Albariño
"Like many Griñon wines, this is dense and earthy on the nose, with ripe berry and marzipan aromas. A round, layered, full-bodied palate shows hard, unresolved tannins and ripe, earthy flavors of blackberry, spice, herbs and chocolate. A firm, textured finish with integrated flavors is bullish but classy. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is a very nice aged Rioja with baked, earthy aromas of spice along with dried raspberry and plum. The mouthfeel is clean and solid in a normal, easy way, while flavors of plum and berry fruits carry notes of coconut and vanilla. A mild, warm, lightly baked finish cements this wine's status. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Forget the high price on this Tempranillo Blanco. Looking at the wine alone, it's briny and stalky on the nose, with wiry lemon-like acids that push sour orange flavors. Overall it's monotone, briny and citrusy.",Spain,Tempranillo Blanco
"This wine is creamy, lactic and jammy on the nose, with flat, earthy, baked berry aromas. It's grabby and sort of gummy and soft feeling, with lactic strawberry and plum flavors that set up a creamy, sticky finish.",Spain,Grenache Blend
"This is herbal and tomatoey on the nose, then racy in feel, with little midlevel stuffing on the palate. Flavors of raspberry are dilute and offset by mild buttery oak notes. This wine shows some elements of classic Spain but weaknesses as well.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Maderized in color, this wine has a yeasty, creamy nose with baked white-fruit aromas and caramel. It's OK in feel, with pickled, mildly briny flavors of apple and apricot. The finish is showing some oxidization, leading to a chunky, fleshy feel.",Spain,Tempranillo Blanco
"The nose on this Viura is flat, with walnut oil and dusty apple notes. The mouthfeel is solid, while the flavors suggest dry apricot, apple and nutty notes. This is dry and modest on the finish.",Spain,Viura
"This blend of 70% Viura with Verdejo and Sauvigon Blanc smells a lot like Bartlett pear juice. In the mouth, it's fleshy and dilute, with briny grapefruit and a pithy tasting finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Dusty cherry and plum aromas are nothing special. The palate is similarly just OK, with stalky flavors of citrus and red fruits. This is lightly oxidized and pithy tasting on the finish.",Spain,Rosé
"This is a prickly, slightly raspy wine with a lean, grabby feel and briny, pickled flavors of herbal red-berry fruits. It's resiny tasting on the finish, with a snappy feel and lasting herbal flavors.",Spain,Garnacha
"This 50-50 blend of Garnacha and Tempranillo has a green, ashy sway to the nose. The palate runs sharp, with pointed acidity leading to a mix of basic acid-washed plum and cherry flavors that are ultimately defined by a green, herbal undercurrent.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"This Cava has a funky nose that's unusual. The palate is a bit flabby, with sweet banana and peachy flavors. There's not much to the finish and overall this comes across as overly simple and strained.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dark in color, with concentrated, jammy aromas of wild berry and plum. Offers a big body given that it's a $7 La Mancha varietal, with concentration, solid structure and full, mildly baked flavors of black fruits and baked fig. Short but stout on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light and a little scratchy on the bouquet, with leathery notes. Feels fresh and kind of light in weight, with basic but clean red-fruit flavors and a dash of peppery spice. Flows easily on the finish, with a bit of fire and heat.",Spain,Mencía
"Starts out odd and exotic, with blueberry and Middle Eastern spice aromas. Feels condensed and jammy, with full flavors of herbs, boysenberry and plum. Shows freshness along with simplicity, with finishing herbal notes of sage and tarragon. Contains 10% each Merlot and Cabernet.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"What makes this varietal Syrah score high is not that it's over the top, superlush or heavily oaked, but that it's balanced to a tee. Black cherry, blackberry and spice aromas are more solid than they are special, while the palate folds together flavors of baked fruit, berry, mocha and tobacco. It doesn't expand much on the finish, but by then the story has been told.",Spain,Syrah
"This is intense for Garnacha, with piercing berry, spice and heat to the bouquet. This is a big, burly type of modern Garnacha, with a streak of boosting acidity. Flavors of plum, berry and cherry finish long and slightly raisiny. Big and bruising but still well balanced.",Spain,Garnacha
"A bit earthy and horsey on the nose, this is nevertheless attractive on the bouquet, with sandalwood, spice and black fruit aromas. The mouthfeel registers as being thick and chewy, while the flavor profile includes toasty, chocolaty black-fruit flavors, with a finish that has weight and a vanilla note. Drink now–2016.",Spain,Mencía
"Wood grain, paint-like aromas and red-fruit scents carry the bouquet on this crisp, snappy, high-acid Rioja. Flavors of red currant, plum and pie cherry are followed by oaky, resiny notes of vanilla and leftover oak spice.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Albariño is a fragile style of white wine and some just don't age well. This is one of those wines; it's slightly past peak maturity, as evidenced by wheaty, yeasty aromas. The palate finishes with a hint of bitter citrus pith.",Spain,Albariño
"Aromas of chemical, plastic and milk chocolate are dominant and mask the wine's black-fruit content. The palate feels condensed and narrow, while woody, baked flavors of berry fruits finish resiny and chocolaty.",Spain,Tempranillo
"After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate. Flavors of herbal red plum and rhubarb conclude with tight, edgy acids and a bit of burn and heat. This is fresh and generally pretty good, but it lacks Toro's usual richness and power.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Given the difficulties of this cool vintage, this is an excellent wine with dark berry, herb, spice and vanilla aromas. It's firm on the palate like most 2008s, with flavors of blackberry, chocolate and oak spice leading to an earthy tasting finish. Drink now–2016.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Teso la Monja picked a good vintage to introduce this entry-level Toro. Romanico is big and candied on the nose, with floral berry aromas, milk chocolate and a touch of raisin. On the palate, spunky berry fruit flavors blend with juniper notes, while the finish delivers herbal leftovers, a pinch more juniper and commendable length and smoothness.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This has a lot of good things going in its favor, for example depth, power and richness. It's also raisiny and oaky, with stewy core flavors of baked berry, cassis, roasted meat and vanilla. The finish is chewy and thick, with vanilla and pastry flavors along with grating tannins. By no means is this wine perfect, but it offers a lot of what's good about Toro; drink now.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Gritty, piercing aromas of herbal, leafy red fruits do little to set this wine on course. In the mouth, it's high-toned and acidic, and thus the flavors are tart, choppy and short.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Grassy on the nose, then foamy and abrasive on the tongue, with a mix of oxidized flavors, bitter citrus and grassy accents. It finishes pithy tasting and citrusy.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Scratchy, candied aromas of red fruits get things off to a rough start. The wine is acidic in feel, with tart, herbal red-fruit flavors. And it finishes pickled, with an herbal sharpness.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is one unusual wine. It's a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with Tempranillo and Garnacha, but it smells like a root-based perfume mixed with herbs and tobacco. It's over the hill in feel and green and herbal in flavor, with a raisiny aftertaste.",Spain,Red Blend
"Oxidized citrus aromas are flabby, as is the palate. Flavors of apple and peach are basic, while the finish feels dull and dried out, with no kick or lasting flavor other than mild bitterness.",Spain,Albariño
"Peach and melon aromas come with accents of vanilla and honey. The palate on this Garancha Blanca is chunky, without much acidic cut. Flavors of grapefruit and orange are flabby, pithy and dull, while bitterness controls the finish.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"A big step down from the past two vintages. This Verdejo lacks fortitude and clarity; it's grassy and flat on the nose, then cloying on the palate. Flavors of bland citrus are disjointed and underwhelming. Finishes grassy and green.",Spain,Verdejo
"This wine is raisiny on the front end, heavy and prune-driven in the middle, and even more raisiny on the finish. Overripe in style with 60% Garnacha and 40% Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Seems as though this medium-sweet Viura-Malvasia blend has gotten better in recent years as the winery has dialed down the sweetness and weight. Lately, this vintage included, Satinela has been fresh, cleanly made and easygoing, with sweet pear and peach flavors and not too much weight or residual sugar. Captures the essence of medium sweet.",Spain,White Blend
"Solid on the opening, with red fruit aromas and a mild stalkiness. Feels healthy and medium in weight, with mild oak, fresh plum and berry, and a touch of cocoa for flavors. Dry and crisp on the finish, with leftover oak flavor and good balance.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Melon, pear, apple and mild sulfuric aromas lead to a palate with an acidic center. Apple, lime and pith flavors are what you get. This tastes and smells good; it's also bubbly and aggressive in feel.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This wine is fresh as can be, with loads of friendly black-fruit aromas upfront. The palate is juicy and bright, not the least bit hard or tannic, with huge flavors of berry fruits, baking spices, chocolate and even some bacon. This delivers a lot for the price.",Spain,Garnacha
"Tarry blackberry and plum aromas are good and lusty. This is a round, medium-bodied blend of Garnacha, Carignan and Syrah that's ripe but not overpowering. Flavors of berry and plum are red in nature and finish with spicy notes and a good feel.",Spain,Red Blend
"For Toro, this is earthy and slightly herbal as opposed to ripe and jammy. Aromas of mulch, leather and herbal berry lead into a firm, rocky palate with rooty flavors of burnt leaves, black fruits and oregano. A tight, compact finish with moderate flavors is a bit closed and hard.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
This basic wine opens with earthy red-berry aromas. The palate offers choppiness and green-leaning flavors of berry and tea. The finish is scratchy and hollow. An OK Garnacha on its best day.,Spain,Garnacha
"Maderized aromas of applesauce and dust are not terribly welcoming. Meanwhile, the palate is mild and tastes nutty, like soft apples and spice. This is acceptable barrel-fermented Viura but it lacks freshness and character.",Spain,Viura
"Pazo Señorans generally makes great wine, but this aged Albariño is past its prime. The nose is soft and smells mostly of toffee and vanilla, while the wine has a maderized tint and stalky, geriatric flavors of bland apple and oxidized citrus. This wine should have been drunk five years ago.",Spain,Albariño
"This is a just-acceptable wine with latex, roasted berry and plastic-like aromas. It's heavy in the mouth, with jumbled, roasted flavors of rubbery fruit and forced oak.",Spain,Garnacha
"Odd aromas of talcum powder and bath oils are fragrant but not very wine-like. This is flat on the palate, with very little cut and oily tasting flavors of ripe white fruits.",Spain,Viura
"Pasty, chemical aromas do little to draw you in. The palate on this everyday Rioja is scratchy, while flavors of tart fruit with rubbery, pasty overtones fail to elevate the wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is one raw, choppy, strained Tempranillo. The nose is sweaty and severely herbal, with stalky smelling red-fruit aromas. It's hard on the palate, with burnt, green-leaning pie cherry flavors, and the finish is bitter.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This Viura smells waxy and oxidized for a 2011. The palate feels chunky and awkward, while the flavor profile deals maderized pear and apple.",Spain,Viura
"After earning a number of Best Buys prior to this vintage, this $7 white blend is disappointing. The nose is strange and funky, while the palate feels hollow, with briny apple and pickled citrus flavors. 50% each Airen and Macabeo.",Spain,White Blend
"Animal cracker aromas are sweet and the fruit on the nose is mealy on this Viura-Chardonnay blend. The palate is also deficient in that it's watery in feel, but there's some tangy lemon to the flavor profile.",Spain,White Blend
"This white Garnacha is strange smelling, with a mix of cream soda, pickled fruit and vanilla aromas. It's tart, briny and citrusy on the palate, with a sour finish.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Opaque in color, with blackberry and licorice aromas but also a distinct streak of brambly herbs and green. Later on, pine needle and tartness enter the fray. This is a commendable modern Rioja but it does have a few issues, namely a green herbal component.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There aren't many rosé Cavas that stand out, but this is one of the few. It's bready and yeasty on the bouquet, with caramel and baked fruit aromas. It feels slightly creamy and complex, with peach, nectarine and dry spice flavors. Long, elegant and mildly peppered on the finish. Made from the Trepat grape.",Spain,Trepat
"You had better love big, burly, meaty reds if you're going to dig this Syrah, which is ultraripe and lush. The raisiny aroma is almost heavy, while the palate is big but not excessively so. Baked, ripe flavors of black fruit and chocolaty oak lead to a short, ox-like finish. Drink now–2015.",Spain,Syrah
"Earthy and deep smelling, this Mencía is full, layered and nicely textured on the palate. As for flavors, look for equal parts dark fruit, toast, smoke and herb. Things dry out and fade on the finish.",Spain,Mencía
"This basic Navarran Tempranillo smacks hard with acidity and jumpy fruit, leaving tangy flavors of red plum and raspberry. A short, medium-intensity finish is more crisp and fresh than detailed.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe berry aromas are tinged with rubbery, gaseous notes on this Tempranillo blend. The palate is chunky, blocky and low on acid, which results in a jammy wine with a hint of saltiness on the back palate. Clove flavors define the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With aromas of wood, mint and generic dark fruits, this opens in good form. In the mouth, this is fresh and medium in body, with a mix of herb, oak and red-fruit flavors. A mild finish feels slightly dilute but easygoing.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The packaging on this Verdejo is attractive, but the wine is relatively neutral on the nose, with hints of white-fruit scents. The palate has modest depth and tang, with flavors of lime, mango, grapefruit and a hint of bitterness.",Spain,Verdejo
"This mature wine is rusty in color and burnt and stalky smelling, with gritty fruit aromas. In the mouth, it's flabby and lacks structure, while the flavor profile is earthy, with herbal berry flavors. Carob and herbal notes are the finishing flavors.",Spain,Red Blend
"Tropical fruit aromas give this Verdejo a punchbowl bouquet that includes lychee and kiwi. The palate is melony and round in feel, with flavors of mango, honeydew and green banana. On the finish, this feels flat and not that vital. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"Boysenberry and blueberry aromas mixed with oak scents amount to an inviting, solid bouquet. In the mouth, this is healthy, full-bodied and showing plenty of kick. Flavors of berry fruits, plum and roasted notes end with jammy berry flavors and a good texture. Drink now–2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Exotic blueberry and fir tree aromas set up a jammy palate with soft tannins and flavors of blackberry, dark cherry, toast and a hint of burnt beef. Widespread tannins cause the finish to feel mellow and not that pointed. This is a very good Spanish wine that's not too complex. Drink through 2018.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"With a hint of rubber and asphalt, the bouquet on this value wine is generous and topped with blackberry and dark plum aromas. The palate is grabby, with clampy tannins and black-fruit flavors mixed with chocolate and spice. The earthy, lightly herbal finish with rubbery nuances is nice.",Spain,Garnacha
"Light peach, apricot and buttercup aromas are better at first but lose steam with airing. This Xarello is lemony, racy and gives off plenty of kick on the palate, while flavors of citrus and melon are equally creamy and zesty. This holds firm on the finish, with brightness offset by a creamy texture.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"This is jammy and reduced throughout, especially on the nose, which offers a dense blueberry aroma. Saturated and solid on the palate, it features ripe flavors of black plum, blackberry and caramel. A potent, fruity, modern type of Tempranillo that's long on fruit and short on complexity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard, rubbery, leathery aromas are balanced off by black-fruit scents. This is tight on the palate, with condensed flavors of berry, plum and minty herbs. The finish holds onto that herbal character while showing solidity and adequate structure.",Spain,Tempranillo
Apple aromas open to a fleshy palate with tropical flavors of melon and mango mixed with powdered sugar. The wheaty tasting finish is round and soft.,Spain,Viura
"Orange, apricot and honeysuckle aromas are simple and good. A solid, melony feeling palate has just enough acid to stay upright. Flavors of passion fruit, cider and briny citrus manage to stave off bitterness on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Raisin, dust and red-apple aromas come across soft and jammy. The palate follows that lead: it's flat and grabby, with density and mild acidity. Raisin and rubbery flavors turn slightly bitter on the finish, which shows rubbery tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is a clean, fresh style of Garnacha with floral black cherry aromas offset by a minty note. The palate has a zingy feel and crisp, fresh plum, raspberry and dry herb flavors. As a whole it's focused and uncomplicated; this is very good Garnacha from one of the Valencia region's better producers.",Spain,Garnacha
"This big, dark, rubbery smelling Ribera wine is rugged and pushy, with mild volatility on the nose along with a whiff of spent coffee grinds. A clampy, bullish palate with rock-hard tannins sets up rubbery black-fruit flavors in front of a rough and tumble finish. Overall this is very good but hard and tannic. Hold for a year then drink through 2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of leather, dried cherry, vanilla and leafy earthiness get this gran reserva moving. In the mouth, it's a touch choppy and wiry, with leafy, roasted flavors of savory plum and spice. This is shy on the finish, with a hint of spice and chocolate. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The tough conditions of the 2008 vintage are reflected in this scratchy wine. Plum is the key fruit aroma, and that's followed by a tight, firm body with toasty oak, black fruit flavors, herbal notes and peppery spice. Quick and a touch hot on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Smells full but reduced, with a foxy, candied leaning and aromas of vitamins and minerals. Feels big, bulky, grabby and thick, with baked blackberry and plum flavors. Full on the finish, with some heat.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Feels sturdy and properly acidic, with melon, papaya and apple flavors running alongside almondy bitterness. Simple and quick on the finish; 60% Xarel-lo and 40% Chardonnay.",Spain,White Blend
"This is a throwback wine with complex aromas, intriguing flavors and a light-to-medium body. The blend is Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, and the end product offers cinnamon, orange peel and tea aromas in front of an acid-rich palate, with spiced cranberry, dried fruit and citrus flavors. Elegant and feminine in style; drink now–2018. Fewer than 2,400 bottles produced.",Spain,Red Blend
"Raisin and kirsch aromas are soft and rich, settling on strawberry and spice notes. The palate is lifted by firm acidity and solid tannins, while the wine's core flavors of raspberry, plum and herb serve it well. It finishes warm and sweet tasting, with licorice and molasses flavors that are tempered by a baking spice note.",Spain,Garnacha
"Under control on the bouquet, this has pear and apple aromas. The wine feels round, juicy and pure, with oak, toast, lemon, apple and spice flavors. Barrel influence creates a peppery, dry and spicy finish, and overall this blend of Viura and Malvasia is on the money. Drink now.",Spain,White Blend
"This is not a success given past performances of Pie Franco. The nose lacks Verdejo's characteristic citrusy punch, showing instead, notes of haystack and mealy apples. A plump, soft palate delivers pithy, peachy flavors of papaya and lees, while a bland, green-tasting finish doesn't fully come to the rescue.",Spain,Verdejo
"Candied plum and cherry aromas are bright, jumpy and youthful. The mouthfeel on this red Rueda, something you don't normally see much of, is narrow, pinched and grabby. Edgy flavors of plum, herbal berry and mild oak set up a finish with a minty green accent.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Apple skin and red-plum aromas are herb-infused and suggest tomato sauce and carrot juice. A full, almost sticky feeling palate deals plum, cherry and tomato flavors along with notes of oregano and tarragon. A finish with red-licorice flavors and tomato notes is the final salvo on this blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% Chardonnay.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This modest Rioja opens with herbal, minty aromas of raspberry, cherry and cheese. It's not much of a scale tipper, and that's backed up by lightweight flavors of cracked pepper and cherry. A hint of heat comes up on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean, fully loaded blackberry and dark plum aromas are smooth and subtle. In the mouth, this Tempranillo is chunky and solidly built, with earthy, roasted flavors of berry and plum. Savory, meaty flavors define the finish on  this dark-leaning, affordable Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mild and floral on the bouquet, this has touches of citrus and gritty cherry. The palate feels fresh, lively and healthy, with a baked, spicy flavor along with a briary berry note. Solid but mild on the finish; drink now–2015.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is more than admirable for a 100,000-case, widely available Albariño. Apple, lime and mineral aromas set up a cutting, citrus-driven palate, with crisp, narrow flavors of lemon and green apple. A touch pithy on the finish, which is long and minerally.",Spain,Albariño
"This wine is the epitome of traditional Rioja Reserva. It opens with aromas of citrus peel, tobacco, earth, cherry, smoke and rubber. Fresh and medium in body, it has oak-based flavors of vanilla and spice on top of reedy red fruit. Oak persists on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"One of Rioja's best wines is quite fine, but not nearly as deep and expressive as it has shown in top vintages. The nose offers earth and subtle spice along with black fruit, while the palate is deep and smooth, with blackberry, mocha, cinnamon and nutmeg flavors. Medium-long on the finish. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A tough, sun-belted wine with concentration, big tannins and a ton of power and flavor. The nose is all bacon, balsamic notes, tobacco and roasted black fruit, while the ridged palate is dark and tastes of blackberry, molasses, coconut and brown sugar. Edgy, lemony and tannic on the finish. Drink now with beef; can be held for another 3–5 years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lemon and lime aromas are suggestive of Sprite, while the body on this high-end Cava is fresh and snappy, with sizzling acidity. The flavors come across crisp and focused, emphasizing apple and dry spice. The finish is long, spicy and textured, with nothing rough or scouring.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Baked, earthy and leathery, just like all the AN wines. But there's also a smooth intersection of the old and new worlds here; it's one part rooty, oaky and rich but also dry, leathery and indigenous to the Balearics (the base grape is Callet). Finishes a little sweet and warm, and thus it's begging to be drunk now.",Spain,Red Blend
"A more traditional type of crianza with vanilla, spice, dry berry fruit and a quiet, subtle approach. The mouthfeel is Old World with it's clean, dusty weight and proper acid-tannin balance, and the flavors of spice, cherry, dried currant and earth don't overstep their place. Very nice wine for under $20.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice, clean and vibrant, with a welcoming set of peach, apricot and citrusy aromas. The wine is 100% correct and fresh, with clarity and flavors of apple, peach and green grapes. Shows just enough body, acid and pith on the finish, but drink now before it starts to fade.",Spain,Albariño
"Textbook Albariño from what's shaping up into one of Galicia's best years in a long time. This wine is elegant and lightly creamy, with flower blossom and citrus aromas preceding apple, peach and nectarine flavors that are straight from the farm stand. A pure and exemplary wine given that 30,000 cases were made.",Spain,Albariño
"Dark, oaky and smoky for a value wine, this has leather and blackberry aromas. It feels full, chewy and substantive, with dark berry, molasses and mocha notes. Smooth and dense on the finish, with leftover blackberry, coffee and chocolate touches.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dill, vanilla, tobacco, earth and light red-fruit aromas comprise the classic nose. The palate feels tight and in good shape, while a mild berry flavor comes topped with touches of cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg, expressing Rioja in every way. Elegant and balanced; drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is earthy, cool and foresty on the bouquet, with a coconut note that accents the wine's deep berry aromas. It feels smooth and nicely balanced, with modest tannins and toasty, oaky flavors of spiced blackberry and licorice. Smooth and subtle on the finish, this is ripe, stylish and ready to drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Interesting and very much showing Navarran qualities, including aromas of black olive, herbs and mossy fruit. The palate has good structure, balance and feel, and thus there's a nice platform for dry black cherry, cassis and mocha flavors. As an '05 it's evolved, still fresh enough, and ready to go.",Spain,Red Blend
"Crisp, clean and minerally on the nose, with apple and green-fruit aromas. It has a round, smooth feel and flavors of peach, apple and citrus that will enliven the palate and aid almost any seafood, vegetable or salad. A natural wine with just enough powdery sweetness to raise a smile.",Spain,Albariño
"Very solid and sturdy, with aromas of apple, lemon-lime, soda cracker and mineral. The palate is fuller and more flavorful than your average cava, with candied apple, papaya, lime and lemon flavors. Dry, pithy and hinting at complexity on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A different breed of blended wine, with earthy aromas of dried cheese, leather, dill and vanilla. The palate is tight and mildly tannic, with sweet cola, roasted berry and earthy tobacco flavors. Not your normal bulky, dark wine; it's complex and based on 85% Garnacha and Carignan.",Spain,Red Blend
"This wine is quiet on the nose, with light touches of toasty resin and butter. It's Burgundian in feel, with plump, fleshy fruit that accompanies resiny, spicy flavors of white fruit and citrus. Notes of wood and resin dominate the finish on this chunky, full-bodied Viura (with 8% Malvasia).",Spain,White Blend
"This Tempranillo plays outside its price league, with spicy, compact aromas of prune and char. The mouthfeel is full and ripe, while flavors of blackberry, baking spice and pepper set up a generous, solid finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dense, cool and masculine on the nose, this has aromas of prune, cola, tobacco, cheese and leather. It feels silky and soft, showing maximum ripeness and excellent balance. It tastes of ripe berry, stewed plum, spice and tobacco. Complex and classy on the finish; drink now–2017.",Spain,Red Blend
"Starts out rustic and leathery, with hints of smoke, leafiness and earth along with baked berry and spice. This four-grape wine has good density and mouthfeel that frames leather, earth and slightly baked berry fruit flavors. Finishes chocolaty and sweet, with just enough acidity to maintain balance.",Spain,Red Blend
"A delicious wine and very much the model for value in Spanish Garnacha. That this has 25% Tempranillo only seems to make it better; the nose is sweet but full and plummy. The palate is pure, flavorful and sweet, with baked cherry, earthiness and a hint of chocolate. A wine to buy in quantity, i.e. by the case.",Spain,Red Blend
"Sappy green apple, grapefruit and citrus aromas are welcoming and pure, while the palate is soft-edged, citrusy and full or tangerine and melon flavors. A good, honest, clean Verdejo that has sure-fire mass appeal. More solid than special, which is what you should want from this kind of wine.",Spain,Verdejo
"Nutty and toasty, with toffee and butter pecan aromas. The palate is wet, light, alert and snappy, but also angular and citrusy. The acidity here is key; it pushes dried apricot and tangy flavors toward a nutty finish, and overall the wine delivers what a good, higher-end palo cortado should.",Spain,Palomino
"Fragrant, clean and tropical, with slate-driven minerality. The palate is just fleshy enough but mostly it's tight and crisp, with flavors of green apple, fresh green herbs and a drip of honey. Holds it together from front to back; just right for salads and seafood-based tapas.",Spain,Godello
"This is very light in color, with lightweight aromas of peach and citrus. It feels crisp and angular, with fine acidity that creates supreme freshness on the tongue. Flavors of peach and nectarine are spunky, ending like the toot of a whistle.",Spain,Rosé
"What a beauty this is. Strong-boned apple, green melon and minerally aromas are the greeting. The palate is pure and right, with piercing pineapple, lime and mild briney notes. Lasting and true late, with quality oozing up from the glass.",Spain,Verdejo
"This opens with pure, attractive nectarine and apricot aromas, along with hints of mineral and petrol. It feels pure and racy, with delicious, clean flavors of pineapple, honey and mango. It's delicate and fresh on the finish, with just enough weight to be taken seriously.",Spain,Moscatel
"This gets going with apple, peach and mineral aromas that are pure and alluring. It feels lifted but a little creamy, with green banana, lime, orange and kiwi flavors. Solid and long on the finish; this is exemplary unoaked Verdejo.",Spain,Verdejo
"Opaque to the eye, this has a bouquet that's tightly sealed with aromas of oak, tobacco and cola, and a baked, minty note. Saturated but not syrupy, this has roasted, savory flavors of clove, nutmeg, hickory and baked blackberry. It remains roasted, deep and delicious on the finish. This is entirely modern, full bodied and excellent as a whole.",Spain,Red Blend
"Floral fruit aromas suggest blueberry, but overall this vintage lacks the power and depth that Termes and its big brothers are known for. Airing sets up sweet, easygoing berry flavors and full tannins, but in the middle it's less whole than it has been in other years. A juicy, well-made wine that should not be judged as weak just because 2007 was a marginal vintage. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Opens with cherry aromas and brightness, then the palate fans out and fattens up with juicy plum and cherry flavors along with just a touch of medicinality. Toasty, warm and tasty, with a thoroughness not usually found in $8 wines. Garnacha at 70% with 30% Syrah.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"Very smooth with youthful, juicy, fragrant berry aromas along with a bouncy palate full of sweet cherry and cassis flavors. Clean, snappy, alert and healthy. More simple and straightforward than complex, but worth the money and then some.",Spain,Garnacha
"Yellow in color, with a waxy nose that's baked, rich, a bit stalky but also honeyed. The palate is round, hefty and thick, with full melon and peach flavors in front of a plump, woody finish. Good as you're likely to find among Spanish Chardonnay.",Spain,Chardonnay
"This is an exotic and unusual wine, with mint, dry spice and mild red-fruit aromas. Light in body, it has snappy, juicy acids pushing raspberry and red plum flavors. For Old World fans, this is the ticket; it's lean and tangy, with leather and vanilla notes on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This smells toasted and heady, with a baked apple aroma. The mouthfeel is full, while the flavors tend toward citrus and pith. Solid on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Smoky, meaty and attractive from the start, with vanilla, tobacco, plum, berry and herbal notes on the nose. Rich, layered and fairly tannic in the mouth, with flavors of tobacco, coconut, sweet berry and cassis. Long, stylish and nice on the finish; a well-oaked blend of 50% Tempranillo, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot.",Spain,Red Blend
"Well-applied oak is the greeting; it's mildly lemony and minty. Tight and focused on the palate, with cherry and plum flavors and tannic structure. Turns a touch herbal in the midpalate due to 50% Cabernet in the blend, but the Garnacha and Carignan half keep it in the right lane. Tasty and stylish, with regional style.",Spain,Red Blend
"Big and forward on the bouquet, this has loud, fiery black-cherry and berry aromas. Like most Lurton wines of Spanish origin, El Albar is chewy and ripe, with a syrupy feel and flavors of blackberry, stewed plum and spice cake. The finish is chocolaty, beefy and concentrated.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Minerally as well as lemony and zesty on the nose, this is nevertheless neither pushy nor intense. The palate offers good acidity and razor-sharp clarity, along with flavors of pineapple and apple. Alert on the finish, this is a firm refresher.",Spain,Albariño
"An opening of apricot and peach aromas is proper, while the palate delivers a jolt of zest and acidity to more pineapple, lime and punchy green-apple flavors. Tangy later on, with more than a drop of lemon and lime to the finish. Also slightly pithy and bitter, which is natural for Godello.",Spain,Godello
"Minerality and crispness define the bouquet, which brings green apple and citrus aromas. There's punch and spritz on the palate as well as sweet citrus and juicy lime flavors that break up a little as they fan out. Not sure if there's residual sugar, but the wine tastes a bit sweet.",Spain,Albariño
"Shy at first, with standard raspberry aromas, earth and buttery notes along with cherry and raspberry flavors. Becomes fuller and more satisfying with time, and once it's fully open you have a solid, satisfying Rioja with true flavors and good overall balance.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little leesy on the nose, but mostly it's forward and lemony. The palate is citric and crisp as a whistle, with lemon, green apple and a secondary sweetness akin to pineapple. Focused and clean on the finish; chiseled and defined.",Spain,Albariño
"Maple syrup and gritty raisin aromas turn smoother and more open with air. The palate is layered and structured, with raisin, cherry, pepper and licorice flavors. Long, warm and satisfying on the finish, with classic Rioja vanilla notes. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A single-vineyard Garnacha that's ripe and sultry. There's earth and oak on the mineral-tinged nose and then smooth flavors of blackberry, baked plum and spice. Feels soft and mature for Garnacha, and therein lies the secret of Montsant: The better wines (like this one) have a pleasant, friendly quality to them.",Spain,Garnacha
"Reticent caramel and walnut aromas come with a peach scent. It feels nice as it glides across the palate, with nervy, salty flavors of dried apricots and nuts. Toffee and peanut are the lead flavors on the classy finish. Only 300 cases were produced.",Spain,Palomino
"This is lush smelling but dry at the same time, with touches of caramel and cola gracing the bouquet. It feels tight and pinched, but precise, with dried citrus, toffee and hazelnut flavors. The finish is briney, complex and very long. Only 300 cases were made.",Spain,Palomino
"Opens with a load of sweet, candied black-fruit aromas but this wine excels on the nose because it's composed and precise for being so young and simple in scope. Velvety, rich black-cherry flavors run the show, and the finish brings length and an herbal shading. Very nice for a wine from Toro at this price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Comes out of the chute with some aggression, but that's settled by quality apple and grassy aromas. The palate is jumpy and lively, with pleasant, slightly sweet apple and peach flavors. Shows good refinement, ample layering of flavors and a spot of minerality. As a whole, this is good cava.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice. And the flavors are friendly and suggest black fruits and smoke. A little more oaky and charred than some, but a nice crianza nonetheless.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty lemon and cidery aromas are solid and draw you in. The palate has a fresh, clean feel and lively, tangy flavors of citrus, green fruits and green herbs. Zesty, a bit lemony, and nice on the finish. Not a complicated bubbly by any means.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dark and fully oaked Rioja with vanilla, mocha, char and black-fruit aromas. The body is good while the acidity is a bit high, and thus the flavors lean toward tart black cherry and zesty wild blackberry all with a robust amount of toast, spice and charred darkness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Soft and fleshy smelling, with a raisiny aroma, this feels wide, grabby and choppy, with rich, sweet flavors of molasses, raisin, licorice and tobacco. It finishes forward, with some heat, and overall the wine is lusty but seems a touch  overripe. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Full, yeasty and dry on the nose, this has rustic, lightly baked red-fruit aromas. It feels round and easygoing, with dry nectarine and melon flavors that lead nicely onto the subtle, fruity, fresh finish, with spice flavors and lasting acidity.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Roasted and bullish, this has a rustic, smoky bouquet of earthy plum and savory berry. It is both plump and racy on the palate, with thick berry flavors that are touched up by bacon, spice and cocoa. It has a youthful mouthfeel that may calm down in a year or two. Drink now–2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Roasted and still robust 10 years after harvest, with aromas of grilled meat, fall leaves, tobacco and herbs. It's round on the palate, with heat and slightly herbal and roasted core flavors surrounded by berry and pepper. A mature and interesting single-vineyard Cabernet from northeast Spain.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smoky, minty and spicy on the nose, with plenty of dark fruit and lavish oak. The palate, like the entire wine, is integrated and balanced. Tobacco, herb, molasses and toasty oak flavors blend well with ripe, foresty berry notes. Hard and tannic, but expressive, fruity and clean for a wine that's based mostly on Cabernet Franc.",Spain,Red Blend
"Berry fruit, spice, earth, tea and leather aromas give this off-vintage wine ample complexity on the bouquet. The palate is layered and stout, with smoky black fruit flavors accented by chocolate and pepper. Toasty and stylish on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This kitchen sink Tempranillo blend brings heavy leather, mint, spice, cola and black fruit aromas that are really nice as a whole. It's weighty and deep in the mouth, with blackberry, vanilla and coconutty flavors. Grabby, ripe, tannic and modern all the way through the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Smooth and lightly roasted on the bouquet, this has tobacco, cola, fine oak and earthy berry aromas. It feels generous but a little soft and syrupy, with raisin, licorice and savory baked-fruit flavors. The finish is long and continues to be savory tasting. Drink now–2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Charred and smoky on first take, this has plenty of upfront oak that adds a toasty quality to the core plum and berry aromas. It feels full, round and pure, with dark, slightly balsamic-like flavors of baked berry and earth. It's smooth, mild and unobtrusive on the finish. Drink now–2016.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Brickish in color, with mature aromas of cedar, pine, tobacco, olive and dried fruits. There's still some racy acidity that's keeping the rooty flavors of tobacco, dried berry, coffee and spice moving forward. Finishes dry and a little bit classic; drink now for an affordable taste of Navarra.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins. There's nothing not to like about this Albariño, which is pure, pithy on the finish, and more than solid in a pedestrian, familiar sort of way.",Spain,Albariño
"Smooth on the nose, with a pinch of rubber, earth, smoked beef and plum/prune. The palate offers structure, solid acidity, zestiness and bright flavors of cherry and raspberry. Finishes crisp and tight, with lingering vanilla. A nice wine for tapas and other meat-based dishes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"While I prefer the 2009 for its clarity and freshness, this '08 is no slouching tiger. The nose delivers still-fresh apple and mineral aromas, while the flavor profile leans toward gooseberry, lemon and green melon. Shows some pithy bitterness on the finish, so drink right away or seek out the '09.",Spain,Godello
"Mineral, lime and crisp apple aromas give it a precise, pure nose. And that same character exists on the palate and finish, where white peach, green banana and melon flavors are full and forward. Shows good concentration and quality for a large-production bubbly at this price.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Subtle and minerally on the nose, this has bashful white-fruit aromas that are at the peak of freshness. It feels good, lively and complete, while flavors of apple, citrus and mineral are well balanced. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"A much better wine than in previous years, this opens with berry and vanilla aromas that lead to a full, vigorous yet choppy-feeling palate, with roasted berry, hickory and vanilla flavors. More woody than fruity as a whole, with hard tannins on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Apple and melon aromas are pure and minerally. The palate is round and offers good density and acidic balance along with tasty, better-than-normal melon, papaya and apple flavors. Creamy but balanced on the finish; meets or beats any reasonable expectation for fine Albariño.",Spain,Albariño
"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance. Powerful acidity pushes it in the right direction, and the finish of lychee, passion fruit and nectarine is lasting. Very nice wine but relatively high in price.",Spain,Albariño
"Stylistically, this is at odds with what I feel Albariño should be. That said, it's a well-executed and well-made barrel-fermented white with full-force toast and popcorn aromas followed by a resiny, vanilla-fueled flavor profile that folds in apple, banana and creamy frosting. Still vital and healthy after three years in bottle.",Spain,Albariño
"For Navarran Merlot-Cab, Inurrieta Norte is always a winner. This vintage has good darkness along with smooth aromas of black fruit, earth, rubber and spice. It's a bit acidic and shrill as a tasting wine but will do fine at the table. The mouth is spunky and shows slightly herbal raspberry and plum flavors. Finishes light and easy.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"For a rosado cava, this offers nice fruit, balance and complexity. The nose is pure cherry and raspberry, but in subdued doses. Meanwhile, it's zesty, foamy and fresh in the mouth, with nectarine, plum, strawberry and prickle. Perfectly nice for everyday quaffing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Wild berry, cherry and mint notes are what you'll find on this wine's open, likable bouquet. The feel is clean and crisp, with snappy wild-berry and plum flavors that crackle with finishing acidity and controlled tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fresh, clean nectarine and cantaloupe aromas provide an inviting entrance, which is followed by a vital palate that has mild orange and nectarine flavors which are slightly sweet and friendly. Smooth, light and not at all aggressive on the finish.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"The bouquet on this Cava is a bit gaseous, with mild lime and apple aromas. In the mouth, it's foamy but fresh and lifted. Flavors of candied apple and mango finish in sweet fashion. Nice for Cava but with limits.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Simply delicious white wine with lip-smacking freshness, bright peach and apple flavors, and clarity from front to back. It's a little leesy but a lot more crisp and oceanic, with a well-cut body and mild citrus undertones throughout.",Spain,Albariño
"Crisp, lemony aromas are pure as a sea breeze. The palate is just as pure and fresh, with ripe apple, citrus, pineapple and stone fruit flavors all mixing well. Elegant and crisp, with just the right finishing weight and length.",Spain,Albariño
"More traditional than modern in style, this has aromas of citrus, herb, dry oak and medium-weight fruit. It feels crisp and tightly focused, with a complex palate that offers notes of berries, chocolate and herbs. It finishes long, with a leathery, meaty element that lends gravitas to the wine. Drink now–2016.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Concentrated and rich up front, this has black fruit aromas of prune, blackberry and cassis, with notes of beef and herb. It feels full bodied, filling all corners of the palate. Flavors of black cherry, plum and black currant are ripe, while jammy characteristics of fruit cake and prune work the mellow finish. A blend of 60% Tempranillo, 30% Cabernet and 10% Merlot.",Spain,Red Blend
"After a waxy opening, the bouquet unveils honey and peach aromas that are totally inviting. It feels thick but not cloying, and the honeyed flavors of banana, peach and dulce de leche are a prelude to the creamy, thick and deeply layered finish. Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Albariño make the blend.",Spain,White Blend
"Aromas of cherry and leather come with burnt earth and smoke, but overall the nose is inviting. The palate is solid in feel, with good weight and drive that supports a smoky flavor profile of red berries and controlled bitterness. Finishes toasty, with a lick of bitter chocolate.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A perfectly solid Garnacha with pepper, bright red fruit and a touch of country style to the bouquet despite its pedestrian price. The palate is bright and tastes of plum and red berry, while the feel is good and the finish fruity and lively. What inexpensive red wine should be.",Spain,Garnacha
"Spunky and mildly abrasive on the nose, this has some punch and character. It feels fresh, lean and narrow, with a traditional Rioja mix of herb-influenced red-fruit and dry spice notes. The mild finish offers tobacco and raspberry flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy on the nose, this blend features hints of spearmint, leather, toast and light berry. It feels  lean and quick as lightning, with flashy acids. Flavors of dry berry, tobacco and earth accompany vanilla and butter twists. The finish is fresh and old school.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Simple, mild aromas of pear and apple form a good opening. This feels plump and nice in the mouth, with applesauce and pithy orange flavors. Zesty, alert and fresh on the finish. A nice, quaffable white made from Xarel-lo, a grape most often used for sparkling wines.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"A sensuous sweet Sherry, this has the full monty of fig, date, licorice, root beer and chocolate aromas and flavors. It's naturally thick and sweet but also balanced, so it doesn't come across like a spoonful of syrup. Great as a dessert wine with cake or blue cheese, but also as a topping for vanilla or coffee ice cream.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Elegant and elevated, this shows fine integration of fruit and oak on the nose. It feels creamy, with barrel toast, dry spice and melon flavors. It is firm, healthy and structured on the finish courtesy of barrel fermentation and aging. A Burgundian facsimile from Rueda.",Spain,Verdejo
"Clear and focused, with raspberry and edgy spice aromas to the nose. The palate doesn't bring a whole bunch of meat or heft, but it is clean, racy and food-friendly. Flavors of red berries and pepper are normal and expected, while the finish is dry and lean.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lime, citrus and other pungent aromas get it off to a good start, while the palate is wet and fresh, with clean, familiar grapefruit, lime and nectarine flavors. Lighter and less concentrated than Naia, but still a very good Verdejo for the price.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dry and subtle on the nose, with cherry and plum fruit scents mixed with balsam wood. The palate is tight, simple and offers a bit of creaminess to go with raspberry and oak-based vanilla and mocha. Light on the finish and fresh, with a medium body.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Timid but clean as a whistle on the nose, with apple and vanilla aromas along with a sprinkling of talcum powder. The palate is lively and fresh, with flavors of pineapple, lemon and other tropical hints. Entirely pedestrian as cava goes, but 100% clean and refreshing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dry and peppery to start, with muted berry fruit aromas along with wood shavings. The palate is snappy, clean and juicy, with raspberry, vanilla and tobacco-like flavors. More basic than special, with a steady, light-framed finish. More than functional; likely good with food.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This small-production Cava from Muga in Rioja is elegant, lemony and tight as a drum. Aromas of apple, lime and yeast set up an acidic palate with modest lemon and apple flavors and a linear, focused feel. Finishes with zest and kick.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"La Mano smells dry and spicy, with modest but present oak aromas and vanilla-tinged plum and berry scents. It's angular in feel, but the flavors of oak-based black fruit and raspberry work. It finishes mild, with some oaky residue.",Spain,Mencía
"Dusty apple and white peach aromas are basic and clean. The palate offers bright acids, citrus-driven fruit and whacks of oak-based cinnamon and resin, along with laser-like lemon notes. Mild on the finish, with flavors of vanilla and oak spice.",Spain,White Blend
"This is ultraripe and a bit raisiny on the nose, but there are encouraging flashes of schisty minerality and freshness. It feels jammy, full bodied and thick, with a baked black-fruit flavor and notes of licorice and tobacco. Smooth and earthy on the finish, with power to spare. Drink now–2014.",Spain,Red Blend
"The bouquet is robust, with bold aromas of berry, tobacco, root and tree bark. It feels flush, full and balanced, with licorice and blackberry flavors that are backed by nice acidity. This is a grabby and meaty blend of 80% Syrah, 10% Merlot and 10% Graciano.",Spain,Red Blend
"This vintage rosado is as good as always, but a bit lower on the quality ladder than previous years. The color is light pink and soft on the eye, while the nose suggests brick dust and orange peel. Smooth and easygoing, with sweet, generic flavors of orange and berry.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Normally this producer's high-end Sherries are outstanding, but this Amontillado is aggressive and hard, with a clod-like character that starts with molasses on the nose and then turns toward sharpness and bitterness on the palate. Try as I might, this one strikes me as good but loud, hard, forceful and lacking the suavity that great Sherries possess.",Spain,Sherry
"This is your quintessential simple quaff among brut cavas. It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors. It's slightly sweet and tropical, but still it holds onto its crisp qualities and dryness. No complaints for the money.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Slightly low on kick and bubbles for a blanc de blancs, but the wine's mix of green herb, apple, green banana and melon flavors is good and offers the proper set up to a finish that's citrusy as can be and only slightly pithy. Seems a touch flat or it might have rated even higher.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dusty, slightly candied aromas are briary and pretty good, and overall it's giving freshness, pop and red-fruit flavors touched up by dill, nutmeg and vanilla. Clean and lively on the finish, and more than competent as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts out with roasted, stewy, beefy aromas and not much brightness. The palate is measured and healthy, with dry raspberry, currant and medicinal plum flavors. It shows oak, earth, leather, acidity and some burn. In a nutshell, it's a good, standard, respectable Rioja that will complement almost any food.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A heavy, slightly strained wine that has a lot in tow. The nose is smoky, rubbery like an inner tube, and a bit herbal. In the mouth, it's a wide load with sweet, sugary, baked flavors of blackberry, prune, fig and chocolate. Very much on the ripe side, with a full tannic bite.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Initially it's rugged, but airing reveals black-cherry aromas and dry spice. The palate is crisp and a little sheer by itself, but the call here is that with food it'll be a winner. Flavors of red fruits are dry and collected, while the finish blends in coffee, spice and a touch of herbal Navarran panache.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Good on the nose, with solid raspberry and nectarine aromas. The palate is spunky and alert, with juicy red-cherry, rhubarb and integrated spice flavors. It's mostly a clean, basic, easy-to-drink bubbly, but it's persistent, harmonious and commendable. Pinot Noir with Trepat is the grape mix.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of apple cider and mild spice get it going in a good direction, and this colorfully packaged cava does pretty well in the mouth, where the texture is on the soft side and the flavors of apple and orange run a bit sweet. Not complex but good, fluffy and yeasty.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Friendly aromas of blueberry, boysenberry, pastry and vanilla are clean and welcoming. This is pure, racy and fresh in style, with a bright plum flavor. An honest wine with quality fruit and balance.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rioja-based Marqués de Cáceres' first foray into Albariño is a success. This wine is light, salinic and melony on the nose. The palate is complete and offers fine acidity with brine, pineapple and green apple flavors. Good and lightly pithy on the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"One of the best deals in Spanish red wine you're likely to find. Protocolo has always delivered value but this vintage sets a new high standard for $7 Tempranillo. It's deep, ripe and minty on the nose, with berry power foretelling a pure, lush palate that's packed with berry flavors and light herbal shadings. Impressive and super tasty, especially given the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice as always, this has notes of angel food cake, orange blossom and peach on the bouquet. It feels smooth and shows elegance, delivering minerally peach and citrus flavors. It holds form on the finish, which locks in on the wine's peach and citrus character.",Spain,Albariño
"A touch raisiny and sweet from nose to tail, but what's in between is convincing for Jumilla. Aromas of licorice and herbs are sweet but nice, while the flavors or raisin and blackberry are chunky, with a basic finish that's a little flat but definitely ripe. A blend of Monastrell, Cabernet, Tempranillo and Merlot that's ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"For Spanish Chardonnay, this is perfectly good and clean. The nose brings your basic set of white-fruit, mineral and fresh herb flavors, while the palate is lively despite some dry, resiny oak flavor. Even with banana, vanilla and creamy flavors, the wine is decidedly not cloying.",Spain,Chardonnay
"This winery is known for red Mencía, but this small-lot Godello is perfectly nice and drinkable. It has a neutral nose and a fresh palate of green melon, nectarine and apple flavors. The finish is clipped and a touch bitter, but there's no denying its tangy, forward approach. Only 250 cases made.",Spain,Godello
"Dusty earth and dry spice aromas blend with some char, vanilla and berry/cherry on the nose. The palate shows average density and depth, with lighter flavors of strawberry, raspberry, herbs, tobacco and vanilla. Finishes dry and peppery, with some toast.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Wheat, lemon-lime and grass aromas accompany touches of yeast and scrambled egg. This is a citrusy Cava, with acidic crispness and scour in support of green apple and orange flavors. Juicy and citric, with just enough weight to register this as being better than most.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"From the Sardon de Duero region that borders Ribera del Duero, this wine is big, minty and raisiny on the nose, with chocolate and leather aromas. It feels grabby and saturated, with prune, raisin and licorice notes that end in a bowl of prune purée. Very chunky and full bodied, this is a blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet and Syrah.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This wine smells baked and rasiny, and the bouquet brings charcoal and toast notes into play. It feels mature and ready, with raisin, molasses, chocolate and rooty berry flavors. Ripe and ready on the finish. The blend is Garnacha, Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Citrus, passion fruit and lime are draped all over the quality bouquet. The palate is juicy and offers a mild spritzy feel, while the palate is sweet and easy but maintains its necessary core citrus and mineral qualities. Finishes mild, smooth and a little sweet.",Spain,Verdejo
"Smoky and dry for starters, then crisp in the mouth, with bright red fruit flavors of cherry and plum. Picks up oak, heat and sweetness on the finish, but overall this is exactly the type of flavor-packed red wine most people want. Grenache with 15% Syrah.",Spain,Garnacha
"Smoky and secure on the nose, with dry oak, spice and lighter aromas of red plum and raspberry. The palate is juicy, firm and dry, with snappy flavors of spiced plum and red cherry. Finishes buttery and creamy, but with tightness and adequate length.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean, crisp, cut, this has a minerally white-fruit nose. It's elegant and chiseled on the palate, with bright peach and nectarine flavors that carry onto a tight, dry, flinty finish. An elegant, lifted Albariño with a lightness of being.",Spain,Albariño
"This is jammy, ripe and raisiny smelling, then round, full, slightly choppy and tannic on the palate. Ample oak lends coconut and vanilla elements that support the blackberry flavor. Creamy and fairly oaky on the finish.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"The blackberry, boysenberry and cinnamon aromas are exotic and attractive. It offers a ton of body in support of concentrated flavors of black fruit, fudge and spice. The finish is long, with notes of chocolate, pepper and some elegance.",Spain,Monastrell
"With a nose of toffee, dried apricot, cocoa powder and rancio, this is classic off-dry amontillado. It feels fresh and active, then tastes rich and moderately sweet, with flavors of hazelnut, caramel, toasted banana, orange and spice. Nutty and smooth on the finish.",Spain,Sherry
"Golden-brown in color, this has heady aromas of cola, nut, nutmeg, root beer and caramel. It feels full, slightly rich and properly cut, with coffee, toffee, chocolate and honey flavors. A balanced but elevated dessert-style Sherry that gets it right.",Spain,Sherry
"Clean and minerally, with stony aromas along with banana and pineapple. The palate is tight, clean and balanced, with flavors of green banana, papaya and apple. Finishes pithy and with a touch of fresh-grated white pepper. A good but common type of unoaked Chardonnay.",Spain,Chardonnay
"A clean, fresh, appealing sort of Tempranillo with cola, earth, black cherry and berry aromas followed by a bright, forward, spicy cherry palate. Honest, snappy, healthy and juicy; nice and solid for La Mancha.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Simple, nice and not trying too hard; this basic brut is graced with nice apple and citrus aromas. The palate is wet, juicy and classic, with crisp apple, green herb and melon flavors. Round, clean and just crisp enough.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish. For under $15 this is good, casual Albariño that won't steer you wrong.",Spain,Albariño
"This Rioja-based winery's first effort with Albariño is perfectly good, with aromas of peach and fleshy melon. The palate is tangy and linear in feel, with citrus and green fruit flavors. Turns sharp and citric on the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Spicy and rubbery at first, with aromas of bacon and earthy berry fruit. Staunch across the tongue, with cola, carob and cassis flavors. Becomes leaner and more racy as it finishes, with rooty, herbal flavors. 50% Tempranillo with 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pure peach, pear and oceanic aromas properly reflect the wine's name, which stems from a popular beach in nearby Barcelona. In the mouth, it's tangy and linear, with crisp, citrusy acids and corresponding flavors of lime and green apple. Finishes tight and dry.",Spain,Garnacha Blanca
"Minty, pointy oak aromas jump out at you, followed by pepper, leather, spice and herbal berry scents. Tight and structured in the mouth, with black plum and ripe berry flavors. Turns oaky and hot on the finish, with vanilla and pepper flavors. A little fiery but the real deal for Calatayud.",Spain,Garnacha
"This smells of baked black fruit, coconut, vanilla and char, with a palate that's ultrasaturated and almost cloying. The compact flavors are of concentrated blackberry liqueur and cassis, which narrow to berry and oak notes on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is soft and lush on the nose, with a slightly lacquer-like scent. The palate feels thick but nicely acidic, keeping it on an even keel. Flavors of honey, apricot and preserved papaya set up a fleshy, plump finish that brings it all home. A blend of 70% Sauvignon Blanc and 30% Chardonnay.",Spain,White Blend
"Fresh and full of lime on the nose, and overall this is simple, smooth and gives you little reason to worry or fuss. The palate is smooth, creamy and a little low on acids, thus the lemon-lime and melon flavors have a fullness that's sweet and good.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Sweet and a little grassy on the nose, with lemon-lime aromas. The palate has a solid, regular, friendly feel along with sweet flavors of white nectarine, apple juice and tarragon. Perfectly quaffable, dry in feel despite being semisweet, and balanced. For the price, what's not to like? Imported",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"An apple cider aroma comes across dusty, slightly maderized and heavy. This is a plump, wide Albariño with pithy citrus and white nectarine flavors. The finish features pithy, fleshy accents. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"This is a textbook example of a mineral-driven wine, with lemon and apple aromas along with touches of hay and corn. It feels fresh, citrusy and tight, with citrus flavors leading to a pithy, tangy finish. Crisp and cleansing.",Spain,Albariño
"This Rioja opens with a jumpy, lively, candied red-fruit aroma. It feels solid, rubbery and stout, with dark fruit flavors that are accented by mild resin and butter notes. Feels a little sticky on the finish, with firm tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ripe and stocky upfront, this features raisin, jammy berry and spice aromas. It feels blocky, full and rubbery on the palate, with plum, blackberry and herb flavors that lose steam and turn more raisiny toward the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Fresh berry aromas are simple and attractive. This wine is pretty good in feel and structure, with roundness and tannic bite. Flavors of wild berry, plum and cherry turn dark on the back palate, with tightness and dark flavors defining the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smooth and pure up front, this has notes of lemon peel and tobacco on the bouquet. Fresh, complete and racy in feel, it has flavors of tomato, cherry and raspberry, with an overall freshness that can't be assailed. It finishes mild, with a hint of toffee. Elegant and ready to drink now–2015.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Mossy, earthy and damp smelling, this has roasted plum and berry aromas that suggest savory things to come. It feels rich, with good acidity and a thick overall texture. Saucy plum, berry, tomato and herb flavors finish with barbecue, vanilla and tobacco accents. This is a blend of Monastrell, Syrah and Tempranillo, with 500 cases produced.",Spain,Red Blend
"For a 2010, this is holding form. It smells mature but fresh, with plenty of sea influence and white fruit aromas. It feels nice, lifted and lively, with lemon, citrus and green apple flavors. A pinch of pithy bitterness infiltrates the finish, but overall this is a fine Albariño to drink very soon.",Spain,Albariño
"A neutral cava with white candy and mango on the nose. The palate is both foamy and scouring, with soda cracker, apple and citrus pith creating the flavor profile and finish. Shows basic flavors, normal mouthfeel and scouring acidity.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Opens somewhat clipped and choppy, with citrusy aromas mixed with red fruits. The palate is healthy, lean and acidic, with bright plum and berry flavors softened by some creamy vanilla. A solid wine with punch, acidity and a good finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lucid and basically colorless, with flowery, lychee-like aromas that suggest Malvasia or Moscatel. But it's only Viura and Chardonnay, and it tastes fresh, floral and nice, with lime and lychee. About as easy as they come.",Spain,White Blend
"A bit unusual and confusing, but that's because it hails from the Rioja region. The nose is herbal and mustardy, with green aromas leading to a cidery palate of apples and spice. There's also a bit of lemon and creaminess to this cava. Hard to understand but not without its merits.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is fresh and clean upfront, but mild, with saline, mineral and melon aromas. It feels round and mellow, with tame acidity and waxy flavors of peach, melon and citrus. Dry on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Wobbly aromas of vanilla wafer and tropical fruit aren't fully convincing. The palate, however, crackles with a tangy lemon flavor, a vanilla infusion and a chalky- textured finish. Drink this blend of 70% Albariño and 15% each Treixadura and Loureira right away.",Spain,White Blend
"Punchy and citrusy on the nose, with passion fruit leading the way. It's balanced and round in the mouth, but good acids push green apple, green melon and peach flavors. Solid and true on the finish, with lasting citrus and mineral notes.",Spain,Verdejo
"Leafy and dry smelling, with exotic lavender and cumin aromas to go with brushy dried berry, pine and smoked meat. Feels good and healthy despite being eight years old, with tobacco, leafy red fruit and earthy, dry flavors. A little stalky, roasted and herbal but very nice. 60% Tempranillo, 25% Cabernet and 15% Merlot.",Spain,Red Blend
"Floral and fresh smelling, with rosy notes, blueberry and nary any funk, leather or earth. Vibrant and juicy in the mouth, with boysenberry and plum flavors that set up a fruity, clean finish. Brighter, smoother and easier going than the 2009.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is waxy on the nose, with the aromatic spunk of nettle and sweaty citrus. It feels fresh, minerally and zesty, with citrus, apple and green herb flavors. It's solid, smooth and elegant on the finish, which turns slightly bitter as it concludes.",Spain,Verdejo
"This is a little heavy and oily on the nose, with blowsy white-fruit aromas. It feels peachy and smooth, with key flavor components of melon, apple and pear. This shows some extra heft, ending with a subtle and smooth finish.",Spain,Albariño
"The quality of the 2009 vintage is reflected in this value-priced Toro that's full and medicinal but also balanced and rewarding. Flavors of medicinal red-berry fruit are mixed with thicker, chocolaty notes, while the finish is bold, grabby and solid. A blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Clean and approachable, with lemon-lime aromas leading to an easy, mildly crisp palate with lemon, lime and honeydew flavors. Sweet in accordance with standard extra dry guidelines, and also good for apéritifs and sparkling cocktails.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Apple, spearmint, mixed greens and citrus carry the bouquet to a firm palate with dry papaya, lemon and herb flavors. Finishes with apple, lemon and bitterness. Very basic and quaffable, but nothing extraordinary.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Although this is mild on the nose, almost to the point of neutrality, there's a speck of red fruit to be found with airing. It feels lively and a bit acidic, with juicy, jumpy flavors of red plum and cherry.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Wild berry, cola, raisin and spice aromas are good, but the palate is only average in feel for a Priorat, with a lean fruit content, snappy acidity and little cushion for the wine's plum, berry, tomato and herb flavors. This finishes long, minty and mildly herbal.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dusty cherry and raspberry aromas taste candied and friendly. The palate on this reddish-colored wine is round and plump, with good texture. It tastes sweet but clean, with flavors of strawberry, cherry and pepper on the finish. 80% Garnacha and 20% Graciano.",Spain,Rosé
"This is leathery and earthy up front, with cherry and berry aromas that come with a flower accent. It feels snappy, alert and slightly citrusy, with raspberry, red plum and vanilla flavors. It's relatively short and choppy on the finish, but it's fresh, with the proper amount of oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big, smoky and concentrated on the nose, this has a ton of black fruit and char notes. This is mouth-filling, deep and powerful stuff, with a potent mash of baked blackberry, molasses and barbecue sauce filling in the flavor profile. It finishes long and roasted, with savory oak and saucy spice flavors. A blend of 85% Garnacha and 15% Monastrell.",Spain,Garnacha-Monastrell
"A light, elegant berry aroma transitions to notes of plum and blackberry with airing. Smooth and nice in terms of mouthfeel, it has balsamic-touched flavors of lightly stewed berry, earth and chocolate. This is a proper Rioja for near-term drinking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy raspberry aromas are easygoing and come with a hint of tobacco. It feels grabby but good, with lots of spice, pepper, herb and dark fruit flavors on the palate. The finish is healthy and well lifted, with a light but fresh herbal accent.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This needs air to show its best, because at first it's tight, mulchy and nutty. Early on, it feels clampy and scratchy, but it becomes better as it airs. The black fruit flavors are touched up by notes of oak, dried cheese and leather—characteristics that extend onto the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earth, cherry, spice and leather aromas are subtle and do not overpower. The palate is kind of snappy and tangy, which may be due to 20% Graciano in the blend. Flavors of tomato, herbs and red berry are firm and perky, while the finish is dry and tight. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Apple and honeyed aromas are round and ripe. The palate is chunky and easy, but with good acidity. Flavors revolve around apple and peach, while the finish is linear and direct. Ripe and solid wine from a good vintage for Albariño.",Spain,Albariño
"Dense, deep aromas of grilled meat and berry fruits lead to a full and concentrated palate with structure and fierce tannins. Tastes of classic blackberry and plum, with light herbal shadings. Turns more spicy and interesting on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Begins murky, with baked red fruit and tomato aromas. The palate is tight and shows structure along with roasted, spicy, dry berry flavors that sweeten up towards the finish. Interesting despite being a bit baked out and rustic. 60% Merlot with 30% Tempranillo and 10% Cabernet.",Spain,Red Blend
"Sort of generic and oily on the nose, with white-fruit aromas that don't fully register. The palate is both spongy and spritzy, with dry, soft flavors of melon and papaya. More fluffy and lush than zesty and precise.",Spain,Verdejo
"Waxy on the nose, with buttercup, creamy yellow-fruit scents and white flowers. The palate is wet, racy and a touch like soda, with sweet, candied flavors of peach and melon. Plods along with good enough acidity to support the wine's core sweetness and candied qualities.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Starts with distinct, hard aromas of mustard, horseradish and jerky. In the mouth, it's full, bullish and tannic, with flavors of bacon, wood resin, smoke and stewed blackberry. Very smoky and dark, with hard tannins, and just not as good as past vintages.",Spain,Merlot
"Unusual in that this cava hails from the Ribera del Duero region, where red wines are 99.9% of the show. For a no-dosage nature, it's properly crisp and dry, almost like a liquid version of a soda cracker. There are some holes in the fabric but overall it's citrusy, tight and only mildly bitter on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Bold, forward and extracted red wine, with raspberry, earth, compost and a light leafiness to the nose. Tannic and tight, with plum and heavy, ripe berry flavors. Toasty and dark on the finish too, with power and freshness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This Navarran Garnacha is more interesting, offering lemony, floral aromas that are red in nature and not very stout. The palate sizzles with racy acidity, while the flavor profile is pure and tangy, with cranberry and red plum notes. A zesty style of Grenache.",Spain,Garnacha
"Compared to the excellent 2006, this wine is heavier, riper and jammier at every check point. The nose is baked and raisiny, while the palate feels saturated to the extreme and gritty as well. The primary flavors run toward baked plum and blackberry, while licorice, leather and raisin notes carry the finish. Give this lots of air after opening, about an hour or so.",Spain,Red Blend
"Attractive and fruity on the front end, this has pure berry aromas but not a lot of nuance or complexity. It narrows a bit on the palate, with tight tannins that support the black fruit and coffee flavors. Juicy, bright and solid on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big, black and alive in the glass, with earth and black fruit aromas. The mouth is lively and pure, with blackberry and red plum flavors covering both the dark and red fruit bases. Grabby and long on the finish; very likable value-priced Grenache.",Spain,Garnacha
"Heavy, dark, candied and jammy, with a hint of licorice to the nose. The palate is chunky and concentrated, with meaty berry flavors and a dose of chocolate. Short on the finish, yet fruity if a bit flat.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This wine is messy on the nose, where compost, gas and animal aromas blend with jammy berry scents. It feels tannic and clampy, with baked and rooty berry flavors. The wine remains roasted in style and rooty on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"This basic Tempranillo is violet in color and shows rubbery aromas of black fruit and wild berry. It feels skittish on the palate, with grapey flavors of plum and berry. Juicy, candied and a little warm on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"It's hard to avoid the wine's rooty, green aromas of bell pepper and spice, which fall in front of a thick, bullish, tannic palate with sweet, slightly baked berry and cassis flavors. Bulky on the finish, which deals bitter chocolate and herb flavors. 70% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% each Merlot and Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Melon and peach aromas are clean and attractive. The palate is round and creamy, with just enough acidic cut. Flavors of melon and peach carry onto the finish, which has thickness and smoothness. Easygoing for Albariño.",Spain,Albariño
"Delicate aromas of lime and lemon blossom are well cut and minerally. The palate is juicy, fresh and lively, with sweet melon and apple flavors. Stays melony and apple-driven on the finish, which ends a bit sweet.",Spain,Albariño
"Dark in color and dense on the nose, this has aromas of pastry, blackberry, jammy plum and even an exotic note. It feels chewy and solid, with a full-bodied texture and deep flavors of black cherry and prune. It comes up a bit short and clipped on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Grapey and citrusy on the nose, this has an herbal twinge. It feels bouncy and simple, with juicy boysenberry and blueberry flavors that set up a grapey, standard-feeling finish. Fresh, juicy and best for simple sipping.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Peach and citrus aromas are light, mellow and clean. This is fresh, lifted and slightly spritzy in feel, with citrus, lime, green melon and apple flavors that finish crisp and clean.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"The nose on this Albariño deals tropical fruit and vanilla scents. It feels citrusy, with modest flavors of papaya, peach and white melon. After showing moderate vitality on the palate, the finish softens up and slips into the netherworld. Seems as though it's beginning to fade.",Spain,Albariño
"Light on the nose, with dilute red-berry aromas and mild leathery, cheesy notes. The palate is kind of raw and lean, with tangy, crisp flavors of pie cherry and raspberry. Dry, peppery, snappy wine, with definitive crispness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pale and low on bead, but if you like a Moscato-style wine, this isn't bad at all. The palate is sweet, fleshy and smooth, with lychee and melon flavors. Lively but easy on the finish, with a final wave of lychee fruit and Malvasia-driven sweetness. Unusual but pretty good.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The apple and lime aromas are simple yet inviting. It feels round and mellow, maybe a bit low in acidity. The flavors of banana, vanilla bean and pear are friendly, while the finish is smooth and bears a tropical flavor.",Spain,Verdejo
"Berry candy and licorice aromas become more subtle and earthy with air. It feels grabby and abrasive as many Toro's are prone to be, with blackberry and root notes and a sugar beet flavor. The slightly hot, candied finish holds onto that rooty character.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This is ripe and raisiny on the nose, with marmalade, spice cake and ripe berry aromas. Oddly, this feels raw and abrasive, given the dark-leaning aromas. While it shows baked black-fruit flavors, it's tannic, sassy and snappy.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A bit stalky and corny smelling, this lacks the overall purity that can make Albariño great. It's fresh enough, but standard in feel, with simple melon and peach flavors. The finish lacks oomph, and combined with the nose, there are indicators that it's beginning to slip.",Spain,Albariño
"This wine starts with baked fruit and mustard aromas. The mouthfeel is pinched in the middle but syrupy and sticky as a whole, while the flavor profile deals notes of cured meat, bacon, resiny oak, ripe berry and baked cassis.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The nose deals rhubarb and green bean notes, and the palate is mildly astringent. The flavor profile offers a mix of sweet berry flavors like blueberry, and then mint and green herb notes surface. Licorice and heat can be found on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Flowery and easygoing on the bouquet, this is taught, lemony and wiry on the palate. Flavors of gooseberry, lime and apple feature cleansing acids and a persistent, citrusy tang. A blend of 80% Xarel-lo and 20% Riesling.",Spain,White Blend
"Floral, earthy, funky and barnyardy, with all the young exuberance that comes with joven/roble wines from RDD. Lots of color, power, tannins and extract along with young, sweet, chewy black-fruit flavors and tart acidity to the palate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hot earth, baked cherry and mild vanilla aromas come in front of a snappy, angular palate with tangy pie-cherry and red-plum flavors. Sheer and basic Rioja with high acidity, lean fruit, a cleansing finish and a light body.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells oily and a little burnt and acrid, with fleshy flavors of banana, melon and bitter pith. Has some verve but mostly it's an average wine with some bitterness and dry orange peel and pith. Decent but offers nothing beyond.",Spain,Verdejo
"Lively, candied and medicinal, with grassy aromas along with mild animal notes. The palate is young, grabby, forceful but solid, while the flavors are bright, bold, snappy and suggest red plum and black cherry. A basic young wine that's decent if you're not too discerning.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This vintage seems to have taken a step forward compared to past years. It's bright pink in color, with tight, salinic aromas of cherry and apple skins. Tastes tangy and crisp, with plum, nectarine and citrus flavors. Real good for the price.",Spain,Rosé
"Raisin and heavy plum aromas suggest full ripeness and even some overripeness. It feels chewy and textured, with serious concentration and baked flavors of dark berry and roasted plum. This tips the scale in terms of weight and ripeness, delivering a deep, roasted character that calls for near-term consumption",Spain,Garnacha
"Full, ripe and lusty, this has notes of licorice and grit on the bouquet. It feels fresh and lively, with enough richness and weight for balance. It tastes of balsamic-infused berry and spice, with an integrated herb note peeking through.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Early on it displays mild heat and jamminess, but with airing everything settles, and ultimately this old-vines Tempranillo from the lauded winemaker Mariano Garcia excels. The palate is rich, minerally and meaty, with slightly syrupy black fruit flavors, molasses and chocolate. Chewy, tannic and pure on the finish, with hints of herbs and lemon peel. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit flat and jammy on the nose, and then it runs hot and heavy across the palate, where the flavors waver between citric and plum-cherry. There's a lot of fruit here, but also some burn and finally a dull hum to the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Earthy but sharp on the nose, with a foreboding sense of stem and sourness. The palate is indeed raw and acidic, with lean, slightly stemmy flavors of herbs, raspberry and plum. Not bad but carries a stemmy, less-than-pure personality.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A rubbery, minty, jammy wine, with a mildly candied, gummy feel and sweet, modest, lightly green flavors that suggest red fruits. The finish is decent but herbal and sweet.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The opening aromas of reedy berries are gritty and crusty, while the palate is lively but feels snappy and raw. Flavors of cherry and plum are light, while the finish is straightforward, with a citrusy kick. Not as full and generous as past vintages.",Spain,Mencía
"Vanilla, popcorn and baked apple aromas create a good but one-dimensional nose. In the mouth, things run tight and acidic, with a puckering, lemony feel and austere flavors of dry apple and spice. Finishes tangy and lemony.",Spain,Viura
"This smells stalky and past its prime, but it's not stinky or maderized. The palate is fleshy in feel and oily in sensation, with bitter citrus flavors and pithy notes. Neither vital nor fresh on the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"This Garnacha is another from the Borsao operations, and it's clean with plenty of black fruit on the nose and palate. Juicy, tight, forward stuff with a dark and peppery finish. A little raw and pointy, so drink with salami, a burger or skirt steak.",Spain,Garnacha
"Rubbery and dark on the nose, with lots of black plum and cherry to ponder. The palate is firm and balanced, with round, rubbery, roasted plum and dark berry flavors. Full, nice and long enough on the finish to keep you involved.",Spain,Garnacha
"Shiny pink in color, with a crisp and wet nose that powerfully suggests refreshment to come. Juicy and superfresh on the palate, with cherry and raspberry flavors and citrusy undertones. A real winner in Garnacha rosé from Navarra.",Spain,Rosé
"Neutral smelling except for a touch of oiliness and tropical fruit. The palate is soft and melony, with sweet melon and papaya flavors. Round and pulpy on the finish, with a slight pithy bitterness at the very end.",Spain,Albariño
"Mineral, earth and graphite aromas give this rugged young Ribera complexity to go with racing berry fruit. The palate is a bit sharp and pounding, with boysenberry flavors coming with tannic bite and zest. Crude but fresh and clean, this wine should be smoother by the end of 2011 into 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Red berry and plum aromas form the base of this wine's fresh, uncomplicated bouquet. It feels juicy and bright, with good layering and aggressive flavors of berry and plum. The finish is dry and snappy, with mild oak and spice flavors.",Spain,Garnacha
"Jammy strawberry, crushed raspberry and mineral aromas define the bouquet. The palate is lifted by good acidity, while flavors of vanilla and tomato accent the raspberry and plum fruits. Fresh and subtle on the finish, this is a middleweight wine with a juicy disposition.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ripe and meaty, with bacon, earth, leather and inviting black fruit aromas. Not lazy at all; in fact a laser-like beam of acidity cuts through the palate, pushing bright, slightly fierce flavors of savory berry and minty oak. Finishes hot, spicy and with coffee and mocha. Cabernet-Monastrell to drink now through 2014.",Spain,Red Blend
"A bit tan and dull to the eye, with neutral aromas of apple cider and peach. The palate is wet, uncomplicated and simple, with basic apple flavors that some might consider to be bland. Solid on the finish, with papaya for flavor.",Spain,Viura-Chardonnay
"Spearmint chewing gum, cassis and raisin aromas are friendly. However, on the palate this wine rings hollow, with little structure and hardly any midpalate. The flavors of candied red fruits are basic, while the finish shows residual raspberry flavor and no complexity.",Spain,Red Blend
"Spiced apple and dried cheese aromas are simultaneously honest and slightly crude. This Cava feels fluffy, foamy and average in composition, with lime, pickled melon and brine flavors. It maintains the pickled character on the finish, which tastes slightly bitter.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is mildly herbal and dilute on the nose, but not unappealing. It feels medium in body, with a timid structure and simple red-berry flavors that taste slightly sweet. Fresh and mild as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"White fruit and flower aromas are friendly and simple. The palate feels soft and syrupy, and thus it's not surprising that the wine's flavors of sweet apple and pear taste honeyed and candied. Creamy on the finish, lacking the zest and cut that Verdejo should have.",Spain,Verdejo
"Hard berry and plum aromas turn minty and grassy with airing. It feels tough and tannic, but fresh, with mild herb-tinged flavors of red berry and red plum. Finishes lively but rough, with a mint note and grabby tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rough black-cherry and plum aromas are full and fruity. The palate is choppy, with prickly acidity leading to dry, hollow black-plum flavors. The wine shows color and size, with citrusy acid and astringency.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This perennial Best Buy is once again rock solid. Fresh berry fruit and compote aromas make for a good bouquet. There's no shortage of acidity, so the palate is jumpy and lively, with crisp, almost tart raspberry and plum flavors. Structured and forward; hamburgers and pizza wine par excellence.",Spain,Garnacha
"Broad and ripe on the nose, with sappy blackberry, plum and youthful aromas. The palate is big, full and tannic, with roasted plum and berry flavors in front of a smoky, hickory-driven finish. Chewy, blowsy and generous for $10 Tempranillo.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rooty and sweet smelling, with tobacco, burnt brown sugar and raisin aromas. The palate is thick, stacked and jammy, with raisin, tobacco and candied prune and cherry flavors. Very tasty and sweet but a little flat and old.",Spain,Red Blend
"This Cabernet-Monastrell blend tips the scales at 15.5% and asks you straight out: how big do you like your red wines? It is smoky, sultry and massive, with spicy boysenberry aromas, a deep, syrupy palate and plodding flavors of molasses, roasted berry, cedar plank and herbs. Bullish but drinkble now and over the next few years; probably not one for the cellar.",Spain,Red Blend
"If this Cava weren't so pickled in smell and taste, it would rate better. As is, it opens with white fruit, vanilla and brine aromas. Flavors of apple and pear maintain a prevalent, pickled edge, while the finish falls off in feel and clarity.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This has a jumpy and piquant bouquet, with notes of plum and raspberry. It feels pinched and narrow but lively, with mild berry, cherry and leather flavors. Holds onto that leathery characteristic on what amounts to a slightly bitter tasting finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pungent on the nose, this offers blasts of nettle, sweat, mineral and stone along with citrus. It feels fresh and forward, but the flavors of white fruit, jalapeño and bitter pith don't impress. Holds onto its bitterness on the finish.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"This blend of 60% Xarel-lo and 40% Chardonnay deals notes of petrol, yeast and powdered sugar on the bouquet. It's acidic and citric in feel, with lime, tart apple and other green-leaning flavors. Feels watery and tangy on the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Lychee, honeydew and cotton candy aromas precede the easy, not-too-serious- palate, which offers candied citrus, melon, pineapple and powdered sugar flavors. Clean on the finish and crafted for those who like sweet-tasting, simple wines.",Spain,Moscato
"Raisiny and jammy on the bouquet, this wine becomes vital in the mouth, with fresh acidity supporting the raspberry and red plum flavors. The raisiny resurfaces on the finish, with acidic bite.",Spain,Garnacha
"Starts out murky, gassy and challenged, and while it does emerge from that cloud it remains little more than bargain-priced, borderline Tempranillo from an obscure central Spain region. The palate shows generic, herbal black fruit and the finish is acceptable.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bright and shimmers with purple, while the nose is jumpy and candied, with a lot of sweetness and black fruit. Marginal to tough on the palate, with racy, hard tannins and a clacky feel to go with wild berry and mulchy flavors. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Generally speaking, most Amontillados are good at their worst, but for whatever reason this wine barely makes the grade. It lacks pop on the nose and seems dilute and drab. In the mouth, the flavors strike as sour and sharp, but also musty and weak. With so many fine Sherries available, this one seems like a laggard.",Spain,Palomino
"Strawberry and rhubarb aromas get it going, and frankly that's about as good as it gets. The mouthfeel is so-so. but the flavors are funky and mealy, with a weedy bitterness that doesn't serve the wine well. Lacks purity, focus and persistence. Made from Pinot Noir.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"A strange bird with herbaceous aromas that suggest sage or juniper baking in the summer sun. The palate is acidic and sharp, with green-tinged pie cherry and plum skin flavors. Gritty on the finish, with needling tannins and a final wave of that odd juniper character. 60% Monastell and 40% Petit Verdot.",Spain,Red Blend
"Clean and nice on the nose, with green fruit aromas and classic Verdejo prickle. The palate is bouncy and juicy, with lime, tangerine and passion fruit flavors. Fades quick on the finish but remains crisp and refreshing.",Spain,Verdejo
"Earthy tobacco and natural warmth provide for a good nose. It's briary smelling as well, with racy cherry and plum flavors. Shows some heat from 15% alcohol, but for $9 wine it packs a lot power and flavor. Unmistakable Garnacha that reflects sunny environs.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is light, mildly yeasty, slightly pickled and briny smelling. It feels fresh and edgy, with good acidic cut, while the flavors lean toward orange and white peach. It holds onto its briny character on the finish, which is dry, bracing and tastes of mineral and lime.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Harmonious on the bouquet, this has aromas of berry, marzipan and nutmeg. It feels a little acidic but that adds freshness to the package. The flavors of earthy, roasted fruits are a touch salty, and the finish tastes briney and baked, with notes of coffee and toast. A blend of 65% Tempranillo, 20% Merlot and 15% Caberent Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Black in color and dense on the nose, this has well-oaked aromas of black fruit, lemon peel and cedar. It feels full and fresh, with good acidity and prickly tannins. It tastes juicy and clean, with berry, black plum, vanilla, tobacco and spice flavors that carry through onto the finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"A heavy rush of black coffee is the key aroma, and with that comes notes of rustic barrel char and black fruit. It delivers a solid structure and a firm foundation, along with sticky tannins and oak-based resin. It tastes dark, with baked plum, tobacco and spice. This is creamy, charred and oaky from start to finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark as night and full of black fruit aromas, this old-vines newbie is rocking it. The nose is packed with jammy blackberry, leather and fine spice aromas, and the palate is pillowy despite big tannins. Smoky, swarthy flavors of blackberry, cassis and stewed black cherry roll, and it's chewy, creamy and chocolaty on the finish. Expensive but a high-quality contender.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Gold in color and short on bubbles, but heavy on sweetness and residual sugar. That said, it's an advertised semidry, so a certain level of cloy is expected. But this tips too far to the sweet side, leaving nothing but refined white sugar, banana and vanilla cream. Not my cup of tea.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Reddish in color and devoid of a visible bubble bead, this Garnacha-Monastrell cava is lacking in many ways. The nose is grassy and ashy, sort of like a spent cigar, and it's cheesy as well. In the mouth, it's fairly bland tasting, with generic, semitart flavors and a sharp finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A fairly unclean wine with leafy cough-drop aromas. The palate is weak and washed out, with stemmy red-fruit flavors. Spiced and leafy on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stemmy and raw smelling; similar in the mouth. The palate is narrow and sheer, while the flavors lean toward tart red cherry and rhubarb. Peppery and underwhelming.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This wine looks clear, with aromas of chewing gum, watermelon and cherry. The palate is regular and nebulous in feel, while flavors of melon and peach are slightly oxidized and pithy. A blend of 50% Tempranillo with 30% Garnacha and 20% Viura.",Spain,Rosé
"This small-production (200 cases), barrel-aged Xarel-lo is well made but fails to strike a chord. It's yellow in color, with oily aromas of petrol, orange peel and wood resin. It feels sticky despite its supporting acids, and it tastes primarily of wood and white pepper, with a lasting bitterness.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"This is light on the nose, with white fruit and citrus aromas. It feels lean, tangy and wayward, with tart flavors of tangerine and vanilla. Finishes bitter and pithy.",Spain,Sparkling Blend

"Gritty and raisiny up front, this has notes of tar and jammy blackberry. It feels resiny and tough, with carob, chocolate, baked berry and roasted plum flavors. The chocolate element persists on the finish, which is big, tannic and lasting.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is friendly on the nose with a melon scent. It feels fresh and not too challenging on palate, with nectarine, peach and mango flavors. The finish isn't too firm, but it doesn't fall apart. A simple, sweet casual quaffer.",Spain,Moscatel
"Toasty and elegant from the beginning. The nose breathes Christmas spice and mature berry fruits, while the palate deals a persistent structure and acidity for added spine. Tastes a little rooty and savory, with root beer and chocolate notes to the finish. Drink now or hold thru 2016.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy and rich Tempranillo with hints of fresh herbs, tomato, balsam wood and spice in addition to roasted plum on the bouquet. The palate is tannic and big but shows a ton of fruit and classy flavors of roasted berry, dark chocolate, licorice and dried spices. Heady on the finish and aggressive, but loaded with flavor, kick and quality. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is sharp on the nose, which indicates an unpromising future. The palate is tight and high in acidity, with sour plum and tart berry flavors. Short on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Off-pink in color, this has floral, perfumed aromas that suggest soap or bath gel. It feels like liquid candy on the palate and tastes sugary, like cotton candy.",Spain,Moscato
"This boasts a Christmas spice note on top of an earthy, baked berry aroma. It feels grabby, flat and gummy, with syrupy berry flavors along with a load of odd spices. As a whole, this is strangely oaked and doesn't show Garnacha in its best light.",Spain,Garnacha
This has an oxidized note on the nose. It has citrusy acidity and tastes like a mix of fino Sherry and peach.The finish is chalky in feel. Tasted twice.,Spain,Rosé
"Cherry and plum aromas are basic and candied, while the palate on this Prieto Picudo-based wine is perky and acidic. The flavors run dilute and herbal, with cherry pie and tart raspberry notes. Lingering acidity makes the finish both fresh and sharp.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"This Cabernet-Syrah blend has ripeness issues. It's fairly green and ashy in scent, and on the palate the tannins seem rather hard and underdeveloped. Flavors run toward herb-tinged black fruit and carob, while the finish is scratchy and a bit green in flavor.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"Smoky and meaty smelling to begin with, like a mix of barbecued spare ribs and roasted berries. The palate is full, tannic and drying, with bacon, hickory and baked blackberry flavors mixed with herbs. Hard and clacky on the finish, but flavorful and solid throughout.",Spain,Tempranillo

"Rusty in color, this has leathery aromas that include dried cheese and fallen leaf. Forward, fruity and full of acidity, it tastes of roasted black fruit, caramel and molasses. The fresh acidity ensures that it doesn't come across too forcefully or heavy. Cabernet and Merlot is the mix.",Spain,Red Blend
"A surprise and a true find in that this wine is excellent but priced well below its quality level. The nose is outright gorgeous; it's subtle, spicy, layered with dried fruit and folds in hints of tomato leaf and dill. The palate is expressive, delicate and offers smooth, leathery flavors. In a perfect state of evolution; drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Black fruits, brightness and a friendly sweetness are the aromatic greeting. The palate is intense and thick, with creamy, medicinal berry and molten plum flavors. A little aggressive and minty, but likable and ready to roll. 70% Monastrell with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend

"Briny, funky and light on the nose, this has a hint of cranberry. It feels crisp and juicy, but tastes sour, with acid-driven red-fruit flavors that are mixed with herbal, peppery accents. Very tight and modest on the finish. Prieto Picudo is the grape.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"This is about as strange and individual as Albariño gets. The nose oozes odd cinnamon and resin aromas, which are abnormal for the variety and the Rías Baixas region. A flavor of spiced apple finishes with the same spice character. Funky is probably the best word to describe this wine.",Spain,Albariño
"Almond candy and lacquer aromas create a corny scent on the nose. This wine feels flabby and soggy, with buttery oak and little to no fruit flavor. Finishes woody, with vanilla and spice. A blend of 60% Viura and 40% Chardonnay.",Spain,White Blend

Big and hot on the finish, with size but suspect balance. 67% Tempranillo and 33% Shiraz.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz

"This opens with a blast of diesel along with tarry asphalt. The mouthfeel isn't bad, but there isn't much life to the wine. It tastes bitter and oceanic, like horseradish and sea shell. Foamy and coarse on the finish.",Spain,Macabeo
"Raisin and funky leather are the prime aromas on this marginal Tempranillo. Expect a dried-out, tart and herbal wine, with a raisiny sweetness.",Spain,Tempranillo

"Melon and almond skin aromas lead to pithy citrus on what amounts to a pretty good bouquet. Round, citrusy and fresh in the mouth, with orange, passion fruit and tropical leanings. Solid and well shaped for a $7 quaffer. 70% Airen and 30% Macabeo.",Spain,White Blend

"The Gil family understands how to make fully loaded reds that are balanced and highly enjoyable. Look for a saturated, rich nose with brandied plum, blackberry pastry and toasty oak notes. The palate is both lush and racy, with dark berry and chocolate flavors. It finishes huge and masculine, almost like fudge. Drink now–2015.",Spain,Garnacha
"Deeply layered and pure on the nose, with tar, cola and toasty oak aromas, this feels deep, full and choppy, with tough tannins and seriously dark flavors of blackened spice, berry and bitter chocolate. It's very long on the finish, which has a tough feel but is generous and loaded with power. Drink 2013–2018; 275 cases made.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Rooty and slightly green smelling, with rhubarb and cherry skin aromas. Despite a limited bouquet, the palate has weight and creaminess along with sweet berry fruit flavors. Molasses, brown sugar and blackberry finishing notes confirm the wine's heavy makeup.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Aromas of carpet cleaner and stems constitute a strange mix, while the palate shows good weight and zest along with flavors of candied white fruits and orange peel. Abundant sweetness thickens the finish, and overall it seems like a strange style for everyday consumption.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"We aren't suggesting that this inexpensive Moscato sparkler is great or for everyone, but its soda-like aromas of lychee and lime are not bad and the flavors of honeydew, lime and lychee are decent. Good enough for cake or fruit-based desserts.",Spain,Moscato
"Dark and forceful, with an earthy nose of tar, leather and baked fruit. The palate has life and size, but also quasi-sharp acidity, while flavors of blackberry carry a lactic, vanilla undertone. Finishes sweet but a little burnt.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit more rubbery and hard than in the past, with a foamy palate feel and burnt flavors that hint at grilled melon and papaya. Seems sort of lazy and mealy on the finish, and overall it doesn't click past o.k.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Warm out of the chute, with raisin and herb aromas. The palate is soft and wide, with chewy berry flavors and a spice-herb accent to the flavor profile. A little baked on the finish; jammy overall.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Heavy and rasiny, with a mildly cooked essence to the nose. The blend is 80% Prieto Picudo and 20% Mencia, and together it adds up to an unctuous wine with berry, fudge and prune characteristics. Has the size but not the balance or pizzazz to rate higher.",Spain,Red Blend
"The cherry and berry aromas are friendly and ripe. It feels flush, edgy and a little tannic, with a fresh berry flavor that's bundled with a touch of herb. The tasty berry flavor holds form on the medium-length finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is a touch wheaty and creamy on the nose, with moderate oxidation for a manzanilla. Lemony acidity keeps things tangy and crisp, while the flavors are fresh and nutty, with controlled acidic sharpness. Dry nut notes and an apricot-related tang carry the finish.",Spain,Sherry
"Initially, this may smell a bit hot and leafy, but with time that quality settles. It feels narrow, tannic and condensed, with roasted flavors of red berry, spice and chocolate. The finish offers a mix of citrus, red berry and herb flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A nice little wine for easy times. The light citrus aromas lean toward grapefruit, while the fresh, mild palate features apple and tangerine flavors but very little sharpness. Zesty enough on the finish, with a lasting taste of passion fruit.",Spain,White Blend
"Raisiny and sweeet smelling, with baked qualities but also a bitter bite of horseradish. The palate is deep and hard, with burnt notes, tough tannins and berry flavors softened by buttery oak. Beefy and rubbery, but with enough ripeness to be worth a look.",Spain,Red Blend
"Blackberry and other fruits are presented clearly on the nose, while the rubbery, bouncy palate seems properly tight and balanced. Sweet, stretched-out flavors of black plum and berry are warm and youthful. Good for basic drinking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Magenta-colored, berry loaded and fresh, all of which help what could be a pedestrian wine reach a higher plane. Sweet cherry and plum flavors mix with snappy acidity and good structure, and overall you get a refreshing, satisfying wine with genuine appeal.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rich and very good, with depth and a chocolaty essence that shows itself on the front and back ends of the wine. Pure in terms of berry fruit flavors, and with good verve and mouthfeel. A balanced, spot-on wine with serious structure, style and follow through. Drink now–2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy, rich and black as night, with roasted blackberry aromas that draw you in. Then the palate keeps you there, and even if it runs a bit hard and tannic, the integrity and flavors of coconut, roasted berry and coffee are fine and dandy. Boisterous and big, but that's Toro for you.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A rich, more modern type of Rioja with dark color, slightly raisiny berry aromas and molasses, vanilla and mocha on the nose. The palate is full and chewy, with cola, fig and wild berry flavors. Stylish and creamy on the finish, and very pleasant as a whole. 55% Tempranillo with four other grapes blended in, including Graciano and Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Tres Picos, or Three Peaks, ranks as a go-to wine for fans of round, smooth, slightly oaky reds. The bouquet is all mocha and smoky/oaky richness, while the sticky, rich palate deals blackberry and chewy, rooty medicinality. Oaky and spicy late, with licorice and warmth. The best thing is that it's not heavy or overextracted despite being youthful and modern in style.",Spain,Garnacha
"Cherry and raspberry aromas are a little scratchy, with accents of toast, leather and roasted meat. The palate, on the other hand, is more lean, driving and citric than in riper years; it's crisp and fresh, with red plum, pie cherry and toasty oak flavors. Clean, lean and ready to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This five-grape blend is dark and concentrated, but also a touch soupy and mulchy. Interestingly, the palate shows snappy acidity along the edges, yielding crisp flavors of cherry, raspberry and spice. Finishes dry, herbal and spicy, but needs a boost of fruit to equal previous efforts.",Spain,Red Blend
"Red in color, with a reedy, cinnamon nose that speaks to the 60% Pinot Noir in the wine. Flavors of strawberry and raspberry are downgraded by a rhubarb quality, and the mouthfell clamps down like a vise. Fruity but not dry or balanced enough to impress.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"If it weren't for the core fruit, which is pretty good, this wine would tank. It's so heavy and dark that it doesn't seem like it will last another week. Probably better if you're sitting in the town of Calatayud; as an export, it's from too warm of a climate to hold up to the travel.",Spain,Rosé
"Lollipop aromas are muddled and not very convincing, while the palate is unfocused and borders on sour. Foamy and abrasive on the cheeks, with a mediocre flavor profile. From the outside this looks great (nice bottle and label) but the insides are shaky.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Oxidized and fading, with leftover pear on the nose. The palate has residual acidity but the fruit is short on flavor, while the finish is briny and citric.",Spain,Albariño
"Semi-dry Cavas are a risky row, and this wine proves why. It has iodine and dusty lemon aromas, while the palate is chunky and flat, with sweet orange and other candied citrus flavors. Bland and bordering on cloying.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Jumbled aromas of medicinal fruit, rubber and oak knit together with airing. The palate is clampy and angular but healthy, with a roasted black-fruit flavor that's accented by an herbal, medicinal note. This is big-boned, with a medicinal side.",Spain,Monastrell
"This feels mildly citric, with limited portions of lemon, apple and peach making up the flavor profile. Mild on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dusty and straightforward on the nose, this has aromas of pear and apple. It feels simple, tight and not overly evolved, with a peach flavor that's not too complex. Zesty in feel, this tastes a bit like vitamins and nuts on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dry apple and crisp citrus aromas come with a touch of sweet grass. It has lively lemon-lime and apple flavors, and it seems to have beeen dosed on the sweeter side of extra dry. Overall, it's fruity, friendly and likable.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This starts with funky, saucy aromas that clean up and become less strange with airing. Rugged, tannic and bumpy on the palate, it has baked, rubbery black-fruit flavors. It finishes short and drying, with hard tannins and heat.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Gaseous, earthy, mossy aromas are not entirely inviting, and the palate is immensely thick and round, with big, grating tannins. But the plum, berry and meaty elements are good, and the finish of chewy tannins goes on for quite some time. An extracted wine with minor balance and aromatic issues.",Spain,Mencía
"Banana, lemon curd and sawdust are the prime aromas on this oaky, creamy, candied style of Chard from Navarra. The palate is soft and modern, with decent core acidity propping up papaya, melon and green banana flavors. Resiny on the finish, but smooth.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Candied and sweet smelling but still honest on the nose, with spice, cinnamon and black cherry aromas. The palate is fresh and healthy feeling, with mildly creamy cherry, berry and mocha flavors. Finishes creamy as well, with lasting sweetness. 60% Garnacha with 35% Tempranillo and 5% Mazuelo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fruity, sweet, a touch rubbery, and very much what you should expect from a good, ready, well-made Garnacha from Aragón. The palate is lush and full, with snappy blackberry, raspberry and plum flavors. Round on the finish, with size and texture. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Garnacha
"A fine wine but not up to par with previous renditions. This vintage has proprietary blueberry, floral and jammy aromas, while the palate is narrow and a touch sheering and tannic, with jammy dark berry flavors and not a lot of variety or complexity. Forward, linear and monotone, but what's here is quite good. Drink now–2013.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"As far as value-priced Ruedas go, this is at the top of the heap. The nose is forward, clean as glass and not too pungent or demanding. Solid as can be across the tongue, with green fruit flavors that shine and don't force the issue. Crystalline and pure from start to finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Full and spicy from the get-go, with hints of clove vying with savory berry and leather. The optimum word to describe this wine is friendly, meaning it delivers ripeness, berry flavors and sweet, spicy accents that complete the package. Leans toward baked and sweet but keeps things properly framed.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is supersmooth and attractive, with earth, cola, tobacco, balsam and solid berry aromas. The palate rings with vitality, while the flavor profile consists of an ideal mix of vanilla, herb, tomato and berry. Dry on the finish, with a leathery note. Drink now–2018.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Sweet, candied aromas run toward raisin, while the acidic, choppy palate deals both red currant sourness and raisiny sweetness. Finishes short but chunky, with biting acidity. Below-average stuff.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Made from the local Rufete grape, this is a prickly, slightly pickled wine. The flavors seem underdeveloped and pithy like pink grapefruit, while the palate feel doesn't really mesh. Too out there to savor a second sip.",Spain,Rufete
"Burnt and cheesy smelling, with undefined, leafy red-fruit flavors. Hard and tannic in the mouth, with herbal flavors and a hint of green on the finish. Seems less than clean.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Plum, spice and baked-fruit aromas give you some hope, but the palate on this no-dosage Pinot Noir Cava is tart to the point of being sour. Flavors of cherry skins and currants are austere, while the finish is rhubarby.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Apple and dry spice aromas comprise the restrained but pleasant bouquet. It feels good, healthy and dry as a bone, with briney white-fruit flavors. It tastes mildly pickled on the finish, but it shows good feel and balance.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A good taste of Toro at the right price. The nose deals classic baked fruit, rubber and girth, while the warm, full palate shows reasonable vitality along with berry and cassis flavors. Solid and a little chocolaty on the finish. A textbook warm-climate Spanish wine.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Perfectly drinkable Monastrell year after year despite the silly name. Plum and roasted berry aromas and flavors are sweet, ripe, clean and on the generic side of the fence. A little rugged and hot at 15%, but lusty and good for the price.",Spain,Monastrell
"Lemon, apple blossom and honey aromas make for a correct, attractive bouquet. Meanwhile, the palate is typically crisp and vibrant, with cutting acids that push the pineapple and citrus flavors to a point. Long and exact on the finish, and overall there's not an ounce of flab to this streamlined white.",Spain,Albariño
"Alconte is the new second wine from Montecastro, but it doesn't take a back seat to anything. It's powerful juice, with a strong mineral/floral element on the bouquet. Aged only a year in oak, it maintains a crisp, charred character and shows tight raspberry flavors, chocolate and pepper. Features all the right stuff for a debut wine from a strained vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Concentrated and solid, but not a wrecking ball. The nose offers tobacco and earthy aromas, while the palate is jammy and smooth, with sweet flavors of blackberry, fig and tobacco. Spicy enough and pretty long on the finish, with another wave of tobacco. Almost too ripe but not quite. 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Syrah, as is the 87-point 2006 vintage.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"For an '07, this shows nice fruit and a direct, honest approach. The nose offers up spice and berry aromas along with some buttery oak, and that creamy woodiness carries onto the palate and blends well with juicy, crisp red fruit flavors that are representative of the vintage and region. Drink now–2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Roasted and rubbery, this features potent leather and compost aromas that settle with airing. Angular, aggressive and full of power and lemony oak, it also has raw wood and heavily toasted black-fruit flavors. Long, peppery and choppy, it's powerful and stomping. Best to hold this for 3–5 years before drinking, when it should emerge as a better, more approachable wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Expansive and generous on the nose, this has all the bold berry aromas for which Ribera del Duero is known. It feels tight as a drum, with staunch acidity. Flavors of dark fruit and chocolate are typical for a small-production—150 cases—modern wine. It's tight, spicy and integrated on the finish, with a lasting note of lemony oak. Best 2014–2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Modest lime and stone aromas don't give it much push, and the bubbly, foamy palate of candied apple and other sweet fruits isn't much of a savior. With soda-like qualities and lemon-lime on the finish, it's your basic quaffable Cava.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Better upon previous tastings. This time around it seems tough and rubbery, with a caustic burn to the nose. The palate is sweet and burnt, with caramel and raw berry fruit. Lacks freshness.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A tart, stemmy wine with sour red-fruit flavors borrowed from the cherry and plum families. Choppy and acidic, with a biting palate and not much good on offer. It's 50% Rufete and 50% Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Salinic smelling, with a spot of nectarine on the nose. The palate is full and chunky, with thick plum and raspberry flavors that fail to refresh. Tastes pithy and mildly bitter on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"A sweet and cloying style of rosé. The bouquet is punch-bowl sweet, with mango and berry aromas, while the palate is like a fruit smoothie. Too sweet, with no edge.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A jumbled wine with strange aromas of bacon and wild herbs that are followed by a clipped, scouring palate that's driven by ultrasharp acidity. Too little ripeness and way too much tartness equals a sketchy, unrecommended wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cristalino has always done well with crisp, straightforward Cavas. This attempt at something higher fails; it's a cidery, flat wine without much kick, zest or bead. Chunky and lacking electricity.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This begins with a light red-fruit aroma that falls into the cherry-berry vein. It feels bouncy, rubbery and pleasant, with roasted, rubbery berry and savory spice flavors. The finish is light on fruit but good in feel.",Spain,Monastrell
"Interesting aromas of brick dust, mint, fall leaf and dried fruit seem traditional and familiar. The palate is tight, tannic and rubbery, with roasted, savory flavors of spiced berry and plum. Oak, prune and fig notes work the firm finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"This smells yeasty and peachy, with a maderized quality to the bouquet. It tastes cidery and citrusy, with a light body and not much in the way of bubbles or vitality. The flavors of apple, lemon and peach are fair and fleshy. Tastes pithy on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Clean, minerally and smells of tarragon, fresh bell pepper and lemony citrus. Feels lively, with pink grapefruit, passion fruit, lime and generic sweetness for flavors. A lip-smacking wine that's varietally accurate. 60% Verdejo and 40% SB.",Spain,Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc
"Big boysenberry aromas are lively, a bit minty and fresh, while the extracted palate has a fruit-driven personality, ample tannins and dark wild-berry flavors. Young, bouncy and tangy on the finish. Composed for a young, inexpensive red.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with sweet berry and plum aromas and later there's earthy heft. The palate is big, acidic and fruity, with bold, stretched-out berry flavors. Finishes with a touch of bitterness and rubber, but overall it's a perfectly solid, grapey, tightly wound wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Decent and quaffable but does not compare to the winery's Verdejo. This is prickly and full of pine needle, juniper and other sharp aromas. The palate has a good feel but pickled, briney flavors. Skeletal given its warm-climate origins.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Raspberry and rubber aromas are solid if not refined, while the firm palate is sweet and full of black cherry flavor. Rough, tumble and unsophisticated in the mouthfeel department but ripe and tasty throughout, with dark shadings on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A round and smooth version of Albariño, with apricot and orange aromas. The palate has a layered, creamy feel and full flavors of bulky apricot, peach and also citrus. Fleshy on the finish, and definitely at peak maturity. Drink right away.",Spain,Albariño
"Toasty right away, with lightly baked apple aromas. The palate has a fine feel and good overall intensity, while the flavors of lemon, white grapefruit and apple are subtle and clean. Long and persistent, and showing quite a bit for a standard nonvintage Cava.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A toasty, yeasty, organic grape Cava with butterscotch, vanilla and baked fruit aromas. The palate has good balance, while the flavors are citric but not sour, with pineapple and orange leading the fight. Clean and not complicated, but more elegant than the average Spanish sparkler.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Clean lines and fresh, oak-tinged aromas is what this Viura (with 10% Malvasia) is all about. The nose starts with lemon, green apple and a spot of vanilla, while the juicy palate brings bright white fruits, toasty oak and smoke. Not overly complex but not rudimentary or dull. A nice food wine and probably the best barrel-fermented white from Muga we've tried.",Spain,White Blend
"Only 400 cases of this top-level crianza were made, and it smells rich and good, with notes of ripe berry and plum and a mild syrupy note. Although it feels big, it's also fresh and layered, with pure berry, herb, spice and oak flavors. Toasty, smooth and elegant as a whole. Drink now–2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Roasted meat, leather, animal and stout berry aromas make for an inviting bouquet. Like most serious Toro wines, this is hard but fresh and layered, with lively black-fruit flavors that darken under the control of oaky spice. Tobacco, menthol and mint ring loudly on the finish. Drink now–2018; 200 cases made.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Emphatically toasty and charred on the nose, this offers chocolate and hickory aromas. It feels smooth, plush, layered and not at all simple, with baked black-fruit flavors that are draped over savory barbecue and spice accents. The toast is present but not overpowering on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is extremely fruity, with an exotic bouquet of blueberry, cardamom, nutmeg and earth aromas. It feels smooth, collected and fairly rich, with savory, lightly baked flavors of black fruit. The finish remains savory, where graham cracker sweetness and roasted qualities dominate.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dusty and smooth upfront, this has attractive orange, nectarine and cream aromas. It feels layered and balanced, with cantaloupe, orange and milk chocolate flavors vying for attention. Mild but composed on the finish, this is made entirely from Trepat.",Spain,Trepat
"The grape is Parraleta, the region is Somontano, and the end result is more original than attractive. The wine is hot, grassy and tart. It falls flat and tastes dull and wan. Lots of acid and scour; not much else.",Spain,Parraleta
"Alvaro Palacios is as meticulous as any vintner when it comes to vine maintenance and winemaking. His Finca Dofi blends Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon with some Syrah and sometimes Merlot, and the result is extremely impressive vintage after vintage. This wine is alluring, silky smooth and endowed with beautiful herb and mineral notes along with light oak, fine tannins and non-stop length on the finish. It's drinkable right now and should hold steady and/or improve over the next five years. Imported by Rare Wine Company. Editors' Choice.",Spain,Red Blend
"Woodsy, perfumed and light on the nose, this has rosebud and lemon peel aromas. The palate shows a touch of resiny oak, with flavors of raspberry and chocolate, ending with a hint of vanilla.",Spain,Bobal
"Crisp and likable, this smells stony and snappy, with spring pea, passion fruit and citrus aromas. It feels well cut, with green bean, grass and citrus flavors. While it hints at being vegetal, it maintains a consistent white-fruit and citrus profile.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc-Verdejo
"Sweet, ripe, rich and a little baked on the bold bouquet, with a good mouthfeel, layered blackberry and plum fruit, and then a long, robust and clean finish. As value-priced Garnacha from Spain goes, this is on the dot.",Spain,Garnacha
"More traditional and Old World in style, with some light oak supporting aromas of rubber, smoked meats, leather and berry fruit. There's good life to the bouncy palate along with flavors of zesty plum and cherry. Snappy and crisp on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Smells waxy, as if it has slipped past its prime. The palate still sports a beam of bright acidity but there isn't much body or lees to accompany the richness, so the volume is low as a whole. Tastes good, but mostly like citrus and fresh fruit juice.",Spain,Albariño
"Pungent, grassy and ultrafresh, with citric aromas and textbook scents of wild grass, nettles and passionfruit. The palate is similar, with passionfruit, green melon and citrus front and center. The feel is wet and flashy, and overall this is a very nice wine to match with salads, fish and the like.",Spain,Verdejo
"Delicious and ready to drink. The nose brims with lemon peel, minerality, saline and natural vanilla. In the mouth, it's healthy and ready to go, with citrusy lead flavors along with requisite green apple. Still fresh and crisp despite having been released a year ago. A wine to enjoy immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"This is a really good example of a blended wine from Aragón. It's 50% Garnacha with 25% each Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon, and thus it is more complex and interesting than your run-of-the-mill varietal Grenache. Mellow aromas of ripe fruit and spice open things up, followed by balanced flavors of berry fruits, vanilla and cream. Easygoing and highly recommended for the price.",Spain,Red Blend
"A wine that reflects its northern Ribera location (Sotillo) through zesty, pointed aromas and some gritty char and minerality. The nose shows plenty of solid oak, chocolate and spice, and in the mouth the acids are a bit sharp and thus the wine is kind of spiky and angular. Still, it's a very nice RDD, just not as generous as it could or should be. Drink now–2019.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Yellowing to the eye, with waxy vanilla aromas along with toasty lemon and apple scents. For an '07 it's hanging in well even if it's creamy and rich, with banana and lemon cream pie flavors. Best to drink now; 70% Viura and 30% Malvasia.",Spain,White Blend
"Floral and fruity, with clean aromas. In the mouth, it's saturated and intense as if offers up a meaty set of dense fruit flavors. Doesn't show as much complexity, layering and variety as we might like to see, but it's pretty flashy and good for a 2007, a vintage that was problematic in this region.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is perfectly welcoming and complex upfront, with dried raspberry, leather and light herb aromas. It feels stylish and layered, with flavors of berry, earth and integrated oak. Classy and smooth on the finish, drink this now–2020.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with touches of coconut, mineral, violet petals and sweet black fruits. The mouthfeel is textured and smooth, while the flavors of raspberry, blackberry and plum are deep, delectable and of very high quality. This is Ribera del Duero wine at the optimal intersection of power, flavor and human care and concern. Drink now and over the next four years. Imported by Fine Estates From Spain. Editors' Choice.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Very ripe, rich and rewarding. Perpetual is Torres' top wine from the Priorat, and it's a winner in 2006; it has polish, power and life. The nose is dark and alluring, while the palate hits comfortably with bold black cherry, cured meat, herb and tobacco flavors. Long and honest on the finish, with thrust. Good now thru 2013. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co. Editors' Choice.",Spain,Red Blend
"Golden in color, this has bready baked-apple aromas. It feels plump and soft for a brut nature, with a maderized quality to the palate. It tastes extremely dry, like seltzer water blended with citrus, almond and butterscotch. It continues on the same flavor plane throughout the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The oyster and clam shell aromas are briney to say the least. The palate is acidic and scouring, with lime, lemon and green melon flavors. It turns pithy on the finish, then a little bitter.",Spain,Albariño
"The aromas are slightly maderized and soft, with hints of baked apple and corn cake. It feels plump, mealy and a touch flat, with nectarine and wheat flavors. Chunky and peachy on the finish, this is starting to fade.",Spain,Verdejo
"Neutral for the most part, with a slight citric pungency. Tastes like apple, spice and dried papaya, and the feel is round as opposed to zesty or angular. Lasting on the back end, with a final note of grapefruit.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"A little rusty in color, with earthy, stemmy, baked fruit aromas mixed with a dose of dried leaves. Seems a lot like Cabernet Franc with its herbal, leafy overtones and dry plum and cherry flavors. Finishes short and herbal, but with good feel and flow.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"The nose shows buttered popcorn, toast and baked apple, while the palate is tangy and tastes of tart white fruits, green apple and toast. Has good flow and a cleansing feel to it. Not bad for an oaky blend of Viura and Chardonnay.",Spain,White Blend
"Floral, sweet and not the least bit complicated or strained. This is easygoing red wine for easy times. It's a bit candied and baked, but that's Garnacha from Central Spain. Decently balanced and sturdy, especially given the price tag.",Spain,Grenache
"Medicinal black fruit aromas are a little burnt and brambly, while the palate is snappy, acidic and tannic, with tomato, raspberry and oak-driven creaminess. Finishes dry, with a lasting flavor of vanilla that tempers overriding acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Spicy and jumpy on the nose, with pine and juniper notes coming alongside more normal berry and cherry scents. The palate has a severe snappy, citrusy, narrow feel and flavors of cherry, red plum and cherry tomato. Lightly herbal and oaky on the finish, with good length.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Roasted and charred, with a a clear and present barrel influence along with thyme, herbs and tomato leaf. In the mouth, it's sweet and ready, with ripe berry flavors touched up by cocoa. Toasty and a little minty on the finish, but flavorful and perfectly good as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A good to very good wine with medicinality on the nose that takes over the aromatics. There's also the slightest bit of hard cheese and stem on the bouquet, so overall it is fighting an uphill battle. Along the way it delivers flavors of cough drop, cherry and a good, solid finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"If someone says Vilarnau brut, you should say, yes, I'd love a glass. This bubbly will win you over with its dense but controlled palate and flavors of orange and sweet, ripe grapefruit. It has a bit of green to it and it draws back nicely on the tongue without overfizzing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Falls into the dark and roasted category, with aromas of leather, black fruits and toast. The palate is saturated and full, with dark, roasted black fruit, molasses and spice flavors. Warm on the finish almost to the point of being hot, but not quite. A very solid wine overall.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Deep and earthy smelling, with meatiness, black fruit and hickory notes to the bouquet. The wine offers concentration and thickness, with ripe, slightly medicinal flavors of plum and blackberry. The same goes for the finish, and overall this is a medium-to-full Grenache that gets it done.",Spain,Grenache
"Sweet and full of raspberry aromas, foresty scents and sandalwood. Overall it's a well-made, intriguing Grenache with a fleshy, sturdy body and deep cherry, berry and chocolate flavors. It's a bit tannic, but that only helps the structure. Finishes nicely, with dry spice and vanilla notes.",Spain,Garnacha
"Briary berry, leather and animal aromas comprise the bouquet on this full-forced effort. Astringent and jumpy in feel, it has piercing acidity, propelling the tangy flavors of berry, currant and plum. It's toasty, offering a pinch of tobacco on the finish. Drink 2013–2017.",Spain,Tinta Fina
"Graham cracker, raisin, earth and leather aromas announce a level of richness. It feels prune-like and saturated but not flat, with blackberry and exotic spice flavors. It qualifies as a lush, ripe specimen with a long finish that stays the course. Syrah, Cabernet and Tempranillo are the components.",Spain,Red Blend
"A high level of purity from the start. The bouquet attracts with strong scents of mineral, flowers, wild herbs, berry fruit and toast. There's no shortage of bracing acidity, so the body weight and balance are just right. One of Spain's most food-friendly, elegant wines, and not run of the mill. The best expression of Mencia on the market today.",Spain,Mencía
"Starts out with stalky, corny aromas that are typical of sweet Cavas. It feels candied and almost cloying, but adequate acidity comes to the rescue. Flavors of melon, mango and kiwi are sweet, while the finish suggests corn cakes and tropical fruits.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This smells like fresh pavement at first, with gritty black-fruit and burnt leaf notes. The palate feels edgy, with a spotty red-fruit flavor that's matched with notes of resiny oak and vanilla. It finishes in a similar fashion. Novo Imports and Aidil Wines & Liquors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Generic peach and melon aromas are pleasant, clean and simple, while flavors of pineapple, melon, mango and kumquat are basic and sweet, almost like canned fruit salad. Finishes pithy, with some banana-like sweetness.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Wild, foxy and full of young, bursting berry fruit. There's nothing tamed or refined or special about this youthful Tempranillo. The flavors of plum and berries are intense, bright, grabby and modest in what they deliver. Consistent wine from year to year.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts with earthy burnt aromas, but in short time cassis and berry aromas rise to the surface. Fresh and tangy feeling, with spunky red fruit and tomato flavors. Finishes a little saucy, with more tomato and an herbal aftertaste.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Full, sweet, a touch reduced and granular on the nose, but exemplary of what affordable Garnacha from a good vintage should be like. The palate is stacked and deep, while the flavors are a mix of wild berry, rubber, toast and espresso. Turns a bit hot on the finish, but food will tame that. Drink now.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dark as night and thick, with heavy, modern aromas of shoe polish, bacon and ripe, roasted black fruits. The feel is concentrated and healthy, while the flavors run very ripe and dark, with plenty of oak thrown in. Finishes rich, with bacon, resin, black pepper and some burn. Seems more jacked up than its listed 14.5% alcohol.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Crisp, clean and nice on the nose, with a hint of white pepper. The palate is round and not overly acidic, making it friendly and endowed with mass appeal. Flavors of green melon and citrus are smooth and not too demanding, while the finish is easy and clean. A welcome entry into the land of Rueda and its Verdejo.",Spain,Verdejo
"In many ways, this is Valdemar's best wine in that it's always consistent and satisfying. The nose on this vintage offers a blast of sweet coconut and then black fruit aromas, and while there's acidity front and center it doesn't come across sharp. Instead, the focus is on plum and raspberry fruit and a finish that picks up steam.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Snappy and a little green on the nose, with hints of juniper and green apple. The palate is perfectly good but nothing special, while the flavors of apple and citrus are punchy and pure. Frothy but controlled, with lots of flavor and forward kick. Apéritif city!",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"For those who like an old-school, oxidized style of white Rioja (think López de Heredia), Murrieta's Capellanía is up your alley. The nose is almost like Sherry in its creamy, maderized state, while the palate is low in power, with coconut and lemon flavors. Finishes soft, with vanilla. A unique, identifiable white wine that's not for everyone. Drink now.",Spain,White Blend
"Minty and on the nose, this has notes of licorice, black fruit and a funky kick. It feels big, tannic, powerful and warm, with wild berry and boysenberry notes, plus a ton of dark spice, chocolate and mild heat. Toasty and extremely dark on the finish.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Focused and salinic, offering mild white-flower and peach aromas, this feels full, round, fleshy and balanced, with pithy citrus, peach and almond flavors that lead nicely to a smooth, melony finish. This is about as complex as Albariño gets.",Spain,Albariño
"Minimum was impressive wine in 2003 and it's better in 2004. Cambra's blend of 70% Monastrell and 30% Cabernet Franc is probably the best wine coming from the obscure Valencia D.O. It is generous, balanced, rich and lusty; flavors of blackberry, cassis and plum are succulent and every hole or gap seems filled by tannin, flesh and flavor. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Red Blend
"Gaseous berry aromas settle on pepper, oregano and earth tones. It feels tight, full and potent, with herbal, peppery flavors of black fruit and licorice. This turns more meaty and pumped up as it unfolds—much more rugged than refined.",Spain,Red Blend
"Straightforward peach aromas come with a stalky, grassy side. It feels zesty, spritzy and citric, then tastes almost entirely of orange and tangerine, with a dry finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Ripe, minty and exuberant on the front end, this has a hint of animal in addition to a note of blueberry. Saturated and simple, this has a ripe red-berry flavor that comes across as red licorice. Fruity and fun.",Spain,Red Blend
"Forward and direct up front, this has a yeasty but fresh apple aroma. It feels clean and ready, with lemon-lime and kiwi flavors that lead to a fresh finish. This is textbook Cava with some sweetness.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Nervy raspberry and cherry aromas come with a pinch of green herb. It feels astringent yet structured and crisp, with edgy red-berry and herb flavors. Lively, fiery and mildly acidic on the finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"Raisiny on the nose, but even with the bouquet's overripeness, it settles on the palate, showing fresh raisin and cassis flavors, with just enough acidity to keep it balanced. Jammy and short on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly cooked-smelling on first take, with hints of stem and rubber. It improves over time, showing earthy berry fruits and leather. The palate is pretty good and lively, with earthy, herbal flavors of berry, tea and spice. A little stewy and herbal, but still a good Ribera wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of milk chocolate, cotton candy, bacon and sweet fruits are a lead into standard fare cherry and raspberry flavors. The feel is acidic but fresh, while the finish is thin but clean. Average wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with black cherry, baked plum and other heavy, semiroasted aromas. The palate is chunky but weak on definition and structure, while the flavors are limited to dry red-apple skins and bland red fruit. Acidic as well, which leads to a washed-out finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pure and driving, but also acidic and woody in aromas and flavors. Can't say that this barrel fermented Viura-based white is Muga's best wine. It's crisp with green apple and pineapple, but also a little sour and simple. With 10% Malvasia.",Spain,Viura
"Vanilla and a lot of oak blend with baked apple on the nose, while the palate is grabby and resiny, with drawn, oak-heavy flavors of baked apple and vanilla. For a winery that rarely misses with its red wines, this is one that's o.k. but probably not worth the money.",Spain,White Blend
"Opens with generic berry aromas and a slight candied, gaseous undercurrent. The palate is modest and lean, with decent raspberry flavors and not a whole lot of follow through. Basic and a bit rubbery.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Begins with a sweet marshmallow creaminess on the nose, which is followed by a firm, tanninc palate with snappy cherry and raspberry flavors. Clean and easy to understand, but in the end it's a very regular wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Briar and rhubarb aromas suggest stemminess, but the palate is fairly clean and clear, with tight, rubbery tannins supporting red fruit flavors of cherry and plum. Short, rubbery and unexceptional, but good enough despite a whiff of green that's probably due to the Cabernet in the wine.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Nice wine with standard Rioja aromas of raspberry, vanilla, licorice and dill. The palate has life and kick due to protruding acidity, while the flavor profile is based on snappy, high-toned plum and red berry. Softer on the finish, where butter and vanilla notes rise up. Drinkable now but will hold for another few years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with young, punchy aromas of candied raspberry and strawberry. The body is easygoing but the flavors and overall character are more complex than you might expect because Sastre only made this wine and a crianza in '08 while eschewing its high-end wines. With this youngster expect moderate size and intensity, and a full, semilong finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Like the barrica (barrel) in its name implies, this is a toasty wine, with vanilla, yeast and elegant white-fruit aromas. Full bodied, it has citrus and apple notes, with mild oxidation in front of the toasty finish. A classy Cava to drink now.",Spain,Macabeo
"Milk chocolate, plastic and wet dog aromas improve with airing. It's abrasive and scratchy on the palate, with blackberry and milk chocolate flavors that lead to a finish with one last dosage of milk chocolaty sweetness. This contains 15% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This offers grassy, ashy aromas of green-leaning berry and plum fruits. It feels grabby and choppy, with berry flavors that lead to a dry, lightly herbal-tasting finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"This opens with a blast of berry fruit and a note of spice. It feels bouncy, full and healthy, with black fruits and dark spices comprising the flavor profile. The finish is short, but fruity and clean.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Saline, mineral, match stick and tropical fruit aromas define the bouquet. It feels plump but flat, with maderized flavors of white fruits that feature bitterness and not much kick. It's fleshy, remaining slightly bitter on the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"This starts with some Verdejo sweat and funk on the nose, and while those notes don't last, the bouquet doesn't improve dramatically with airing. It feels soft and basic, with melon and lettuce flavors. Falls off a bit on the finish, which tastes a bit briney.",Spain,Verdejo
"This has raisin, earth, mint and dried herb aromas. It feels narrow, but concentrated, tasting of earthy tomato, baked plum and fresh green herb. It has a solid mouthfeel, with a mildly briney finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A granular, horsey note is the greeting, and never does this truly find its sweet spot. The aromas are raisiny, while the palate is angular and acidic. Flavors of tomato, herb, tobacco and plum don't quite find their footing. The finish is thick and tastes of molasses, carob and herb.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark on the nose, with licorice notes and mildly roasted black fruit aromas. Ripe, properly sized and balanced, with lightly candied blackberry flavors leading to a smooth finish with a hint of coffee. For the price and origin, it's right on.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Just makes it to that next level of quality via bright, jumpy, fresh aromas and flavors of raspberry and cherry. It's a simple varietal Grenache that's bright and easy to like if you're into zesty raspberry and berry flavors uplifted by spunky acidity. Best with a little chill on the temperature.",Spain,Garnacha
"Opens with decent dusty apple and peach aromas, but they don't really hold together for long. And the palate is similar in that it offers adequate opening flavors of green apple and citrus but no improvement after that. Drink right away; it won't age well.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"More soft and milky than exact or pungent, with bitterness intermixed with apple on the palate. Feels a little soft and bland for such a young Rueda white. Perfectly drinkable but uninspired.",Spain,Verdejo
"Pithy, heavy and chunky, with waxy fruit mixed with oak. The wine has a pretty good mouthfeel and balance, but it just doesn't do much in terms of aromatics or in the flavor category. Decent for a barrel fermented Viura but nothing to write home about.",Spain,White Blend
"Raisiny and baked on the nose, with a syrupy consistency to the palate. Along the way there's stewed fruit, baked blackberry pie notes and overt sweetness. Candied, ultrarich and tilting toward molasses on the finish.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Not a lot to latch onto here. The aromas are sharp and sweaty, while the palate feel is more dull than it should be, while flavors of melon and pickled fruits are briney.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Familiar aromas of black fruit, licorice and earth get it going, followed by saturated body weight that reaches all corners of the mouth while displaying earthy, chunky blackberry and black cherry flavors. Flush, comfortable and slightly heavy. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"From Miguel Angel de Gregorio of Finca Allende, this is a nice, thorough, creamy white with aromas of white fruits, vanilla and straw. The palate has spiced peach, apple and pear flavors, and the finish is exceedingly creamy and deep. Shows elegance and adequate power, but needs to be drunk soon.",Spain,Viura
"Good, pure, dark and teetering on powerful, with strong, rich black plum aromas. The mouth is staunch and balanced, with full dark fruit flavors of blackberry along with bitter chocolate. Solid and clean throughout. A winner in its price range.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smooth, fresh aromas suggest apple blossoms and sea air. The palate offers a proper zesty mouthfeel, zingy acidity, natural creaminess and nice flavors of green apple, sour melon and pineapple. At the end, lemony zap and lemongrass grace the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"This is cool on the nose, with tree bark and tobacco aromas that come together well. Tannic and stout, it's not punishing, with a roasted black-fruit flavor and a backing of espresso bitterness. This shows a syrupy side and also raw power. Drink now–2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy berry, licorice, herb and leather aromas set up a lively, fresh palate that boasts tomato, raspberry, plum and herb flavors. It shows good energy and balance throughout, with a forward attitude and a spicy, solid finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Among Cavas, this is one of the more yeasty, full-bodied and creamy wines you'll find; it's also cidery, dusty and heavy on the nose. Round, it offers plenty of depth to frame the flavors of candied peach, melon, pear, tarragon and thyme. Although it's a bit foamy and coarse, overall this is a flavorful, complex, demanding Cava to drink now–2015.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This opens with balsamic, briary aromas that include herb, olive and greenness. It wine feels big, full and generally well balanced, with roasted flavors of earth and herbal berry that reflect the bouquet. Tobacco, coffee and leather components drive the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This opens with big aromas of black fruit compote, molasses and maple. It feels tannic and grabby, with notes of black cherry, dark plum and vanilla controlling the flavor profile. It finishes big, tight and chalky, due to tannic residue. Powerful and composed, drink now–2016.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Here's yet another impressive Garnacha-based wine from the traveling Scotsman Norrel Robertson. There's a black-fruit component that's aided by dried oregano, thyme and briar. The mouth, however, is juicy and ripe, with Syrah-influenced flavors of spice and herbs de Provence. Finishes with licorice, pepper and perfect size. The best wine in Robertson's portfolio.",Spain,Red Blend
"Good berry aromas come with a hint of spice. It feels peppy and high toned, with a zesty, quick rush of black cherry and plum flavors. It finishes in a flash, leaving little in its wake.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Thick and pasty smelling, this has roasted berry scents that are slightly leathery. It's scratchy and mildly astringent on the palate, tasting minty and dry, with a mild fruit content. The finish is chunky and resiny.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Years ago Rívola was one of Spain's standout value wines; but over time it has devolved. This version is mulchy and muddled, with heavy roasted fruit and red pepper aromas. The palate is grabby, rubbery and roasted, and raisiny notes work their way onto the flavor profile and finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Creamy and confected on the nose, which is proof of the “roble” designation. The palate is rather narrow and acidic, with semi-sour flavors of berry and cherry. Cleansing and tart; decent but doesn't go beyond that.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells like bath soap, then turns grassy and burnt. Tannic and medicinal in the mouth, although better as it airs out. Tastes and feels overdone and super sweet.",Spain,Garnacha
"Decent mass-produced Ribera del Duero. Strawberry and raspberry aromas lean you in the red fruit direction, and the palate is scouring, acidic and full of cherry fruit. Fresh on the finish and hard, but at least it doesn't have off flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Austere, green aromas are about as much as one can pull from the nose, while the palate is fresh and acidic, but lean. Flavors of lime, citrus and pith are zesty at first but pithy later on. Dull and strained, but not bad for Chardonnay from central Spain.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Young wild berry, cherry, rubber and cheese aromas lead to a big, rubbery, loud palate of plum and raspberry. Herbal notes, moderate sweetness and simplicity wrap it up.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Too sour, strained and vegetal to rally behind. The nose is grassy and green, while the palate tastes of sour apple, gooseberry and lemon. Turns citric, mustardy and a little like asparagus on the finish.",Spain,Chardonnay
"A nice, floral, medium-bodied Rioja that should not steer anyone wrong. The nose is harmonized and not overpowering, while the feel is good and easy and the flavors of berry, plum and mild chocolaty oak work well together. Holds its line on the finish as well.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Broad, bold and buttery, with aromas of toasted white peach, flower blossom, vanilla and mild oxidation. The blend is 65% Viura with Malvasia and white Garnacha, and overall it's a round, stout, creamy wine with apple, vanilla and toasty, resiny flavors and finishing notes. A little heavy and sticky but nice for barrel-aged white Rioja.",Spain,White Blend
"Floral lilac and plum aromas greet you, followed by a chunky, frothy palate with crisp core acidity and toasty flavors of baked cherry and caramel. Finishes smooth and long, with peppery notes and dryness.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Ripe berry, mild raisin and overall clarity define the bouquet. This offers a full, complete mouthfeel, with structure and layers of roasted berry, spice and integrated herb. It's sturdy and long on the satisfying finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Solid cherry and berry aromas are smooth and appealing, while a spot of pinched leather adds character to the nose. This feels tight and good, with racy acidity leading a red plum flavor to a dry, tight finish. Nice in a no-nonsense way.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Tobacco and clove aromas ride high on the mildly leafy bouquet. It feels round, juicy, tannic and tight, with mature berry, spice, earth and leather flavors. It remains earthy and mature on the finish, which fades to a blackened, spicy expression with notes of tomato and spice.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is spicy and dry on the nose, with a cheesy accent. It feels medium in body, with sharp acidity that creates a semisour flavor profile of red plum and cherry. Not overly flavorful, it concludes with a crisp, cleansing finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"The cola and licorice aromas are candied and easygoing. This feels acidic and snappy, with red cherry and berry flavors that end with a crisp, sheer, rugged feel.",Spain,Red Blend
"This smells a bit wayward and sulfuric, but it's juicy and acidic on the tongue, with lemony and oily, nutty flavors. It holds steady on the finish, which is lemony in character.",Spain,Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc
"The bouquet is dry, briney and otherwise neutral. It feels wide and lemony, with flavors of citrus and white fruits. It remains mildly pickled on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Aromas of canned peaches and apricots are about all one can pull from the bouquet. It feels solid and untamed, with juicy flavors that run straight to mango, Dole peach and sweetened papaya. It's short on character and complexity but big on sweet, sticky flavors.",Spain,Moscatel
"Smells like a kirsch liqueur on the bouquet. The palate, somewhat surprisingly, is much sharper than the nose, with tangy, zesty flavors of red fruits that some might adore and others will label too thin and sour. Sheer but fresh on the finish, with pulsing acidity. Personally, I find this rather sharp and wanting, given the origin.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Delicate and lithe Sauvignon Blanc from Navarra? Interesting. Tastes sort of Galician due to its clean, tropical pineapple, citrus and green apple flavors. Like a fruit salad with more acidity; doesn't taste particularly Sauvignon-ish, but likable nonetheless.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Rusty colored and flat on the nose. Aromas of medicinal fruit and horse hide are less than stellar, and the soupy palate of weak raspberry and faux sweetness doesn't do much to improve things. Needs more vitality and overall quality.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Starts with nutty, oily, acrid aromas, and never is there much fruit character. The palate has bite but still seems short on acidity, and the flavors run toward funky citrus, asparagus and green beans. On the global scale of SB, this doesn't really cut it.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Generic fruit, hard rubber, olive and leather on the nose. Dry and tannic, with bitter black plum and a rock-hard finish. Tough and just not that much fun to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"One of the strangest-smelling wines we've encountered from Spain: there's forced cinnamon, heavy funk, dampness and other unfamiliar, foreign scents. The palate has weight and a gritty feeel, while the core flavors are Sherried. Hard to see the appeal here.",Spain,Red Blend
"Funky, sour, gumball aromas and flavors, and then not a whole lot else. Short on character, with little to make note of other than sweaty berry flavors, tartness and bramble.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit earthy and leafy on the nose and palate, with lightweight strawberry and raspberry aromas and flavors. The wine has a clacky, almost metallic feel to it along with hints of tobacco and green bean. Vanilla and sweetness push the finish, which is also slightly green. Hails from Cádiz in southwestern Spain.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"A steal for six bucks; the nose is floral and black, but under control. Meanwhile, the palate is bouncy, round and balanced, with juicy black plum and wild berry flavors. Clean and solid.",Spain,Grenache
"Pink meets orange in terms of hue, while the nose gives a nice blend of sweet and snappy berry and citrus. The palate has a little weight and heft along with dry, white-peppery flavors of nectarine and apricot. Pithy, citrusy and healthy throughout. Good wine for the money.",Spain,Rosé
"Sort of scratchy and generic on the nose, with reasonably fresh red fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is angular and clipped by piercing acidity, while the flavors are of nice but regular black cherry and plum. Fairly juicy and fresh as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Buttercup and fresh pear aromas are friendly and inviting. It feels full and correct, with good acids and minerality. Flavors of pears, melons and lees are very nice, while the finish is simultaneously flowery, crisp and salinic.",Spain,Albariño
"The green fruit and subtle, yeasty hay aromas are inviting. It feels nice and not abrasive, with notes of dried apple, citrus and rich, toasty yeast. It perks up on the finish, with dryness, zest and complexity. Very nice for $15.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Pure apple and peach aromas are the calling card of a good Albariño, and Pazo de Senorans always has that and a little more. The '08 seems a touch less concentrated and leesy than prior years, but it's still showing all the marine-influenced personality, beauty and elegance of a no-oak, seafood-friendly winner. Drink right away; it's not meant for keeping. Imported by European Cellars.",Spain,Albariño
"Rubber, flower petal and candied fruit aromas comprise the unique bouquet. The palate is solid but edgy, bearing grabby tannins and heaviness, with sweet flavors of blackberry, cassis and pepper. Monotone on the finish, then bitter at the very end. This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is sharp smelling, with aromas of field greens, rhubarb and scratchy spices. It's light in weight, with short, herbal and spicy flavors that center on a strawberry note.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This has a reedy red-berry aroma and a citrus note. Confirmation of the bouquet comes on the palate, which is lean and scouring, with red plum, pomegranate and herb flavors. The finish is cleansing, but it doesn't show much substance.",Spain,Alicante Bouschet
"There's virtually no bouquet to this wine, and the palate follows suit with a flat feel and hollow, faded flavors of balsamic-doused cherry and herb. It seems aged and dried out.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A jammy raspberry aroma comes with milk chocolate and plastic scents. It feels pulpy yet spunky, with red plum and strawberry flavors. The mild finish doesn't evolve or expand, but it registers as being fresh.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty and yeasty on the nose, this has an eggy, sweaty note. It feels good but drifts a bit on the palate, while the flavors run stalky and sweet, with a touch of apple for crispness.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Gaseous and minerally on first blush, it has funky, earthy aromas of leaves and olive that could use a hit of freshness. It feels grabby and scratchy, with an olive flavor and a hot finish that has a latex-like character. This is a big wine that misses some elegance.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dry, herbal aromas mix with a light cherry perfume and lemon peel. The palate is a bit sharp but it's clean and fresh, with dry, crisp cherry flavors mixing with hints of coffee and black pepper. Finishes light and dry; a tapas wine for sure.",Spain,Red Blend
"Nice violet and minerally aromas mix with sweet berry scents, and right then you know you have a competent, correct Garnacha on your hands. It's a bit acidic and bouncy, but the flavors of berry and plum are firm, tasty and fade well on the finish. A fresh and zesty wine for near-term drinking.",Spain,Garnacha
"Hard and roasted on the nose, with molasses, leather and other less-than-fruity aromas. It's narrow and clampy in the mouth, with herbal, distant flavors of peppery red fruits. Shows some roughness and tannic bite on the finish, and also a bit of stemminess. Good but for the price and vintage it has some weaknesses.",Spain,Red Blend
"Peach and melon aromas are inviting and clean. Very juicy and juice-like in the mouth, probably more so than I can remember for this wine. It tastes like orange, tangerine and grapefuit juices mixed together. The texture isn't very smooth or wine-like; seems less refined and less minerally than in the past.",Spain,Godello
"Like most base-level Garnachas, this one has a sweet, candied aromatic cover. But unlike many it has depth, purity and avoids boring, offensive sweetness. The flavors of raspberry and boysenberry are bright, and it maintains balance and integrity through the finish. A nice wine for under $10.",Spain,Grenache-Syrah
"Aromas of cedar cigar box, subtle flower, spice and dry berry form a good bouquet. Searing acidity creates some sharpness, while the primary flavors of berry and plum are offset by red tomato and dry spice. Roasted, dry, spicy and slightly bitter on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Apple and other white fruit aromas come with hints of sea foam and clam shell. The palate is tight, mineral-driven and citric, with some spritz. Flavors of apple and pithy citrus lead to a long, speedy finish, with generous acidity.",Spain,Albariño
"This has a scent of baked apple, and in the mouth, it seems just as much a still white wine as a Cava, with a soft bead that indicates that it's starting to lose steam. Flavors of melon, citrus and pineapple finish with vanilla and chunky weight.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Rusty and light in color, this has earth, compost and root notes, with dry leather aromas. It feels good, with an easy, mature flow and light flavors of dried fruit, spice, pepper and vanilla. Lengthy, it features tobacco and toast flavors on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Berry and dark plum aromas accompany tobacco, spice and baking spice notes. This feels mostly fresh and vital, with drying tannins and a firm build. It tastes deep and earthy, with berry and herb notes and flavors of coffee and black tea. It turns peppery and chocolaty on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big, smoky and charred, with a rubbery blackberry note lurking in the background, it feels chewy, thick and dense, with a roasted black-fruit flavor, a baking spice note and a toasted, rooty aftertaste that suggests root beer.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Another good bubbly from Sonim, this red-colored sparkler is dry on the nose, with cherry and cassis aromas. It feels round and full as it shows off bright raspberry and plum flavors in front of a healthy, smooth finish. Much darker in color than most rosé Cavas.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is punchy and full of potent black-fruit aromas that turn jammy upon airing. It feels lush, thick and chewy, with ripe, dense berry flavors that come with plenty of young oak. Creamy in feel, it features vanilla and resin flavors on the finish. Modern and chunky in style.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Controlled, expressive and impressive for Garnacha. Dark fruit and dark spice are the lead actors, while the supporting cast includes a lush feel and good length. Frankly this is a delicious, well-made Garnacha that pours on the black fruit and brown sugar. Dense and balanced from start to finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Roasted and stalky smelling, this has earthy berry and tomato aromas. It feels a bit flat, with a stewed, saucy red-berry flavor. The finish is adequate, with oak-based clove and herb notes.",Spain,Monastrell
"Stewy yet flush, with shearing acids, this has a meaty, leafy aroma that sets up the angular palate. Flavors of stewed berry, spiced tomato and burnt leaves turn slightly bitter on what amounts to a short finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A leathery, herbal aroma outmuscles the distant berry and cherry scents. It feels hard and high in acidity, with raspberry and snappy red-plum flavors. It's citrusy and crisp on the finish, with lasting tang.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark in color, with a heavy, semiflat nose that is sort of gaseous. Airing brings it out of its slumber, unveiling medium-bright dark fruit, schisty mineral and spice flavors. Finishes chunky, with some fire, heat and bitter chocolate. Good but not as lively and precise as the great ones from Priorato.",Spain,Red Blend
"Nice Tempranillo for $10. Paso a Paso opens with blackberry, boysenberry and other black-fruit aromas. But it's composed and doesn't smell artificial or candied. In the mouth, the wine is tannic, tight and brawny, with no shortage of berry and plum flavors. Big, generous and great for those looking for a lot of fruit and simplicity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Slightly volatile and jammy, but still good for the price range. The nose is pungent and mildly prickly, but it settles in the long run. Like most RDDs, it's intense and jammy in the mouth, with concentration and flavors of raspberry, tomato, salad dressing and even chocolate. If all this sounds a bit scattered and all over the map, it is. But as a whole, the wine has composure, mouthfeel and varietal and regional character.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Round and lemony on the nose, with apple and minerality. The palate is juicy and fresh, with dry, angular pineapple and lemon flavors. Short and acidic in the mouth, but fresh and clean throughout. This is Basque white wine, take it or leave it.",Spain,White Blend
"The first act of dried spices and light, dusty red fruit aromas is honest and subdued. The palate brings good weight and lightly leafy, tomatoey accents to red cherry and raspberry flavors. Light, dry and a little stemmy on the finish. Standard but hinting at elegant.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fresh and fruity on the nose, and inviting for what it is: a basic Garnacha with color, spirit and lots of blackberry and plum flavors. The palate is tight and rubbery, but overall this is a fine value despite its short, simple finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Composed, balanced and with all the dots connected; this is what we like about basic, affordable Rioja. It's fleshy yet fresh, with snappy cherry and raspberry flavors accented by a wave of vanilla that continues onto the finish. Blends good flavors, weight and acidic crispness.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Pungent and sweaty smelling on first blush, almost suggesting Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. It remains oily and nettled on the nose, with sharpness. Sooner rather than later it softens, unveiling flavors of green melon, passionfruit and citrus. And the finish goes out with snap, orange and grapefruit. Potent for the variety.",Spain,Albariño
"A little gritty and tough on the nose, with hard strawberry and kirsch aromas. The palate is voluminous and foamy, with flavors of burnt blood orange and grilled pink grapefruit. Yes, there's a hard, burnt element to the wine, but this being Pinot Noir from Penedès that's to be expected.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Mineral-driven and hard on the nose, this features toasty, smoky, chocolaty notes in addition to medicinal berry aromas. It feels juicy but also resiny and creamy, with plum and wood flavors that finish long. This is a ripe, fruity wine with plenty of oak, size and body.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is toasty, earthy and full on the nose, with bacon and floral blackberry aromas. It feels structured and firm, with baked, chewy flavors of roasted berry, smoked meat and coffee, and it maintains its core flavors on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is modern in style and well stocked for an affordable Rioja. It opens with aromas of gritty, roasted berry, plum and grilled beef that lead to a firm palate, with dark fruit, toast, mineral and chocolate flavors. It feels tight, warm and long on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This producer knows how to do Verdejo right. Aromas of citrus, mineral and apple are lucid and fresh. It feels tangy and a touch citric, but not cutting, with lemon and tangerine flavors that set up a minerally, steely, refreshing finish. Best as an apéritif or with oysters or chilled shrimp.",Spain,Verdejo
"Crusty on the nose, this has toast, mineral, leather, berry and cherry aromas. It's concentrated, balanced and firmly tannic on the palate, which carries flavors of blackberry, vanilla and tobacco. Resiny vanilla, herb and peppery spice touches grace the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ginger ale and a touch of powdered sugar give this extra dry Cava its proper sweet aromas. The flavors are solid, if you like candied orange slices and lemon-lime soda. Shows good mouthfeel and more than adequate freshness. Perfectly competent given that it's $9.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The bouquet delivers some of that creamy, corn-like smell that many Cavas show. There is also cereal and citrus to the nose. Flavors of nectarine, grapefruit and green herbs are fresh and in the lead, and the feel is soft-edged. Shows some green bitterness on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Probably not a Cava for wine snobs. But who says all wines have to be super serious and complex? This one shows cured meat, tarragon, sweet tea and Muscat aromas, while the flavors are pure lychee and honeydew. Frothy and sugary, but that's the spumante style. Best with birthday cake, etc.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"From the Freixenet group of wineries, Vionta is clean but more neutral than we'd like to see. You won't be offended by the wine's green apple and lemon flavors, which are wet, fresh and zesty. But you might like a touch more refinement and dimension. A good wine, but a basic one.",Spain,Albariño
"Gets off early with fresh tomato, spiced red plum, tobacco and vanilla aromas. The palate is fine but tight, with herbal fruit flavors, pepper, tomato and sharp acidity. Finishes with olive and tomato notes. Not the sweetest or softest thing going, but good if you like Navarran wines and their patented herbal, red-fruit character.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This barrel-aged white Rioja is as close to Burgundy as you're going to find in Spain. It has a lot of oak throughout, but with vanilla, spice, cinnamon and more it works. Apple, baked citrus and resin from the barrel make it complex and food-worthy, and if you were to serve this with grilled or baked fish you could leave the Montrachet for next time. Imported by Maisons Marques & Domaines USA.",Spain,White Blend
"A deep and dense wine, with coconut and blackberry dominating the weighty, powerful bouquet. This is an organic wine with an explosive palate of berry fruit and plenty of juicy acidity to keep it fresh and healthy. Toast, chocolate and cola are the finishing notes, and overall it's a strapping wine to drink now thru 2013. Imported by Organic Vintners.",Spain,Red Blend
"Yeasty, briney and strange on the nose, this feels clunky, with oily citrus and nut-driven flavors. It's bitter on the finish, and it doesn't show much in the way of mouthfeel. A blend of Chardonnay and Macabeo.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Heavy oak-based aromas provide cover for the grassy, green scents. It feels clunky and grabby, with jumbled flavors of sweet oak and green-leaning fruit.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The nose offers white bread and pancake aromas. It feels angular and acidic, with dry, crisp apple and citrus flavors that finish in a corny, stalky fashion.",Spain,Macabeo
"Dry and overly crisp throughout, this is light and peppery smelling, with notes of oregano and tomato leaf. It feels astringent and dry, with peppery, earthy flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Medicinal and leathery, this has an iodine aroma that takes the luster off the fruit. It feels short and choppy, with medicinal, gritty flavors of vitamin, red berry and red licorice. Juicy but edgy; tasted twice.",Spain,Monastrell
"Intersting up front, with savory, roasted aromas of smoky plum and barbecue. It feels bullish and punishing, bearing monster tannins and heavy extraction, with a roasted, charred flavor that leads to an all-out resiny, burnt-wood-tasting finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells reedy and scratchy, turning more herbal with time in the glass. Astringent acids create a sharp mouthfeel, and while the flavors include raspberry and strawberry, there's also a weedy component that picks up speed as the wine breathes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells cheesy and tomatoey, with a woody accent. Clampy, resiny and drying on the palate, this has lean tea and cherry flavors that are complemented by a dull oak tone. The finish is minty and resiny tasting, but hollow in feel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy and candied smelling, this has a green element akin to alfalfa or mint. It's clampy, tannic and high in acid, with raspberry and plum notes that offer an oak offset. The flavors turn tangy and sharp on the finish, even as a heavy vanilla flavor settles in.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is neutral on the nose except for a hint of white flower and peach. It's snappy but basic feeling, with a stalky apple flavor. It finishes dry and lemony, with a corny flavor.",Spain,Airen
"Attractive background aromas like nutmeg and licorice are taken down a notch by front-running bramble and pickled notes, while the palate is hard, tannic and spunky as it delivers lively cherry, raspberry and chocolate flavors. A good wine with RDD pedigree, but also sort of grabby and rough, with coffee and pepper on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Barrantes is always a full-bodied Albariño from one of Rias Baixas's warmest subzones. The nose on the '07 is of doughnuts and pastry, with sweet pear kicking in. The flavors are peach, apricot and ripe citrus fruits, and the finish is pithy and wide. Plods along a bit; could stand to be lighter and smoother in scope.",Spain,Albariño
"A warm and earthy wine with baked dark-fruit aromas covered in a blanket of fully toasted oak. This bruiser, like its brothers, is all-out Garnacha. It carries a stated 15.5% alcohol, and the flavors are of roasted black plum, blackberry and wood. More lively than the reserve-level wines from Alto Moncayo, but still hard, demanding and heavy. 500 cases made.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dusty and plump up front, with a hint of melon. The palate is round and easygoing, with moderate acidity supporting baked apple and melon flavors. On the finish it's pithy and slightly bitter, but for the most part it holds onto its form and freshness.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Barrel toast is front and center on the creamy, vanilla-laden bouquet. This white Garnacha features good body and balance, but the barrel influence is unavoidable and dominant. Resiny, toasty and showing some apple along the way.",Spain,Grenache Blanc
"Broad, dark and meaty, with aromas of leather and beef broth. The palate comes on as bulky and tannic, but the flavors are full and deep even if they are also a touch soupy and meaty. Good for a 2008 midlevel RDD, but nothing to get excited over.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big and sort of disinterested for Albariño, with a clipped, citrusy palate that's choppy, salinic and green. There's green melon and minerality here, but for a new-vintage wine it seems middling in its focus and intensity.",Spain,Albariño
"Recommended with caution. The sample this note is based on was weighty and smooth, with apple and floral notes and then an almosty buttery palate with baked apple and citrus flavors. Oddly, it's a soft, ripe wine that's fading and not showing much Sauvignon Blanc typicity.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Starts with peppery, leafy aromas that morph toward dry and earthy. The palate, like with all of Torres' basic '07 wines, is crisp and acidic, which brings tang to the wine's red cherry and plum flavors. Spicy, peppery and fresh on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Seems more earthy and damp than you might expect, with minerally notes. Sort of fiery and rugged on the palate, with tough tannins and only modest roundness and richness for a reserva-level wine from a good vintage. Shows some bitter chocolate on the finish. Needs another year in bottle to show better.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Minty black cherry aromas give it a solid opening, but there's also some mild cleanser and paint scents to the nose. The palate is basic, snappy, fresh and carries good weight, while the flavors are sweet, berry-oriented and softened by vanilla. A good Grenache with good balance.",Spain,Garnacha
"Chunky, jammy and full of blackberry and boysenberry aromas, this is lively but limited in mouthfeel, with wild berry and savory flavors. It feels pointed and short on the finish, but overall it's dark, full and well made.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean and fresh, this features largely neutral, mineral-driven aromas that hint at white fruit and melon. Citrus, particularly white grapefruit, is the lead flavor, while background notes of pith, melon and green banana make appearances. Fresh, crisp and nice on the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Applesauce, lime and mineral aromas comprise the shy bouquet on this Cava. It feels round yet alive, with crisp apple and peach flavors. Citrus-driven acidity comes out on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Firm, gritty aromas of minerally black cherry and plum precede a palate that sizzles with bold, scouring acidity. It tastes woody, resiny and reasonably fruity, with forceful acids creating a tangy, zesty finish. Drink 2013–2017.",Spain,Red Blend
"The nose delivers a light but perceptible blast of sucking candy, children's vitamin and perfume aromas. The palate shows additional candied characteristics, but for the most part it's fresh and easy, with a good feel. Generic as a whole, but competent and satisfying.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The smell of honey and lemon-lime soda give this a basic but respectable opening. It's sort of foamy and plump in the mouth, with apple and green-herb flavors. Lacks a little touch but offers bouncy fruit and no overt faults. Imported by Winelink Imports.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The neon pink color is a dead giveaway that Garnacha is the basis of this rosé. Smells spunky and quite fresh on the nose, with a touch of bubble-gum sweetness. Flavors of raspberry and cotton candy catch the tart and sweet sides of things, so overall it's offering a little of everything. Drink now.",Spain,Rosé
"A little aggressive out of the chute, with a nose that's sort of raspy. The fruit on the palate is tangy and tastes like early picked nectarines with a lemon twist. Crisp and short, but very clean and focused.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Salmon-colored and dense, with aromas of clay, cherry and brown sugar. Pinot Noir-ish in its smoky, dried-berry palate and peppery finish. Robust, solid and with texture.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Age is beginning to show up on this gran reserva. It's a little raisiny and Sherried on the nose, while the palate is wiry but not exactly thin, with dry raspberry, pie cherry and plum skin flavors. Baked bean, caramel, vanilla and tobacco all play big roles on the finish, which is scouring and tight. Drink now; it's probably not going to improve with further age.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of cherry-chocolate and rubber are firm and a little closed. And such a bouquet doesn't really portend a flavor profile dominated by pink grapefruit and tight citrus. But that's really where this Cava rests: in the mouth, it's single-mindedly about pink grapefruit, which is fine if that's a flavor you like.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Savory and deep given the price, with dark color, obvious ripeness and even a touch of vanilla and mocha on the nose. Round in the mouth and immensely fruity, with plum and berry flavors blending with vanilla. Textured and medium-long on the finish. Good for everyday quaffing, especially in the cold fall and winter months.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nothing if not stout and fruity. This is a big, modern Syrah with a mountain's worth of plum, berry and currant character on the nose, palate and finish. The acidity is a bit jagged and amplified, which creates some crispness, tension and pop. But overall it's a burly specimen that despite 20 months in oak does not taste woody. Drink or hold until 2012. Imported by Kobrand.",Spain,Syrah
"This is rusty in color, with burnt leaf and dried earth aromas. Drying and hard on the palate, it has an earthy, leafy set of strained red-fruit flavors. Bitter and rough on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A sappy wild-berry aroma turns mulchy with airing. The palate feels sharp and puckery, with very high acidity that creates short, tart, ultrajuicy raspberry and red plum flavors.",Spain,Red Blend
"Spice and tire rubber aromas shadow hard, dry berry scents. It feels bumpy and scattershot, with a pasty, oaky flavor and fiery acidity. The finish is overly oaky and invasive.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Right from the start things are stretched thin. It smells raw and feels dilute, with flavors of sour plum and a bit of wood resin. Fiery and tart on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Cherry and plum aromas lead to a choppy, rubbery-feeling palate. It tastes soupy, herbal and briney.",Spain,Bobal
"Berry and plum aromas come with hints of smoke and asphalt. The very high acidity creates a shearing mouthfeel, and the flavors never evolve past tart red plum and cranberry.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is on its last legs. It smells maderized, flat and candied, then feels heavy and drying. It tastes and smells old, finishing bitter.",Spain,Rosé
"Fondillón represents the pinnacle of red Spanish dessert wines, and the 1999 vintage just might make your jaw drop. Subtle but expansive on the nose, with a blend of baked dark-fruit and cinnamon aromas, it is liquid heaven in the mouth, with excellent balance and flavors of roasted plums, black cherry, nutmeg and chocolate. This is pure, structured and outstanding from start to finish. Drink now or hold in a proper cellar for another 10 or 20 years. 100 cases made.",Spain,Monastrell
"Quite standard but that doesn't mean it isn't a good wine and doesn't fit a purpose. For regular, everyday Rioja this should not fail. It has nice cherry and plum aromas with a hint of rubber and tobacco. Licorice, plum, raspberry and brown sugar flavors work the balanced, controlled palate, while the finish is natural and unforced. 235,000 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This ranks as a good no-frills white wine from central Spain. Viura is at its best when it's crisp, clean and tastes like apples and honeydew. And for the most part, that's exactly what this is. There's freshness and scour, but it's not acidic or sharp. Still, best to drink it as soon as possible.",Spain,Viura
"Yellow in color, with honeyed peach aromas. There is no indication of oak, but it probably went through extended lees aging, which explains the wine's richer melon, apricot and honey flavors. Almost Chardonnay-like in body and weight, but with more tropical, tree-fruit flavors and aromas. Drink immediately; it's on the way out.",Spain,Verdejo
"Bramble and brine are present on the nose, and while 2005 was a very good vintage in Rioja, this wine brings a little less than expected. It's endowed with snappy red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, and there's also vanilla and herbal notes. The feel is dry, medium-bodied and grabby, with a hint of stemmy snap.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Can't call this an elevated or complex wine, but we can say that it's big and bold, with plum, berry and dill aromas. In the mouth, it's not overly vocal but it is fulfilling. Flavors of plum, vanilla and aged cheese are nice, while coconut comes up on the finish. A wine to drink without contemplation.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A touch of volatility accompanies opening black fruit and plum aromas, while the palate brings both a raisiny essence and austere acidity that causes tartness. For basic Priorat, this is fine. But if you're looking for greatness, there isn't much to speak of. Overall, it's a good but regular wine, nothing more or less.",Spain,Red Blend
"A perennial Best Buy, Sangre de Toro always delivers a quality red-wine experience that does not bowl you over. Here the aromas are light and jammy, with strawberry. The body is medium in weight and intensity, with pure but basic cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. Like all other parts of the wine, the finish is easy and clean, with carry-over flavors of berry fruit.",Spain,Red Blend
"Opens with sweet fruit aromas, a whiff of oak and red candy, while the mouthfeeel is juicy and mostly fresh, with clean fruit flavors and more than adequate ripeness and sweetness. Fresh, composed and pleasant in the scheme of things.",Spain,Red Blend
"Reddish in color, with solid aromas of tire rubber, cherry and plum. The palate shows fine lift and balance, and the flavors of juicy, slightly pithy and bitter raspberry and plum are just right for Navarran Garnacha-based rosé. Drink soon with salads and finger foods.",Spain,Rosé
"Crisp, natural and lightly salinic on the nose, with medium weight, good freshness and solid peach and citrus flavors. This is a standard but nicely done Rioja rosé with a pithy finish and just the right edge to it. Drink liberally with appetizers and you shouldn't go wrong.",Spain,Rosé
"More basic and strained than prior wines from this producer. The nose is rubbery and cheesy at first, with leather and blackberry. Hard, tannic and acidic as well, and only a little softer with airing. Flavors are of snappy, tough cherry and berry, and the finish shows tannic bite. Could improve some with aging; now it's a tough go.",Spain,Grenache
"Kicks off with minty coconut aromas and prune, then a hint of creamy green. The palate shows proper acidity and tannin balance, so the framing for the wine's raspberry flavors is good. Grabby but fresh on the finish, with just enough grapey richness.",Spain,Garnacha
"Roasted and fiery on the nose, this wine has red fruit aromas mixed with green, herbal notes. It feels racy and pumped up with acidity, which drives the wine's core flavors of red plum, herb and vanilla. It's fresh but slightly abrasive and herbal throughout. This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Tempranillo, in descending order.",Spain,Red Blend
"Earthy, inky, sweet and jammy on the nose, this brings just the right hint of raisin. It feels narrow and firmly tannic, with wide flavors of blackberry, prune, raisin and chocolate. It's loaded with flavor, but the mouthfeel is astringent and collapsed. A powerful country-style wine.",Spain,Garnacha
"Active on the bouquet, this features mint, baking spice, clove and ripe berry aromas. It feels plump and round, with a mildly candied flavor profile that includes blackberry, herb, and nutmeg. It turns a little rooty on the finish, suggesting licorice nibs. A blend of 65% Garnacha and 35% Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"A touch scratchy and rough on the nose, with pepper and leathery fruit aromas. The palate keeps that edge while offering peppery berry flavors and oak. More tannic and woody than one might hope for, with lactic notes on the finish. Shows flashes but comes up average. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Garnacha
"Silly name but pretty good wine. A tidal wave of cherry/berry aromas is authentic, natural, youthful and floral. The palate is just as bright and bouncy, with red fruit running away with things. A touch of mineral and chocolate at the end gives it some darkness to match the vibrancy.",Spain,Monastrell
"Even though it's a sweet-styled Cava, the nose kicks up lemon and apple aromas that are familiar as can be. The palate, however, is quite sweet and supports the Semi Dry labeling. Candied but not sticky, with a slightly chalky finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Ultra purple and sort of gummy and confected. But it's also pretty solid in the mouth, with tannin instead of flatness holding things together. Tastes like sweet dark plums and candy, while a hint of black coffee darkness enters on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The Borsao brand is a bargain pioneer, and while the wines aren't $4.99 anymore they are still squarely “value” oriented. This rosé is fairly steely and fresh, with pithy grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Lean and peppery on the finish, and ready to be consumed right away.",Spain,Rosé
"Already in the twilight of its lifespan, this is a friendly rosé with a little wiggle and kick. The palate sits on ripe nectarine and pink grapefruit, while the finish offers pepper and spice. A little pithy but pretty good if you get at it soon.",Spain,Rosé
"Big and dark, and it comes with no shortage of prune, blackberry, smoky oak and depth. A lusty flavor profile filled with blackberry, cola, clove and chocolate is stout and satisfying, while the dark finish sports licorice and bitter cacao. Forthright and chunky wine. Drink now into 2011. Imported by Fine Estates From Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is incredibly inviting on the bouquet due to aromas of leather, raisin, tea and mocha. It feels lifted, benefiting from the superb structure and tannins, while the flavors of leathery berry, coffee, toast and chocolate are outstanding. This is pure, deep, elegant and impeccably balanced Tempranillo. Drink now–2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"More red than dark, with semisweet aromas of candy, strawberry and a bit of grassy green. The palate is easygoing and creamy, with milk chocolate and berry flavors along with overt wood-driven spice. Finishes with drying tannins, another wave of oak and just enough snap to keep it moving in the right direction. Good but not great by Priorat standards.",Spain,Red Blend
"Nobody should mistake this idiosyncratic Basque white wine for a bargain. At $25, you had better like steely, almost sour-style whites to justify going here. But if you can find the pleasure in Txakoli, then this one is good. It has peach and nectarine aromas, which are backed by tangy lemon and pineapple flavors. Naturally sharp and cleansing on the finish, and thus good for seafood tapas and the like.",Spain,White Blend
"Young, jumpy and slightly candied, but that's just fine given the price range it's playing in. To get old-vines Garnacha for a song is not uncommon, yet this wine's thick, fruity palate goes beyond the norm. And with a round mouthfeel built on light-framed tannins, it's easygoing as can be. Drink now, but don't put it under the microscope.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dusty and dry smelling, with apple and lettuce on the nose. Flavors of green apple are glazed with spice and cinnamon, while the finish leans on papaya and pretty good mouthfeel and texture. Very basic but solid. Drink now.",Spain,Viura
"A little bit strange and unusual on the nose, with roasted meat, young oak, popcorn and only modest fruit aromas. The palate shows pointed cherry, chocolate and some mushroom, while the finish and mouthfeel are shy and not all that substantive. For basic Ribera this is good, but that's as far as it goes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dark and crusty on the nose, with cola, raisin and foresty dampness. The palate has wintergreen along with solid black cherry flavors, while accents of pepper and licorice give it a dark side. Finishes a bit grating and tannic, with espresso-like bitterness. Overall it's a good but not overwhelming wine from the hidden Valencia D.O. 70% Tempranillo and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromas of pure cherry are pointed but clean. That more or less describes the wine, which hits with sharp acidity but also good, slightly roasted flavors of cherry and plum. Finishes short, firm and a touch grating.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stony apple aromas are mostly neutral and lead to a fleshy, semisoft palate with citrus, kiwi and notes of oxidation. Nice and easy but sort of plump and bland. The finish indicates that it's starting to bend and will break sooner rather than later. Drink now.",Spain,Godello
"Whets the whistle with floral aromas of jasmine, talcum powder and banana. The palate is juicy, tight and citrusy in feel, with lime and kiwi flavors. A light wine for fresh foods and simple summer settings.",Spain,White Blend
"Grapey and potent as Rioja crianzas go, with a medium-to-full-sized palate that's full of bright acidity and standard but solid berry fruit flavors. It's the slightest bit creamy and thick on the finish, but overall it's about as middle of the road as any wine on the market.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Very light in body, color and aromas. The nose is punchy and a bit sharp, and so is the palate, which offers crisp, bracing acids to highlight zesty, lean nectarine and tangerine flavors. Quite linear and citric, but experience with this wine says it shows best with food.",Spain,Rosé
"Soda pop-like on the nose, with a clear reference to Sprite and 7Up. The palate is somewhat candied and simple, but it has good feel and the flavors of lemon-lime are likable. Mild on the finish, with flavors that extend from the lemon-lime bouquet and palate.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A chunky wine with compost, coffee and leather on the nose. The palate holds onto that chunkiness with clumsy flatness that goes with herbal plum and berry flavors. Airing allows it to unfold and find a better place, but always does it seem heavy and on the murky side.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The opening of smoke, rubber and black cherry comes across as being dark and good. The palate holds form with lively cherry, plum and currant flavors and finally a medium-long, somewhat warm and meaty finish. Good for an everyday, no-frills Garnacha.",Spain,Grenache
"Starts out muddled and murky, and eventually settles on rich, raisiny and slightly stewed. Seeing that this is Toro, some overripeness is almost a given, and thus the black fruit and licorice flavors are expected. Finishes warm, toasty and short, with a candied hollowness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Piercing to start, with leathery, bacony and campfire aromas. Saturated, although healthy, if a bit hard and tannic. Flavors of bacon and clove are right up there with black fruit and syupy richness, and clove carries onto the finish. Needs time to breathe and unfold; 65% Garnacha and 35% Syrah.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"Opens with bright, popping cherry aromas that are straightforward, much like the rest of the show. The palate is regular and healthy in feel, with standard cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes the slightest bit toasty and warm. Nice but basic Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is dense yet fresh, with dark berry and mild earth aromas. It feels lively, forceful and solidly built, with blackberry, creamy chocolate, toast and spice flavors that are all in equal, balanced portions. Long and warm on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"A bit of forward oak comes across on the nose, while mocha and pretty good berry fruit keep things focused. Like most Navarran wines, this is snappy and “red” in character, with herbal tomato and plum flavors. Classic finishing notes of olive and dill close things out.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A typically reserved Navarran wine is what this is. The nose offers dry red fruit, spice and not much else. The palate is mildly citric and herbal, but there's enough cherry and leather to carry things to a medium-length   finish of dill, vanilla and spice. A nice and simple food wine.",Spain,Red Blend
"A little creamy, waxy and scattershot, but also far more exotic and different than most $8 wines. This is barrel-fermented Viura, but the oak level is light and manageable. Flavors of papaya, melon and citrus are almost tropical in scope, and the finish is pretty fresh. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",Spain,Viura
"Fresh, pure and minerally, with lime and peach aromas. This is a fine Viura that is lively, balanced and flavorful. The citrus and apple flavors ring true, and the mouthfeel isn't raw or jumpy. Instead, a mineral and chalk element smooths it out, and overall it sings. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Spain,Viura
"Full and clean, with a bright nose of cherry, plum and pepper. This is full-bodied, with extract and tannic bite. But the flavors of berry and plum are solid and round, while burnt-toast notes darken up the finish. Lots of snap and focus. Modern and ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"Good value for a bear of a wine. It's 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet, and it certainly has teeth. Stocky aromas of blackberry, bacon and tobacco are inviting, while the palate is saturated, tannic and full of black fruit, bacon and brown sugar. Finishes with weight and coffee/chocolate flavors. Not a shy wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A big set of roasted aromas includes hints of smoke, mineral, bacon and black fruit. The palate is balanced and lifted by proper acidity, so the black-fruit flavors do not come across as heavy or cooked. Savory stuff, with vanilla and herb accents on a firm, long finish. Good structure; well-made wine.",Spain,Tinta Fina
"Even in a marginal vintage, you should expect a true and polished taste of Toro from Maurodos's Prima label. Blackberry, cherry and plum aromas are bonded by light balsam-like oak, while the palate is structured and delivers plenty of ripe black fruit. Chocolate and pepper on the finish seem right for the wine, which nails the Toro style even if it isn't a blockbuster. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Modern and bulky, this has a lot of great things going on. It opens with aromas of mineral, graphite, sage and bold berry, with chewy, roasted black-fruit flavors. It's long, compact, chocolaty and spicy on the finish. Still not mature but it's drinkable—best from 2014 and on.",Spain,Carignan
"Hard to say who this wine is made for; must be the old schooler who likes lightness and elegance. Starts with gritty, rooty, mature aromas of tobacco and leaves, with red fruit scents mixed in. The palate is light but right, with elegant cherry and raspberry flavors that are not dark or heavy. Fades with vanilla and tobacco notes. Drink right away.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A wine with faults and a few positives. On the nose, it's roasted almost to the point of being overdone. It smells like baked fruit, roasted peanuts and tire tread. Doesn't sound great, does it? But in the mouth its more true and recognizable; flavors of tomato leaf, dried red fruit, vanilla and dill are known entities, while the finish is long and draped with even more dill weed. Drink now. This is not one to save.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With lime, citrus and other linear aromas, this is nothing if not fresh. The palate is scouring and spritzy, and swishing it across the tongue will create a sudsy mouthfeel. Amid that there are tangy lime and pear flavors, and then a cleansing finish. Best with anchovies and other sea-based appetizers. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, Imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,White Blend
"Lots of color but quiet and shy, with only minimal expressiveness throughout. The palate offers just one level of baked-fruit flavors, but no variance or complexity. And in the end it's clean and solid, but more amorphous and monotone than you'd hope for given the price. 70% Monastrell and 30% Cab Franc is the blend; 160 cases made.",Spain,Red Blend
"A little gaseous and funky on the nose, but that's common for inexpensive Garnacha. Once it unfolds, it deals saturated, chunky black-fruit flavors, a jammy mouthfeel and fatness on the finish. It isn't all that structured, but it doesn't lack for size. Maybe a touch green at its core, but given the price that's not a major fault.",Spain,Garnacha
"Kind of a downer given past performances of this label and the high quality of the '05 harvest. Seems overly roasted and earthy, with rubbery, drawn aromas that don't seem fully fresh. The palate is heavy, with cooked, leathery flavors of berry and fig. Finishes in similar fashion, with dull bitter flavors and leather.",Spain,Red Blend
"Waxy peach aromas seem slightly oxidized. It's round and citrusy on the palate, but in a monotone way that fades to pithy white fruits and mealy citrus. Shows some flashes of uniqueness and class; mostly it's wayward and slightly bitter.",Spain,Tempranillo Blanco
"Sweet and mildly candied on the bouquet, and then it clamps down firmly in the mouth with hard Cabernet tannins and lightly herbal, candied flavors of medicinal black cherry. Decent but not special; finishes sticky and candied.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dry, lightweight and peppery, but zesty, fresh and clean. The body is streamlined to the point of being lean, but the raspberry and cherry flavors, while also thin like a runway model, are crisp and legit. Tart, tasty and simple red wine.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Powerful but not real precise, especially as the earthy, tight nose unveils itself. The mouthfeel is tight, narrow and tannic, yet the flavors are big and meaty, and also sort of generic in terms of berry flavors. Medium-length and rough on the finish, with lasting acidic bite.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Husky on the nose but mostly it comes across as wild, with jumpy, loud pear, melon and apple aromas. The mouth is spunky and all over the map, while flavors of tangy yellow fruits carry an acidic, herbal twinge and even a grassy quality. Lacks perfect poise but it can't be called timid or dull.",Spain,Albariño
"A simple but nice style of Ribera wine with open plum and berry aromas as well as snappy, juicy, fresh red fruit flavors. It's a touch biting and zesty at this point, but if you don't mind a little bite and zap it's perfectly good.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Here's another good value red from Borsao. It's about as potent and packed a wine as you'll find for $7, and while it's jumpy, young and aggressive, it's also full of jammy black fruit, sticky extraction and firm tannins. A classic mouthfiller with spunk, color and heft.",Spain,Garnacha
"Smells more meaty and leathery than you might expect for a basic, young Tempranillo. But enough berry fruit sneaks through to make it a solid but narrow wine driven by red plum and other standard red-fruit flavors. Finishes fresh but lean.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A medicinal cherry aroma is solid despite its suggestion of plastic or latex. The mouthfeel is lively and edgy, offering raw tannins. Flavors of strawberry, plum and spice end in swirls of vanilla and cream. For a fresh, traditional Rioja, this is pretty good.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is initially dark and earthy, with brandied cherry, leather and tobacco aromas. It feels complete and offers core acids to keep it feeling fresh. Flavors of black fruit and spice lead to a lasting finish with cola and cherry notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bold berry aromas charge forth in a clean, pointed fashion. This feels firm and solid, with no obvious flaws and a dark flavor of blackberry that's offset by notes of rooty licorice and sweet brown sugar. Lengthy and fresh on the finish.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Rooty and earthy smelling, this has aromas of leather, cassis, tobacco, dried cheese and cola. It feels rich and nicely textured, with firm but friendly tannins that set up tobacco, coffee, mocha and roasted berry flavors. It's chocolaty in an uncanny way on the finish. Drink now through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite ripe on the nose, such that raisin and sweetness are front and center. Saturated in the mouth, but as a whole it's a bit flabby and, for the most part, it's neither here nor there. Flavors of plum and berry tilt to the dark side, while the finish is short but inoffensive.",Spain,Tempranillo
"After an initial blast of earth and lettuce, this Cabernet finds some of its fruity essence. But still, it has persistent green notes that interfere with the wine's candied black fruit component. Finishes tannic and slightly clampy, with decent length and a mix of cassis, cherry and herbs. Classic Old World Cabernet from the Penedès.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark and a touch murky, with earthy aromas of black cherry, leather and forest floor. The palate is well sized and feels healthy, while the flavors of plum and blackberry are slightly herbal. Shows pop, length and some bitterness on the finish. A regular wine for regular occasions.",Spain,Tempranillo
"L. A mostly clean wine that hints at earth and leather but settles on basic red fruit. The palate shows mild, manageable snap and sharpness, while the palate deals flavors of red fruits, rubber and leather. Lean and clean, but basic as they come.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Not a lot of pop or life to the nose. What there is, however, is mostly light, herbal and pickled. Flavorwise, this shy wine settles on dry cherry and herbs, while the finish is rooty and leafy. Elegant in some ways, but our bet is that it's a little too weak and green for most palates.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pungent and grassy on the nose, with a strong nettle and green herb character. The palate is soft and playful, with pithy white fruit flavors and then a soda-like dry finish. Plump, wayward and a bit green overall.",Spain,Sauvignon
"Tan-gold in color, with a mustardy, somewhat rustic bouquet that's salinic and short on snappy fruit. The palate is chunky, with melon and apple for flavors. Seems low on pulse; the bet here is this was better six months ago and is now in decline.",Spain,Albariño
"Smells peppery and dark, yet the body is crisp and zingy due to sharp acidity. Flavors of raspberry and cherry skins run fast, while the finish is acid-washed and quick, with a lasting bit of herbal flavor and tartness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mildly earthy, leathery and light in color, with rooty aromas and tree bark on the nose. The palate is good, maybe a bit sharp and angular, with savory flavors of tomato, red plum and earth. Dry on the finish and good for everyday consumption.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fresh-cut oak is front and center on this now-aging blend of Monastrell and Merlot. There's a green, almost cheesy accent to the nose, which is followed by generic plum flavor. Always resiny and creamy due to the oak, with some prune to the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mildly raw and reduced, but at $6 expectations shouldn't be too high. In the mouth, it's tangy and light, with zingy strawberry/raspberry flavors that have some scour. Bland but lively.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raw and rough more than flush or lush. The nose deals mildly pickled red-fruit aromas in front of a tight, acidic palate that tastes of pie cherries. Firm and zesty but not much length or substance. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fizzy and foamy and aggressive. To give it a frame of reference, it is similar to Brachetto or Frascati from Italy, but it's clumsy on the palate and tastes too much like red licorice and candied fruit to be taken too seriously. Also a bit cloying on the finish. Imported by National Distributing Co., Inc.",Spain,Rosé
"Berry, plum and pastry aromas carry a bit of stalky sweetness. It feels juicy, textured and mildly tannic, with lightly herbal berry and resin flavors. Oaky on the finish, it has a good set of outgoing flavors and length.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dense and concentrated on the nose, this features blackberry and black cherry aromas, with hardly any perceptible oak. It feels fresh but choppy and tannic, with roasted plum, berry and savory spice flavors. It's baked in flavor and gritty in feel as it finishes.",Spain,Garnacha
"Earth, cola, berry, toast and leather aromas share the bouquet. The palate is narrow and pinched by firm tannins, while the flavor profile deals a mix of herb, toast and plum. Warm, earthy and oaky on the finish, the wine carries a lemony accent and satisfying length.",Spain,Red Blend
"Apart from its note of fresh apple and hint of juniper, the nose is fairly neutral. It feels clean, crisp and cleansing, with pear and nectarine flavors that finish light, with medium intensity and length. Drink right away for maximum freshness and expression.",Spain,Albariño
"Covers all the principle bases via aromas of ripe dark fruit, bacon, spice and herbs. The palate is a bit soft but it's serious, with raspberry, cherry and plum flavors. Tastes slightly roasted on the finish, with spice and solid tannins. Ranks as a very good all-occasion red. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Here's a bright, forward, no-issues Garnacha that shows the upside of Calatayud and the grape in general. It's a touch raw and racy, but otherwise it's a nice wine with forward cherry flavors and a lightly charred, earthy finish. Pointed and racy, which is what you want from Spanish Garnacha.",Spain,Garnacha
"Big on the nose, with regionally typical aromas of mineral, black fruit and herbs. The palate is a touch rough and hot, but it houses forward black plum, raisin and chocolate cake flavors. Fleshy and pretty big, but sort of wayward on the finish. Shows good structure and power. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Expressive white wine from the high plains of central Spain. Pie Franco is one of the more forward, high-quality wines from Rueda. It's 100% Verdejo and thus it sizzles with green apple, melon, citrus and celery aromas and flavors. Almost like dry 7Up in the mouth, with spritz, zest and persistence. Drink now. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Verdejo
"This smells like orange marmalade. It feels smooth and creamy, but not terribly thick due to fine acidity, with flavors of orange, honey, peach and spice. Long and creamy on the finish, this is a fresh, delicious wine that should impress anyone with a sweet tooth.",Spain,Moscatel
"This has a pretty light color, with dry raspberry and citrus scents. The palate is pure and elegant, with tangerine, grapefruit and nectarine flavors. This finishes longer than most, with poise and grace.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is a serious Toro wine with smooth, dark, leathery aromas along with hints of wintergreen, licorice and berry pastry. It feels rich and layered, with complex flavors of licorice gum drop, nutmeg, chocolate and blackberry. Almost decadent but not over the top or too tannic. Drink now–2016.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Fresh, floral and not overbearing on the nose, this has red berry and cassis aromas, with no interference from oak or too much extraction. It feels pure and elegant, with wild berry and cherry flavors that end on a ripe, slightly sweet-tasting finish. Good for near-term drinking.",Spain,Red Blend
"Violet as all get-out, with a nose that initially smells like bug juice. This is all about sweet, youthful fruit, so if you're looking for sophistication at bargain- basement prices you're shopping in the wrong place. What you will get is blackberry fruit, sweetness and gummy tannins. In the grand scheme of things it's just o.k., but for $6 you should not expect more.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of black fruits and licorice start things in a good direction, but over time it turns more pruney and raisiny. for a dark, extracted wine the palate is clangy and jumpy, with cherry and herbal plum flavors. Firm and medium-long on the finish, with a lasting herbal essence.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Despite showing forced sweetness, this Catalonian blend always delivers in its price category. There's dusty lemon-lime and powdered sugar aromas and flavors along with papaya and green melon. It's never going to be a sophisticated white but it does get the job done for $5.99. And because of that there will always be a market for René Barbier Mediterranean White.",Spain,White Blend
"Fairly green on the nose, with a bit of brandied black fruit and kirsch. The palate is on the thin side but not grating, while the flavors center around snappy cherry, raspberry and tomato. Turns toward vegetal on the midpalate while not entirely going Martian green, yet it's more dilute and wan than we'd like to see, even for a 2002.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Carbonic maceration gives this Rioja a candied, somewhat odd set of aromas and flavors. It is mildly cheesy and sweet on the nose, with powdered cinnamon poking through. In the mouth, it shows even more candied cherry and raspberry, but also red licorice. Nothing overly bad about it, but still it tastes and smells a bit artificial.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Clear as crystal up front, and then come flavors of lemon and green apple. There is almost no overt sweetness to it; it's quite acidic and sharp, which is common for the Hondarrabi Zuri grape from Northern Spain. As might be expected, green apple and lime control the austere finish. Good but very narrow in scope.",Spain,Hondarrabi Zuri
"Mildly sugary on the nose, with creamy flavors of papaya mixed with grass. The acidity is spiky and the finish sort of scouring. Not a lot of depth, body or pizzazz, and it seems as though maybe some oak was thrown at it.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"For a higher-priced wine, this has some issues. The nose is heavy and murky, with leathery, baked aromas. In the mouth, it's somewhat choppy and acidic, thus punctuating the cherry tomato portion of the earth-and-leather flavor profile. Lingering oak accents the finish, which is zesty and leans toward sour.",Spain,Garnacha
"Rusty in hue, with mature, slightly old aromas of leather, gym bag, dried leaves and mature berry. The palate has depth and concentration, while the flavors are herbal and run toward baked black cherry and tobacco. Caramel and mature fruit flavors vie for control of the roasted finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"A clean, nice, regular Tempranillo with normal black cherry and berry aromas that offer hints of rubber and bacon. The palate is tannic and grabby but balanced for the most part, with pure, basic blackberry and cherry flavors. Modest in its scope, but fresh and untainted.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Garnacha-Cabernet Sauvignon is the blend and it's showing some age. The nose is a little heavy and murky, and so is the palate. Flavors of melon and papaya are more plump than zesty and driven. Falls rather flat on the finish. Wait for the 2008.",Spain,Rosé
"All over the map. The nose offers toast offset by gym sweat, while the palate is both tangy yet pickled, with zingy orange flavors. The wine flows across the tongue but leaves a bit of citrus rind and vinegar. Not bad per se, but has some weak links. Imported by Winelink Imports.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Big in color, with meaty, rubbery aromas that seem reduced and gaseous. The palate is black and toasty, but sort of rubbery. Burnt toast, black coffee and some bitterness control the finish. More colorful and big than flavorful and complete.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A bit too rubbery and gassy to qualify as “clean,” with leafiness running the bouquet. The palate is sort of flat, with raisin, baked cherry and prune flavors. It's on the borderline of being stewed.",Spain,Red Blend
"Not super fruity. Instead it's a generic, racy specimen with lots of zap, kick and zest but not much style, warmth or fruit. Shows fiery flavors and a tight, driving finish. Expect many 2007s, including this one, to be on the miserly side.",Spain,Tempranillo
"As a young wine, this is bold, dark, crusty and slightly out of joint. There are salty, balsamic flavors along with muscular berry notes, and then butter and other barrel-driven flavors on the finish. It's chunky bordering on huge, with balance and integration issues. Maybe a little better in six months.",Spain,Red Blend
"Gummy, pasty and sweet, with no real elegance or finesse. It's simply a dark, candied wine that's pure tutti-frutti. And the feel is more narrow than one might hope for given the wine's immense color and body.",Spain,Grenache
"Toasty and rubbery aromas lead to a drastic, rather sharp palate of brazen red cherry and plum. More tang and pickled than rich and rewarding, with a fiery mouthfeel and scouring acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With dusty apple and mineral aromas, this feels healthy and plump, with apple, pear and lime flavors that sit in front of a citric and mildly green finish. Good and normal as Rueda wines go.",Spain,Verdejo
"Cedar cigar box and berry aromas become significantly more charred and toasted upon airing. It feels good, with plum, berry and plenty of burnt toast in the flavor package. It finishes dark and spicy, with a leftover burnt note.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is mellow upfront, but it also has solid plum and berry aromas. On the palate it's grabby but good, with tough tannins that support dark plum and savory notes. Chewy and chocolaty on the finish, it has a mossy accent and firm leftover tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Varietally correct on the nose, this has green apple, grapefruit and floral aromas. It feels basic, tangy and linear, with notes of melon, citrus and a dry, crisp finish that's mildly briny and a touch bitter.",Spain,Verdejo
"Likable from the start, with black fruit, baking spice and exotic sandalwood notes, this is firm and drying in feel, with a blend of dark berry, toast and peppery spice flavors. It remains dry on the finish, with a pinch of heat that food should tame.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Montecillo's first effort with Albariño is perfectly crisp and pleasant. The nose offers pure citrus and tropical fruit, the feel is even and balanced, and the flavors are dry and veer toward apple and green melon. Long on the finish and nicely integrated; one of the best under-$15 Albariños going. Imported by Underdog Wine Merchants.",Spain,Albariño
"A noticeable step down from the 2005 Volver. This vintage is gangly and quasi out of control. At 14.5% alcohol, it's very big. And the aromas of shoe polish, burnt rubber, cola and vinegar are almost volatile and aggressive. Finishes edgy, sort of tannic and oily. Seems like the producer went straight for power and size while forgetting about balance.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Generally speaking, this a neutral wine that makes no impression. It shows pine and generic citrus on the nose, followed by equally generic apple and orange flavors. Waxy and drying on the finish, with limited scope and depth. Drink right away, if at all.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"As a fan of almost everything O. Fournier puts in the bottle, I'd say this value-oriented wine needs work. For starters, it mixes Zinfandel-like blueberry fruit with green, weedy aromas. The palate holds onto that green essence while also tossing out rhubarb, tea and carob flavors. Lacks the ripeness and structure as it should have, even at this modest price.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rubbery but fresh smelling, with sharp acidity that creates big-time juiciness but also an angular feel. Tastes of zippy, tangy red fruits that are crisp and sizzle away. Gets a bit more deep and earthy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite strange and funky smelling, with uncommon grass, floral, hickory and blueberry aromas. The palate feels fine but has a sweet, faux-weedy core flavor that's offset by candied berry flavors. Tastes of licorice and lactic creaminess on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Funky and smelling of pine and tarragon. That aromatic sharpness carries straight to the palate, where the feel is narrow and the flavors are short and tangy, with little to no big-time berry fruit. Simply an acceptable underperformer that's tough and sharp.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of pine, rubber and rhubarb are austere, and so is the rest of the wine. The palate is run by acidity, which is sharp and scouring. Flavors are tart and underdone, with pie cherry and red raspberry. Sheering but admittedly cleansing, with surprising sourness.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dusty and with nice apple and spice aromas. The palate, however, is quite flat and devoid of a lively bubble bead. Flavors of pear and melon run sweet, while the finish is dull and lacks effervescence.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Quite an oaky wine, with aromas of BBQ, hickory, roasted plum and spice. The body is full but scratchy, with additional oak manifesting itself in the form of baked, rooty, vanilla flavors that override the wine's simple but quiet fruit content. Finishes dark and toasty, with coffee, mocha and vanilla flavors.",Spain,Red Blend
"For an '04 reserva, this wine is more edgy, grabby and high in acid than expected. The nose shows old world leather, spearmint and smoked meat more than vibrant fruit, yet the palate is tangy, citric and tastes of red raspberry and plum. Slightly more creamy on the finish, but still it remains scratchy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A different breed of cat. The nose is akin to nail polish and sweet perfume, while the palate is super simple and doesn't rise much above liquid candy. Not awful but not challenging or refined. Has a lasting simple jamminess that isn't elevating.",Spain,Garnacha
"Violet in color but sassy. The nose is pickled and brambly, while the palate offers crusty berry fruit and herbal, marinated flavors. Edgy and sharp as feel goes, with an angular, acid-driven finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Tobacco, spice and cranberry aromas mix with nutty leather and sweat. This is a tangy, choppy wine with more tomato and citrus flavor than ripe berry fruit. So even for fans of classic Rioja this will seem light, lean and leathery.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A little jammy up front, but mostly this is dull and bland, with generic citrus-inspired flavors and some bitterness late. Can't see this really helping out food or standing alone as an apéritif.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mami Mia, this is heavy stuff. The nose on this Garnacha-Graciano mix is muddled and rubbery, while the palate is saturated but murky. Finishes almost salty, with a hint of the veggies. A loud wine that doesn't really say anything.",Spain,Garnacha-Graciano
"No Time is the name but unfortunately there's no substance and no richness. As a whole, this Garnacha smells of bramble and pickle, while the palate is fresh and bouncy but sour.",Spain,Garnacha
"Despite basic strawberry and red licorice aromas, this wine is decidedly tart. It hits with snappy nectarine flavors and then turns citric and finishes up sour. Doesn't offer much rosé pleasure; makes you wonder what's the point.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flat and loamy on the nose, and then slightly floral. There is not much going on here; the palate offers distant strawberry flavors accented by pickle, and the finish is thin, tangy and hints at tomato. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This wine doesn't do much for Navarra's reputation as prime Spanish rosé country. It's a little burnt and acrid, with weak and muddled raspberry and pickle flavors. Finishes dry as a soda cracker.",Spain,Rosé
"This is heavy and raisiny, with ripe earth and mineral aromas that are suggestive of Port. It feels loaded and scratchy, with licorice, prune and pepper flavors that finish short and with some heat. A bullish style to drink now.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Bits of grass and green tobacco infiltrate the otherwise sturdy and solid nose on this Tempranillo-based blend that includes Merlot, Cabernet and Syrah. It feels medium bodied and fresh, with red plum, raspberry, herb and coffee flavors. The finish turns leafy, chocolaty and herbal.",Spain,Red Blend
"Satinela has been on the upswing in recent years as it has become more complex. This vintage smells of lime, mineral and dusty apple. It feels fresh and right for the style, with Bartlett pear, lime and dry spice flavors.",Spain,White Blend
"Dense and dark, this has earthy, crusty berry aromas and a sprinkle of herb on the nose. It hits with aggression but settles down nicely to offer raspberry, plum and savory herb flavors. Lively acidity allows for a long finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Citrusy aromas suggest orange juice and grapefruit pith. This feels balanced, with apple, papaya, melon and banana flavors that feed into a sweet-tasting finish that's slightly mealy in feel and flavor. Good and tasty, but drink immediately.",Spain,Verdejo
"With mineral, apple and peach aromas, this gets off on the right footing. The palate is zesty and acidic, with a tangy set of apple, citrus and mineral flavors. Controlled heft, weight and spritz on the finish make it a solid bet. Look for the weird blue bottle and take it from there. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Spain,Albariño
"Good and lusty, with dark aromas of kirsch, chocolate, shoe polish, burnt oak and perfume. And while it may lack some focus, the palate is flush with ripe black fruit touched up by wood spice, pepper and herbs. Finishes generous and solid, with olive and savory herb notes. Drink now; 16,800 cases made. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark, compact and black, with graphite and growling blackberry aromas. Feels tight and drawing but serious and structured, with black fruit, chocolate, toast and spice flavors. Blackened as well on the finish, with mint and toast. Hold until 2015.",Spain,Mencía
"Fairly flat on the nose, and also innocuous on the palate. Flavors of green melon and nectarine are modest at best, and while the mouthfeel is decent, the overall character of the wine isn't that exciting. Finishes pithy, citric and mealy. Yet another mediocre Navarran Chardonnay.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Clean plum and berry is the opening act, but after initial black-fruit and spice aromas there is only an underdeveloped set of flavors that run sassy, sour and stretched. The feel is decidedly tart, while the finish is more acidic and less friendly than most varietal Monastrells. 400 cases made.",Spain,Monastrell
"Color and mouthfeel are the highlights of this exceedingly green wine. Try as we might to figure out why, this is one of the more vegetal wines we've tried from Rioja. It's green-bean city on the nose, and the flavor profile is dominated by tomato, herbs and bell pepper. Think 1990s Chilean Merlot, early Super Tuscans or New Zealand Cabernet and you will know what we mean by “green.”",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ku Dé Ta is one of these new “global” brands with wines from Argentina, Spain, Chile, etc. This Tempranillo is decidedly stemmy and burnt. The nose shows acrid accents and green notes, which are followed by generic fruit, green herb and carob flavors. Not the type of wine that will improve. 8,000 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cambra's wines all seem sheer and tannic. This blend of Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc is funky at first, with clamshell, cheese and sweat aromas. In the mouth, it is all over the map, with short black-cherry flavors, lasting tartness and overt tannins. More shallow and hard than deep, rewarding and balanced.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc
"Red fruit, sucking candy and milk chocolate cover the bouquet, but the palate is sharp and raw, with spiky, semisour raspberry and cherry flavors. There isn't much to this wine. It's sharp, edgy, elastic and lean. On the plus side, it's clean.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Waxy, peachy aromas are less than fresh, and the palate follows that lead via soft, pithy flavors of orange and melon. Shows little grip or structure for Godello and the finish fails to bring it home with kick or pop. Already past its prime. Tasted twice.",Spain,Godello
"Smells earthy, murky and a little raisiny, and then in the mouth it scratches with grating tannins in support of floral cherry and tart red fruit flavors. Finishes sort of hollow and sour; standard issue at best.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean, fruity and snappy, with pointed red fruit aromas and flavors as well as higher than normal acidity. Tastes fresh and forward and entirely straightforward, with a hollow but easy finish and mild but controlled sharpness.",Spain,Grenache
"Almost red in color, with dusty aromas that mix in a blast of latex and dried cherry notes. The wine is made from organically grown Bobal grapes, and it offers tang and bite along with crisp flavors of plum skins, raspberry and citrus. Almost sour, but not. A solid quaffer for the price.",Spain,Rosé
"A standard Riojano red with crisp cherry aromas followed by a zesty, slightly tart palate that carries punchy cherry fruit, acidity and little nuance or character. Tastes a tiny bit sour by today's measurements, but it's still pretty good for being crisp and acid-driven.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Slightly vinegary on the cherry-laden nose, with a mild but persistent briney character. The palate is high in acid, leading to some scour, but the flavors of plum and berry, while generic, are pretty good. Finishes with hints of toast, pepper and spice. Solid enough for $8.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A dud given that this is the winery's top effort. It's green and vegetal, with ashtray aromas. More like salad than wine. Not too many wines these days are blatantly bell peppery, but this is.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is as basic as Albariño gets, with aromas of sweet apple and pear. It feels round and a bit soft, with fleshy peach and dry melon flavors. The finish is pithy, with a white pepper note and an indication that the wine is starting to fade. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"Leather and berry aromas are welcoming and veer toward mint. It feels solid and textured, with lightly oaked, earthy flavors of meaty berry and vanilla. It tastes roasted and shows medium intensity on the finish. A good crianza from a marginal vintage.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Yellow in color, with buttercup, wild flower and leesy white-fruit aromas, this feels spritzy, with melon, papaya and white peach flavors. It's mildly minerally and dry in flavor on the finish. Drink as soon as possible.",Spain,Albariño
"What a monster this is. Aromas of roasted meat, compost, leather, berry and plum give it a rugged bouquet, while the superripe palate is big as sin and loaded with ultrasweet blackberry, soy and peppery flavors. Succulent, chocolaty and dark, it's like an earthquake in your mouth. Expensive for what you get, and recommended solely for fans of huge, modern wines. Imported by Kobrand.",Spain,Petite Verdot
"This is a nice Rueda wine that is on the cusp of excellence. With citrus, pine and tropical fruit aromas, it is fleshy and shows good body and feel. Flavors of peach and pineapple are full, while the finish is rich and almost creamy in texture. Drink immediately. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Verdejo
"More familiar and less unusual than prior vintages. This wine deals typical, upright lemon, lime and tropical fruit aromas backed by green apple and lemon-based flavors. With good acidity and an even keel, it is a solid, fresh, dry Albariño that should not disappoint. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Albariño
"This is Scottish winemaker Norrel Robertson's unoaked, straightforward Garnacha. It has mildly stemmy, all-natural aromas followed by zesty red-fruit flavors, herbal accents and a quick, acid-washed palate and finish. There's ample body and power, and fresh, candied red-fruit character.",Spain,Garnacha
"Big and lush, this has graphite, coconut, minty oak and huge berry fruit aromas. It's plush in the mouth but not wayward or overly big, with roasted plum, ­molasses, leather and raspberry flavors and a forward barrel note. Savory and long on the finish, this is a blend of 40% Monastrell, 30% Tempranillo and 15% each Syrah and Cabernet.",Spain,Red Blend
"Composed and not the least bit pushy or punishing on the bouquet, this has gorgeous berry and spice aromas. It feels a bit racy and high in acidity, but that will only serve the wine well in the long run. Plum and boysenberry flavors lead to a racy, high-acid finish. Drink now–2020.",Spain,Monastrell
"This is dark and tarry at first, with aromas of freshly laid asphalt, pepper, fine herbs, burnt toast and roasted berry. This feels racy, healthy and balanced, with a creamy quality to the palate. It tastes natural and correct, with plum, berry, vanilla and spice flavors. On the finish, it's smooth with a strong oak-based vanilla flavor. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Black fruit, heavy oak, tobacco and mineral aromas are welcoming on this ripped Priorat.It's full bodied, holding onto its schisty character via berry fruit and mineral flavors. Additional oak, vanilla and mint flavors rise up on the finish, but there's plenty of plum and cherry notes below the surface. 500 cases made.",Spain,Red Blend
"Quite green and also raisiny, which doesn't really compute seeing that one indicates underripeness and the other overripeness. But throw both together and you get a wine that's not all that pleasing and seems to be striving for equilibrium. Gummy, green and thick-tasting in the mouth. A hard wine to get excited about.",Spain,Red Blend
"Wax and peach-pit aromas give it a decent opening act, but the palate is dull and totally without a future. Flavors of orange and grapefruit are mealy and drying, while the finish is almost bitter. Though it's Sauvignon Blanc, it tastes like a mediocre cava with no bubbles.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"A little strange and unusual on the nose, with a mix of grass, citrus and corn-like aromas. The palate is wayward and slightly citrusy, with a hint of grapefruit and also some vegetal flavors. Pretty good mouthfeel and acidity keep it afloat, but overall it's not going to win over too many fans.",Spain,White Blend
"This is the first varietal Xarello we've seen from Sumarroca and doesn't have us begging for more. The nose is neutral except for some petrol, while the palate is citric and tastes like you might expect: like orange juice. Tart and puckery on the finish. A novelty not worth your time.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"Hot and poorly structured, with o.k. cherry cola aromas but very little on the palate. Tastes tart and of sour plums, with a short, starchy, tannic finish. Raw stuff that's not that good in the scheme of things.",Spain,Red Blend
"So this is what Chardonnay, Macabeo and Sauvignon Blanc amount to when thrown together. The Three, or “Las Tres” if you prefer, is grabby and mealy, with thick, unfocused citrus flavors and then apple skins and bitterness on the finish. Too strange to rate higher. Already fading.",Spain,White Blend
"Oily and frankly a bit skunky on the nose. The palate is spritzed yet soft, with chunky, blowsy, generic white fruit flavors. Doesn't inspire; this winery's red wines are better.",Spain,Picapoll
"Burnt rubber and a certain stemmy, roasted character is draped over the nose and palate. It has a decent, normal feel to it but the flavors of strawberry and raspberry are herbal and burnt. Tastes and smells rubbery and not fully clean.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mild lime and mineral aromas draw interest, but the wine's palate is medium spritzy and sour, with sharp, lemony flavors and a dilute feel. Seems caught between the flat and lightly carbonated style of Txakoli and ends up in no man's land.",Spain,Hondarrabi Zuri
"Tan like cream soda, with a weird, faded bouquet of banana pudding and resiny oak. Soft and weakly structured except for lasting acidity, while it tastes like fermented apples and finishes on bitter walnut. A strange bird made from Sauvignon Blanc and white Tempranillo.",Spain,White Blend
"Sweet and fiery on the nose, with piercing aromas that burn right up your nasal passages. The palate is pinched and super tannic, with biting flavors of black licorice, blackberry and cola. Could be better with a softer, smoother mouthfeel but seeing that this is an '04 with six years behind it, it isn't going to soften up much.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells a little too much like berry candy and cough syrup to win you over, and the palate is kind of flat and chunky as well as thick with creamy berry fruit. Points of acidic bite give it life, but things are brought back down on the finish with green, creamy oak notes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Quite candied and jumpy on the nose, what some might call bug juice. Having spent six months in American oak, it's tight and tough on the palate, with fresh, juicy acidity that's a bit scouring. Tastes much like milk chocolate and candied fruit.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Begins with pasty, lactic aromas and heavy fruit. The palate is both big and clumsy, with sharp acidity amid bulk leading to choppy plum and medicinal cherry flavors. A clacky wine with power but not much finesse.",Spain,Garnacha
"Jammy, dark and reduced, with breadth along with leather and compost aromas. The palate is leathery, funky and medicinal, with viscosity and creamy berry flavors. Has richness and body but the flavors and congruety are sketchy until you remember that it costs but $7.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Neon pink in color, with heavier aromas that split time between chemical and candied. The palate is a bit awkward and heavy, with jumbled flavors of pomegranate juice, cherry and strawberry. Loses focus as it moves along, and finishes with a slightly bitter aftertaste.",Spain,Rosé
"Simple at best early on, with leathery, rustic aromas and a truly basic set of flavors. Should you allow it to breathe, it rounds into a good (but still basic), semisoft and fruity red with solid cherry/berry flavors and nothing offputting.",Spain,Red Blend
"This smells stalky and leafy, with a baked element. It shows tomato-driven acidity and red-leaning flavors of cranberry, tomato and raspberry that are touched up by notes of oak-based vanilla and dill. Tomato and tobacco flavors are key to the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This opens with a bouquet that's packed with bold berry fruit aromas, plus a mineral accent. It feels zesty, solid and slightly clampy, with plum and cherry flavors that lead to a tight, juicy finish, with modest length and power",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Brambly, leathery and roasted on the nose, this features raspberry and plum aromas in the backdrop. It feels fresh, clampy and forward, with a mix of leather, herb, plum, tomato and spice flavors. A solid wine with traditional Rioja character.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet and ripe smelling, with licorice and black cherry on the nose. The mouthfeel has a slight astringency to it, but the overall emphasis seems to be on red fruit so that narrowness works. Fresh, quenching and seemingly made to go with foods such as chorizo or fatty Spanish ham. 900 cases made. Imported by Vino Cava.",Spain,Red Blend
"With its light leafy aromas and spice notes, this wine takes you back to another era in Rioja. It offers traditional flavors of tomato, nectarine peel and raspberry on a dry, juicy palate. Nothing special but perfectly good for fans of classic everyday Rioja wines. Imported by Admiral Imports. Best Buy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is deep and fruity up front, with blackberry and cola aromas that come with creamy oak and offsetting minerality. Full and jammy on the palate, with flavors of blackberry, fine herbs and lightly applied molasses. Round and concentrated on the finish. Drink now through 2016.",Spain,Red Blend
"One of Spain's most character-packed wines, this vintage of Mas La Plana deals bacon, berry and earthy aromas in front of a weighty, fairly tannic palate. Becoming richer and riper as it unfolds, this is full of prune, plum and earthy stewed-berry flavors. It gets better and shows more complexity with air. Drink now–2018.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Significantly better in 2005. This vintage is vegetal and mildly vinegary, with pickled aromas. The palate shows decent body, but the flavors are all bramble, pickle and sharp berry. Finishes stemmy and sharp.",Spain,Monastrell
"Smells like canned fruit, and tastes like greens along with mealy pineapple. Falls apart on the finish. Not recommended but not lethal. Barely acceptable.",Spain,White Blend
"Two years in a row this has been a subpar wine. Mealy nectarine aromas are barely adequate, while the palate is sour and finishes bitter. Not a foul experience, but unexciting and not really worth a look.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Neon purple in color, young and jumpy, but hey, that's what simple Garnacha from this part of Spain is all about. Expect fruity, jammy aromas and a blazing, full-fruited palate of rubber, black fruits and bacon. It's grapey but honest, and for the price it's as expected.",Spain,Garnacha
"Aromas of chocolate mint, creamy vanilla and candy reflect a heavy-handed oak treatment, and a sweet burnt cherry and chocolate mint character is present throughout. Creamy on the tongue, but confected in terms of flavors and finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Somewhat stewy and leathery for starters, with a thick, creamy palate that shows stemmy, roasted plum and berry flavors. The feel is solid and thick, but the flavors don't really come around and settle.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fairly light and leathery, with strained aromas of animal hide and burnt berry fruit. The palate feel is light to medium, with scratchiness, and the flavors are of roasted fruit, leather and dryness. Spice and a slight bitterness define the finish. Has a few issues but still a good wine for $10.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Palacio Quemado, which means the Burnt Palace, is a funky wine from Extremadura that mixes forceful floral aromas with barnyard and grape juice scents. It's a fuller-bodied, grabby wine with chunky, medicinal flavors and a finish that meanders before settling on big and herbal. Has its good points and weaknesses.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is definitely a briny specimen, but under the pickled blanket there's depth of fruit, texture and complexity. It feels tight and lively, with salinic flavors of citrus fruit and apple. The finish holds onto that briny character, but the feel, balance and overall quality are solid.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This ripe-leaning wine has raisin and licorice aromas, with firm leather and saddle notes. It feels full and tannic, then tastes a bit woody and resiny, with berry and cassis flavors. The wine finds a needed dose of freshness on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This opens with strong scents of rubber, burnt leaf and funky berry that stay with the wine all the way until the finish. It feels wiry, tight and jumpy, with raspberry, plum and leather flavors, plus a rubbery note on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is dark, roasted and rubbery on the nose, with staunch aromas of dark chocolate, char and tire. It feels full, layered and tannic, with deep plum, berry and chocolate flavors, leading to a chewy finish full of vanilla and fudge.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A tight-grained oak aroma mixes with notes of red berry, herb, leather and aged cheese. It feels rubbery but solid, with roasted flavors of berry and sweet plum. A bit warm and rubbery on the finish. This is a blend of equal parts Carignan and Garnacha.",Spain,Red Blend
"A little old school with its dill and vanilla aromas and flavors, but with leather, raisin and berry accents and a nice medium-deep body, it more than gets the job done. The palate features herbal plum and berry flavors, while the finish is a bit short on fruit and long on dill. Improves with airing; drink now. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Nice and friendly but also a little flatter than in years past. Aromas of lemon blossom, peach and other white fruits are standard, while the palate is less than edgy, with creamy apple, melon and spun sugar flavors. Sweet and solid, but on the softer side. Drink right away. Imported by Republic National Distributing Co..",Spain,Albariño
"The Crespiello grape isn't one you see often, but it yields a deep, dark style of wine with balsamic notes, fresh black-fruit flavors and weight. This one is almost on the side of cooked, but not quite, thus it blazes a path with blackberry, smoked meat, jerky spice and more. A touch flat but not flabby.",Spain,Crespiello
"This single-vineyard beauty continues its run of excellence. The '07 is dense, toasty and powerful, with bacon, vanilla, cigar box and wild berry aromas that set up a strong-boned, fully structured palate overflowing with dark cherry, boysenberry, tobacco and sweet vanilla flavors. Needs time; drink from 2012 through 2022.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aurus defines awesome modern Rioja. The nose is floral and decked out with wild berry aromas, marzipan, vanilla and hard spices. The palate is powerful and tannic, with bold cassis, raspberry, cherry, coffee and chocolate flavors. Beautifully crafted and with a nice red fruit element courtesy of 15% Graciano to go with old vines Tempranillo. Drink from 2012–2021.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts with tough, almost harsh green aromas on the nose, but with time it settles on herbs and tobacco. The palate is fresh but a touch spiky and grabby, with herbal plum and berry flavors. Solid mouthfeel and length make it worthwhile even if it's herbal and slightly green tasting.",Spain,Garnacha
"Opens with vinaigrette and balsamic notes along with leather and black fruit aromas. The palate is soft and muddled, with soupy, stewy flavors and a jagged, candied finish. Seems to struggle for balance, which is a common flaw in many Toro wines.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Sweet, plummy and unrefined on both the nose and palate. This is nothing more than simple juice that isn't terrible. It's grapey, sweet and tart, with an edgy bit of tang to the finish. Regular at best; subpar if you're being critical.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy aromas mix with grassy green notes in front of a sweet, chunky palate that offers unconvincing, generic berry flavors. Devoid of elegance and character but loaded with heft and baked fruit. A sweet, rudimentary wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Balsamic and hard, with a briney, stemmy set of chemical-tinged black fruit aromas. The palate hits with force and noise; it's hard, tannic and unforgiving. The flavors of baked berry are rich, but the finish is grating and blazes with tannic burn.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Pear and apple aromas provide a good opening to this flowery, slightly sweet-tasting wine. It maintains freshness and pop that doesn't last long in the glass. Flavors of lime and melon end with a hint of papaya. Seems as if it's beginning to fade.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"For fresh, basic Cava with a juicy profile and clarity, you can't go wrong with this. Apple and lime aromas are straightforward and clean, while the palate is tight and tastes of spiced apple, lime and orange. It's crisp, focused and easy to enjoy.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"From an off vintage, this hits with piercing cherry and black olive aromas. It's powerful, almost astringent, with grating tannins that intensify as the wine unwinds. Brandied cherry, coffee and chocolate flavors set up a rowdy finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rubbery dark-berry aromas yield to earth, leather and chocolate scents upon airing. This feels healthy and standard, with full-force flavors of medicinal berry. It's tight, fresh and slightly resiny on the finish, despite having spent only three months in oak. A blend of 80% Garnacha and 20% Carignan.",Spain,Grenache-Carignan
"Red plum and cherry aromas accompany a hint of lemony oak. The palate feels fresh, suggesting tomato, with ample body. It tastes of red fruit, accented by nutmeg and candied berry, and it feels tough on the finish, with flavors of vanilla and plastic. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Tempranillo in descending order.",Spain,Red Blend
"Good wine from a very hot year. Early aromas of Band-Aid and barnyard fade with airing, and then forest floor and black fruit step in. The palate is expressive and tasty, with solid blackberry, tea and herbal flavors. Finishes dry, with mocha and chocolate. Drink now. Imported by Vino Cava.",Spain,Red Blend
"Apparently the allure of Rioja proved too great for the Torres family, because now they have a wine from Spain's signature region. Ibéricos is dark and fruity, with exotic perfume notes and also some soupy qualities. The flavors of strawberry and raspberry have a thick creamy accent, while vanilla and dill are prominent on the finish. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Substantive, with complexities on the bouquet, this has a lemon-lime aroma that is dry, chiseled and friendly. It feels tangy, citrusy and crisp, with tangerine and lemon as the key flavors. This is fresh and focused from start to finish. The addition of 15% Chardonnay brings it up a notch.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is a great wine, from a vintage that wasn't great. The nose is smooth and rich, with raspberry, plum, fine oak and all the spice that comes with it. The palate feels fresh and healthy, with racy blackberry fruit tempered by creamy chocolate, vanilla and spice. Like most high-end wines from the Eguren family, this is right on the money. Drink now through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Strawberry and raspberry aromas come on with aggression, and the bouquet doesn't really evolve. The palate is crisp, snappy and high in acid, with grating red cherry and red plum flavors. Decent red fruit character throughout but not much feel or depth.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mint, carob and green-tinged fruit aromas precede an herbal-tasting palate with olive-influenced plum, berry and cola flavors. From down south in Spain, it shows pretty good body and an okay mouthfeel, but the flavor profile is a little funky and strange.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dusty apple and mineral aromas are clean, but that's about it. The palate is lifted by blazing acids and spritz, while the flavor profile is all tangy lemon, tangerine and freshly picked green bean. Cleansing on the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Peach, melon and pithy aromas work the opening, followed by a leesy palate of mild peach, nectarine and melon flavors. It offers good flow to the finish, which features notes of sea foam, white fruit and mineral, as well as a spot of bitterness. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Crackling aromas of grapefruit, scallion, mineral and green herb are initially pungent. It feels tangy and offers plenty of zap in front of the lime, green apple and nettle flavors. It's solid on the finish, but nothing too serious or complex.",Spain,Verdejo
"Tame black-fruit aromas are leathery, darkened by asphalt and tar notes. This wine feels good and round, with plum and berry flavors that accompany resiny oak. Fruity, nice and pleasant, it doesn't announce itself as special or elevated.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Straightforward cherry and raspberry aromas carry a floral accent. It feels zesty and tight, with plum, herb and tomato flavors, with a finish that shows a vanilla note. A fresh, simple wine at every turn.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Peachy, crisp aromas are mild but standard. It feels puckery and tight, with some spritz. Flavors of tangerine, orange and lemon are tangy but not sour, while the finish is long and chalky in feel. Drink immediately.",Spain,White Blend
"Rooty aromas of licorice blend with earth, leather and cheese scents. It feels thick and chewy, with condensed flavors of grilled meat, berry, chocolate and herb. It's big and creamy on the finish, but it shows no evolution or improvement from the palate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Less pungent and angular on the bouquet than in the past, this has apple, pear and vanilla aromas. It feels soft and wide relative to previous vintages, with fleshy, almost mealy apple and papaya flavors. It's plump and melony on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"An interesting if not exactly perfect Cab Franc from central Spain. It has some of the grape's typical leafy dampness but in the mouth the wine is bright and brutally tannic, with blackberry, plum and cassis flavors. Ripe, chewy and meaty, with plenty of power and fruit but not a ton of finesse.",Spain,Cabernet Franc
"Lively right off the bat but also sort of jumbled and cheesy. The palate features red-fruit flavors and candy, while the finish is aggressively racy and a bit raw. A natural, expressive wine but one that's grabby and edgy as well. Needs both time in the glass and food to show best.",Spain,Cabernet Franc-Tempranillo
"Dusty and floral on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas and a touch of nut oil. A blend of 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura that is wet, fresh and healthy. Tastes of fresh tropical fruits and finishes with good acidity and control. There's even a slight spritz to the mouthfeel. Imported by Testa Wines Of The World. Best Buy.",Spain,White Blend
"After a leafy, somewhat burnt opening that seems muddled, things fall into place. The palate has a chewy, tannic, staunch feel that frames earthy berry, mocha, brown sugar and stewed plum flavors. It gets better and better as it unfolds, with prune and kirsch notes on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with smoky, toasty black fruit aromas that send a clear signal that this is prime stuff. The palate has a velvety, lush feel despite having big tannins, and the flavors of blackberry, cassis, fine herbs, coffee and toast scream modern, but in a melodious, clear voice. Long, deep and toasty on the finish. Drink now through 2017.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The Eguren family makes a handful of take-no-prisoners Riojas, and this is probably the best value among them. Earthy and deep; the roasted berry, ham and sweet vanilla aromas lead to a palate that's the picture of health and balance. The fruit character is outstanding as are nuances of tobacco, chocolate and spice. Drink from 2012–2020.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little more raisiny than expected, but that's offset by a brilliant floral streak and more dominant blackberry, blueberry and black plum flavors. Finishes with a mix of freshness, delicious prune fruit and chocolate. Tasted blind, like we do in almost all cases, this wine was easy to identify as Calvario; it has a uniqueness to its fruit. Drink now through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells fairly burnt and dull, with earthy, stemmy aromas that are strained and tough. The palate reflects the nose with heavy, roasted, leathery plum flavors that finish with a meaty thud. Rustic and stemmy, with a low pulse.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Jammy and flat smelling, with little to no depth to the nose. The palate is snappy but there's just enough body to offset the acidity, while the flavors of red fruits are tart and regular. Dull tasting, with a fairly long finish that's unexciting.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A green, struggling wine from front to back. The nose kicks up underripe aromas to go with distant red fruit, while the palate is edgy and prickly, with high acidity creating snappy cherry and green flavors.",Spain,Garnacha
"The nose is grassy and stalky, with fresh-cut hay and straw aromas. It tastes semisweet, just as the label promises. Look for candied apple and lime flavors with a peachy twist.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"At first this is lactic and heavy, but later it becomes charred and toasty. Its feel is full, round and fairly smooth, with baked plum, berry, vanilla and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and solid. Good for a 50,000-case production.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet black fruit, road tar and a whiff of grass makes for an interesting, attractive nose. With its medium body and medium depth, the palate shows cherry, cassis and tomato flavors, and the finish offers a rush of red fruit, tannin and brown sugar. While this doesn't bowl you over, it's good Spanish Cabernet Sauvignon, something you don't find every day.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This warm-vintage crianza has earthy black-cherry aromas along with leather, mineral and bacon. The palate is tight, with tanninc grip and narrow but tasty cherry, plum and dry herbal flavors. A savory wine with attributes and good charisma. Drink now. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"There's no shortage of power here. Forward berry aromas mixed with earth and leather ring true, while the palate is layered, broad, chewy and offers bright cherry and plum flavors. It dries out well on the finish, leaving tasty notes of pepper and herbs. From the Granada area.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nothing wrong with this crisp, tight number from Rioja. It's so clear in color that it's almost translucent, but the palate has good flavors of kiwi, green melon and lime. Precise on the tongue, with a chalky scour to the finish. It's your basic white Rioja done right. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd. Best Buy.",Spain,Viura
"Dark and deep, with cola, black fruit and truffle aromas. There's good lift to the palate, but overall it has to be classified as a dense, warm-climate wine with a big body and equally large flavors of black plum, olive and coffee. Seems short and a little simple on the finish.",Spain,Monastrell
"A bit rubbery and smoky on the nose, with some hardness. Airing reveals raspberry and vanilla aromas, while the palate carries some jolt due to sizable acids. Tastes like a burst of red plum and pie cherry, while the finish is tannic, long and full of leftover red fruit. More than respectable for La Mancha Syrah. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Spain,Syrah
"The rose petal and kirsch aromas are easy to like, with notes of tobacco and smoky earth in the mix. It feels good, easygoing and mature, with raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Cool, collected and mature as a whole, this is ready now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Hard, pickled aromas settle on leathery and burnt after airing. The palate is jammy and sticky, with sweet, heavy, roasted, burnt-tasting black fruit flavors. Resiny as well. Tempranillo with 10% Syrah.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This wine's floral cherry and raspberry aromas aren't fancy, but they set up a solid-feeling wine, with black cherry, maple and raisin flavors. It turns sweet-tasting on the finish, with brown sugar and chocolate notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earth and leather notes combine with woodsy, perfumed aromas to form a good nose. This has racy acidity and raspberry flavor, enhanced by dry spice. It finishes with light resin but maintains brightness.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Always consistent is Blanco Nieva's Verdejo. The nose is clean and inviting, with apple and pineapple aromas. The palate is full and fruity, with a zesty set of flavors that include nectarine, orange and mango. Clean and smooth on the finish, and maybe a touch sweet. Drink now. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Verdejo
"This wine impressed us more now than when we tried it last year. It is showing commendable intensity and concentration, and while it seems slightly medicinal, it brings on the plum and baked-fruit flavors. Probably a bit more heavy and mushy than ideal, but we like the wine's ripeness and dark flavors.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc
"Sweet and fragrant, with off-the-grid aromas of blueberry and exotic spice. It's 50% Monastrell along with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Tempranillo, and overall the wine has healthy acids, a hot finish and spicy flavors of brandied cherry and plum. Thick and substantive, but a little fiery.",Spain,Red Blend
"This starts out with mustard and horseradish aromas, but with the chance to breath, it reveals a dark berry scent. The palate feels tannic and sticky, with flavors of cooked plum, hard spice and brown sugar. It's grabby, fiery and full of flavor on the finish, with a slightly abrasive feel.",Spain,Red Blend
"Ribera del Duero wines in this price range are few and far between, so while Vivir, Vivir starts with some classic RDD funk and leather, it soon rises to the occasion by showing plump black-fruit flavors, a wet and balanced mouthfeel, and classic pepper and bitter chocolate on the finish. A good wine if your expectations are not too high.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A strong, blunt and fairly appealing wine with cola/root beer aromas along with tobacco and raisin on the nose. The palate is driving and lively, with a mix of berry, coffee and resiny flavors sharing center stage. It's a tad rough and unfamiliar, but that's Utiel-Requena boiled down to its essence.",Spain,Bobal
"Roasted on the nose, with big scoopings of rubber, leather and raisiny fruit. The palate leans toward red-fruit flavors, but the feel is jangled and acidic. By the time you get to the finish your palate is worn out. Desperately needs food to show its best.",Spain,Red Blend
"A rough and tumble blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. It starts out with forceful, cheesy oak that gives way to dark plum, bramble and oak-resin flavors, while the finish shows tannin and tomato leaf flavors. It's full, tough and different from all the polished, international wines that dominate the marketplace.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rich, smoky and heady, with earthy black fruit aromas that fold in mocha and vanilla. The palate runs fairly crisp and firm for a big wine, with black cherry, spice, peppercorn and herbal flavors. Super lively, tight and showing cola and lemon peel on the woody finish. Drink from 2012–2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy smelling but also lean and minty. The palate is almost sour, a bit better later on, but never does it rise above tight, lean and tart. Mesache means youthful but youth is wasted on the young in this case. Garnacha, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and the indigenous Parraleta.",Spain,Red Blend
"Although this is dense, rubbery and leathery on the nose, with airing the rubbery notes dissolve. It feels snappy and medium in body, with good concentration and flavors of raspberry, toast and herb. Dry, peppery and short on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Apple and mineral aromas are solid and fresh but don't deliver much kick. This feels lively, with a mix of citrus flavors that are enhanced by grass and a pithy finish. It ends on a green note, with a hint of scallion and a cut of acidity.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Rubbery and minty on the nose, this wine has cherry and raspberry scents in the background. It feels edgy, tannic and grabby, with roasted berry and a touch of bitterness. Clampy, drying and warm on the finish, it has an herbal edge.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Coarse on the nose, this has scratchy aromas of unripe red fruit, green herb and grass. It feels forward but choppy, with zesty acidity pushing its familiar flavors of red fruit and herb. A bit stalky and leathery on the finish, it ends with a vanilla streak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Never a bad buy and almost always a Best Buy, this Viura from Cáceres impresses via its clean, stony nose and pure nectarine, apple and citrus flavors. It isn't complex, but by the same token it isn't candied, artificial or phony. One of our perennial favorites among value-priced white wines. Imported by Vineyard Brands. Best Buy.",Spain,White Blend
"Dark, sweet and arguably a little raisiny on the nose. That sweetness translates into a thick mouthfeel cemented by weight and a tannic grip. The flavor profile is moderately baked, with berry, chocolate and molasses flavors, while the finish is long but tastes a touch cooked. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A full and good wine with limits. Opens with fresh, floral aromas and a bit of oak, while the palate seems almost tart at first but then delivers snappy cherry and plum flavors. Acidity and tannin keep it lively on the finish, while overall we find the wine solid and ready to go. A blend of Tempranillo and Merlot.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Dark in color, this has an inviting mix of herb, spice, black plum and roasted berry aromas. It shows good balance and saturation across the palate, with staunch tannins and a creamy feel. Flavors of black fruits, tobacco and vanilla are generous, while the finish is not at all angular, choppy or challenging. Drink now–2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Floral plum and blueberry aromas are exotic and interesting as opposed to heavy and oaky. Shows rubbery tannins and a wide mouthfeel in front of roasted berry and plum flavors. Savory on the back end, with an oak character that's not too demanding.",Spain,Mencía
"This is black and tarry on first take, but complex aromas of pine, baked plum and wood smoke emerge. It has a nice full body and a few levels of texture, while the wine's dark plum and berry flavors are generously spiced. This is composed, full and grabby on the finish. Drink now through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A touch scratchy on the bouquet, with a red berry aroma and a wild herb note. It feels fresh and decidedly “red” in style, with red plum and red currant flavors. More easygoing than brooding, this finishes light. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Red Blend
"Leather and smoky berry aromas lead to a lively, racy palate that's tight, crisp and traditional in feel. The plum, berry and earth flavors are old school—more elegant and restrained than pushy and forward. Long and chiseled on the finish, this is a blend of five grapes including Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache.",Spain,Red Blend
"What a difference a year makes: 2008 yielded a fine wine, but the warmer 2009 vintage has produced a classic Cava with pretty aromas of apples and fresh green herbs. It feels chiseled and tight, with a mix of green apple, peach and nectarine flavors. Smooth and easy on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Beautifully composed, with power and just as much precision and pizzazz. The nose offers lightly baked berry fruit notes, leather and spice, while the palate is loaded with tobacco, exotic spices and the finest natural berry flavors Spain has to offer. Smooth, elegant, finessed and potent, with integrated tannins and bold acidity that will keep it going for at least a decade. Drink from 2012 through 2018.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"This vintage of Fontal, a basic crianza from La Mancha, shows structure, some tannin and body, and finally solid cherry and plum fruit. With a blast of obvious oak and a forward personality, it makes its point.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Simple but steady and composed. This is throwback-style Rioja crianza, meaning it's moderately oaked and not very fat or expressive. Strawberry and cherry flavors run the show, and the mouthfeel is fresh. More innocuous than detailed, which means it'll do fine by-the-glass.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Blueberry and raisin aromas announce ripeness. This wine feels jammy but vital, with a prune flavor and a lightly roasted note. Although the wine becomes a little too soft at the end, it's flavorful and dense. A good match for a hamburger or steak sandwich.",Spain,Garnacha
"An animal cracker aroma accompanies notes of peach and mineral. Spritzy, fresh and citrusy in the mouth, this features orange and peach flavors. The finish has a pithy bitterness.",Spain,Albariño
"Plum, berry, vanilla and plastic aromas dominate the nose. The mouthfeel features drying tannins that are offset by refreshing acids. The flavors consist of berry, resiny oak and vanilla. It definitely shows its oak on the finish, which is plump in feel and solidly structured.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dry and fiery, with leaf and herb aromas going head to head with light raspberry. The palate has some depth and sweetness to it, and at the core it's showing cherry, plum and spice flavors. True to the blueprint of traditional Rioja but not a lot beyond the basics. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"By no means is this an easy wine to like or understand. It begins with murky, earthy aromas and then unfolds to deliver marzipan and sweet berry fruit. Massive is an understatement, as the wine's tannic grab and density are over the top. There aren't many good high-priced Cabs from Spain; take this as a good explanation why not. Imported by Kobrand.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Pungent and sweaty smelling, and even though it's 50% Verdejo and 50% Viura, it's the Verdejo that stands out. Fresh and flashy in the mouth, with lively lime, gooseberry and green apple flavors. And the finish is zesty and wet, with plenty of acidity and spritz. Imported by Grapes of Spain. Best Buy.",Spain,White Blend
"The funky blue bottle aside, this is a good, lightweight, clean Viura that shouldn't steer anyone wrong. Nice pear and apple aromas are basic but welcoming, and the tangerine and green apple flavors are crisp and whet the whistle. Best for simple quaffing. Imported by Admiral Imports. Best Buy.",Spain,White Blend
"Darker, denser and more raisiny than your average varietal Graciano, this wine is almost pruney and horsey. But it settles down to offer solid but chunky black plum, prune and balsamic flavors. The finish is stocky but not flabby. Meaty and solid for Graciano. Imported by Baron Francois Ltd.",Spain,Graciano
"Get at this wine while it's still fresh and you'll likely enjoy its pineapple, apple and mango essence. It's a bit plump and oily in terms of feel, but overall it gets things right as it pours on the fresh pineapple on both the palate and   finish. Imported by Luneau USA Inc. Best Buy.",Spain,Verdejo
"Hard, crusty leather is the opening aroma, then a touch of tar gives way to notes of tobacco, latent oak and perfumed, mature fruit. It feels full, grabby and on the cusp of being syrupy, with roasted berry and spice flavors. It shows an herbal, hot side on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Focused and fresh, this has aromas of berry and integrated citrus. It feels rubbery and lush, with acidic cut and roasted flavors of plum, blackberry and leather. It finishes mildly roasted and earthy, with a leathery lasting impression.",Spain,Red Blend
"Toasty oak and hickory aromas are the primary greeting, with licorice, pastry and blackberry notes underneath. It feels saturated and chewy, with full-scale berry, prune, chocolate and mossy flavors. It's dense on the finish, with smooth tannins and heft.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This gets going with clean, light cherry and berry aromas that bring a citrus note to the fore. It feels crisp, dry and pure, with citrus, plum and dust flavors. An elegant rosé made from the Trepat grape, it finishes dry and spicy, with ample leftover fruit.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Talk about magnetic aromas of bacon, tobacco and bold black fruit, and then comes an oak-rich palate full of coconut, butter, chocolate and exotic berry flavor. Chocolate truffle and pastry work the finish, and overall this is a mile-deep beauty to drink from 2011 through 2017.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Make room in the cellar for this heavyweight! Talk about a monster wine; but there's also finesse, character and style to it. Alabaster is the top wine from the Eguren family's new Toro winery, and it's big, tannic and loaded with spice, molasses and syrupy black fruit flavors. Rich, long and fierce on the finish, with tannins and heat to resolve. Best from 2012 through 2020.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"If you like old-fashioned country fruit supported by a forest's worth of oak, then this is probably up your alley. It's a rusty, aging wine with mossy, murky aromas of roast plum and carob. The palate is fading in terms of fruit, but there's a whole lot of vanilla, dill and resin in wait. Still lively but a little too oaky and thin.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Somontano wines are not always easy to love due to firm acidity and limited flesh and fluff. Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon account for 70% of this lean, solidly oaked wine that revolves around its tangy raspberry and cherry core. Freshness and Old World restraint characterize Marboré.",Spain,Red Blend
"Quite sweet on the nose, with cherry-cola, berry jam and other sweet berry fruit flavors. There's not a whole lot of dryness to this red-colored, red-riding Cava. But it's just balanced enough if you're looking for bold berry flavors and a splash of acidity.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Expect no shortage of power and pounding tannins from this modern-styled, heavily extracted Tempranillo. The nose is dark, sweet and jammy, but all pleasantries cease there; the palate is tannic as nails, with baked plum and other roasted dark-fruit flavors. To this taster, it's a hard, tough wine. Others may find it more appealing.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Earthy dark-berry aromas come with moderate spice. It feels fresh and shows solid grip on the palate, along with notes of plum, blackberry, vanilla, dill and tobacco. Short and dry on the finish, it has a minty accent.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Tight-grained oak aromas give off qualities of tobacco and spice that are met with a touch of raspberry. Fruity, it fits the equation of classic Rioja: It delivers light strawberry, raspberry, plum and vanilla flavors on a fresh, acid-driven frame.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty, spicy and a little scratchy on the nose, this has leather, vanilla and mild fruit aromas. It feels tangy, with a light herb flavor working in tandem with dry plum and berry notes. Briary, spicy and drying on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Inky and jammy upfront, this has cheesy leather and berry aromas. It feels good, with ripe tannins and a flavor profile of juicy berry and cherry that lacks some complexity. The finish is awash in ripe, powerful berry.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is pretty neutral on the nose, except for the saline, citrus and pear aromas. It feels juicy, fresh and average, with slightly sweet flavors of kiwi, lime and white grapefruit. It turns more pithy as it finishes.",Spain,Verdejo
"Just like the previous vintage, this is a melony, fresh wine with apple aromas backed by a semi-creamy palate of peach and banana. It has a soft outlook but it isn't flabby, and thus a slight finishing note of powdered sugar and vanilla frosting seems right. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd. Best Buy.",Spain,Viura
"Slightly baked and raisiny, with aromas of black currants and blackberry jam. The palate pushes some zest and kick, while the raspberry and plum flavors are best initially and then break up before a simple finish. Offers a good midlevel taste of Priorato. Imported by Fine Estates From Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"An interesting white wine based on Chardonnay and Xarello. It's like Cava without the fizz, and the nose starts out dry and like Sherry before green apple and lime come into view. Tastes really dry and chalky, with mineral and apple at its core. Imported by Organic Vintners.",Spain,White Blend
"Rusty in color, this has a baked fruit aromas suggestive of raisin, cherry and plum. It's thick, but it maintains freshness due to the solid acidity. This feels heavy, with robust flavors of roasted plum and blackberry, but the finish isn't cloying.",Spain,Garnacha
"Rusty in color, this is loaded with dill, tobacco, lemon peel and spice aromas. It feels choppy and jagged on its own, but will do better with food. Flavors of rooty, roasted berries are savory and baked, while the finish is dry and pinched. Drink now–2014.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is always a really good buy among rosé sparklers and a personal favorite in the Best Buy category. It opens with red fruit, vanilla and yeasty aromas, but it's racy, crisp and refined in the mouth, with nectarine, peach and controlled citrus flavors. It's dry, spicy and fairly smooth on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Notes of baked-berry, herb and savory spice come together well on the bouquet. It feels chunky and round but lively, with plum and cassis flavors that carry an herbal, tomatoey shading. This is fresh and herbal enough so that you know it's Old World.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive. The palate is ripe, rich and just forward enough, with blackberry, wild berry, coffee and fudge flavors. Settles nicely on the finish, and overall this wine shows almost all of what's good about modern Ribera del Duero wines. 250 cases made; drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Outstanding Sherry with complexity, richness and character. The nose has a salinic zest to it, making it no wallflower, and of course there's raisin and prune. The palate is formed, sculpted and balanced, with peanut M&M;'s candy, roasted fruit, chocolate ice cream and more. A beauty with power and poise.",Spain,Sherry
"This is the tier-two wine from the Egurens' new Toro project, and it's stellar. Intense aromas of black fruit, char and mint start it out, and next up come cola, roasted black fruit, clove and cured-meat flavors. Oak is forward now, but it should settle in a year or so. A dynamite Toro to drink from 2011 through 2018.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A wonderfully balanced and giving wine with sweet raisin and prune aromas and an overall richness akin to crude oil. Flavors of baked black plum, brown sugar and molasses are both juicy and rich, and then toffee and mocha take over on the finish. Sweet and thick for sure, but with discernible fruit and vitality.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Fairly gassy and sulfuric off the bat, so the nose isn't ideal. Patience will be partially rewarded with jammy strawberry and raspberry flavors along with mocha. However, it never does fully get rolling. It settles on solid but midlevel red-fruit flavors and a similar mouthfeel.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"An ordinary but competent Rioja. The fruit is light but young and fresh; the palate touches on raspberry and plum. A bit of mineral and natural bitterness work the finish, and overall this is a no-complaints kind of $10 wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly reduced but still balanced enough to give off a positive early impression. The wine is sweet, almost syrupy, but it's that same ripeness that gives it more oomph and richness than most under-$10 wines. Finishes baked and almost stewy, but if you get at it early it should deliver all the black fruit and size one can expect from a value-priced offering.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly prickly and peppery on the nose, but there's enough clean red-fruit aromas and dustiness to bring it along. The palate is simple and nice enough, with tight acidity, stanching dryness and zest. A good but limited wine that delivers what it should but nothing beyond that.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dry melon and papaya aromas are common and proper for Cava. The palate, however, is ultrasweet and is weighted down by the wine's dosage. In the end, it's a candied type of bubbly that finishes cloyingly sweet and creamy. Best for fans of sweet white wines.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Mildy green and drying on the nose, with bramble and leather along with distant red fruit. The palate is soft, light and fluid, with mild raspberry and plum flavors. Shows oak and resin on the finish, where fruit and structure are in short supply.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little sluggish on the nose, but if you concentrate on the feel and overall balance the wine grades out fairly well. The flavors run from pickled raspberry to salty plum, and never is the wine very sweet or rich. Conversely, it settles on tight and lean, with juiciness rather than pulp.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Simple floral and sweet-fruit aromas are good, while the palate runs creamy and thick, with dull-edged plum, berry and chocolate flavors. This is a round, uncut wine that fits the description of your basic country crianza. Imported by USA Wines Inc.",Spain,Bobal
"Quite tannic and biting, but beyond those mouthfeel issues this affordable RDD has its positives. The bouquet of toast, mocha and coconut is alluring, and then the palate of dark-fruit flavors, while rock-hard, is masculine. But never does one escape the feel and balance shortcomings. It's a like a ride down a pocked and bumpy gravel road.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Warm and earthy at first, but more soupy as it opens. Crisp, snappy red-fruit flavors are also on the herbal side. Nervy yet it does show a reasonable amount of honest Rioja quality. Still, for a 2001 reserva it doesn't amount to much.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Young and bouncy, and that's to be expected from this type of juvenile Tempranillo. However, should you like full-fruit young wines with force and no oak, it's not at all bad. Expect juicy black cherry and other runaway flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Simultaneously snappy and creamy on the nose. The palate is a touch tangy and raw, but there's enough clean Garnacha fruit coming in raspberry/cherry flavors that it warrants more than a single pass. A little grabby and tight on the finish, but it rates as a good country wine. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",Spain,Garnacha
"Rock solid and dense, with aromas of black cherry and cassis along with a whiff of aged cheese. The palate is tight, tannic and rubbery, with grabby black cherry and blackberry flavors along with toasty, dark shadings. Finishes firm, with a touch of black olive and herbs. The best MC to date; drink now through 2017.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Modest and generally clean on the nose, this features little more than a touch of berry. It feels tight and juicy, with citrus flavor and not much complexity. A note of pink grapefruit shows up on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Light pink in color, this has chewing gum, watermelon and dust aromas. It is underwhelming on the palate, with a simple mouthfeel and flavors of cotton candy and cherry.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This wine's grassy plum and berry aromas have a lactic angle. It feels full but gripping, with pasty floral flavors that leave a grabby residue on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Grenache
"This wine explores the fresher, racier side of the Priorat region. Berry fruit with just the slightest hint of raisin dominates the nose and the palate. Flavors of red plum and raspberry are borderline scouring, but then the finish gives some mocha and sage to bring everything into focus. Best with food; drink now. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Tropical and easy to like. We don't see many white Garnachas in the U.S., but this one shows mango, melon and vanilla on the nose and the palate follows up with lychee, apple and baking spice flavors. Plump and mellow but with adequate acidity; refreshing while it's young. Drink now. Imported by Grapes of Spain. Best Buy.",Spain,Grenache Blanc
"Gritty, granular and a bit raisiny at first, and then more settled later on. For Monastrell this is snappy, dry and solid, with cherry, raspberry, plum and vanilla forming a standard flavor package. The finish offers a bit of chocolate cream, but overall it's basic, tannic and full, with some bite.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is slightly smoky, toasty and yeasty up front, with a touch of matchstick to the nose. Rich, sweet tasting and candied on the palate, it has baking spice, apple and honeydew flavors. It's tasty throughout and just elevated enough in mouthfeel to earn a few complexity points.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This leans a little green and soda-like on the nose, but it picks up clarity and speed on the palate, which carries a tangy, citric snap. It tastes of citrus and lees, and the finish is medium in length and healthy.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Roasted plum, baked berry and jammy aromas can't be missed, but it's structured and not at all soft in the mouth, with wild berry, cherry and boysenberry flavors. It really pours on the fruit, ending fresh with no nonsense.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dry, toasty and composed up front, this has a nice palate set straight by proper acidity and base structure. Citrus and brown sugar flavors feature a note of orange rind, and it stays fresh and citrusy on the finish. Made from Trepat.",Spain,Trepat
"Nice, brawny and integrated, with sexy aromas of wild berry, dark plum, leather and earth. The palate has the right weight and tannic grab, while the flavors of black fruit, fine herbs, cola and coffee are measured yet generous. Finishes with driving chocolate and vanilla flavors. Drink now through 2016.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Teso la Monja is the new Toro winery from the Eguren family of Rioja fame (former owners of Numanthia-Termes in Toro), and it's proof that no beat has been missed since they sold out to Moët Hennessy. Expect dark, intense black fruit aromas and flavors mixed with heat, tannin, cola and spice. Some oak creeps out on the finish, but overall this is a lovely, bullish Toro. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A bit funky and gassy on the nose, and while the wine offers ripeness and sweetness on the palate, there's always a little something strange and sulfuric lingering. It has its plum and acidity, but the tannins and overall mouthfeel are grabby.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Burnt oak, tire rubber and bramble vie with blackberry and vanilla aromas. The palate is brambly and a little lean, with strawberry and raspberry flavors taking on some grassy wildness. Simply stated, the fruit flavors just aren't of the highest order. Otherwise, it's good enough.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A bit aggressive, with handsoap and citrus aromas. The palate is lean and clean, with lemon juice, grapefruit and lime flavors. Any way you look at it, this is an apéritif wine. Expect more from what amounts to a basic Viura and you're asking too much.",Spain,White Blend
"Red in color and pretty clean on the nose, where raspberry and rose petal essence come together. The palate is acidic and tight, with tangy watermelon and peach flavors carrying the cleansing finish. Juicy to the extreme, but a good partner for food.",Spain,Rosé
"We didn't go crazy over the 2005 and the '06 Sentido is also challenged. It's soft, raisiny and borderline overripe. The flavors are roasted and short, with low acidity, soft tannins and plenty of toast and coffee on the black finish. More baked than vivacious, with some excess weight.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Our bet is that a granular, reduced, raisiny wine like this will not have broad appeal. Yet if you are interested in trying a blend of Samsó, Garnacha and Syrah it has some core qualities, namely old-school raisin and plum flavors backed by core tannins. A country-style wine if there ever was one.",Spain,Red Blend
"Melon and green fruit aromas have a pinch of almond bitterness. This feels fresh but low in volume, with standard apple and green melon flavors. It finishes soft, with notes of mustard seed and fennel.",Spain,Verdejo
"Opens with hard, ripe, almost forced aromas, which settle with air. The palate is wiry, firm and a touch hot, with cola, raspberry and plum flavors that rattle around on a bed of racy acidity. Finishes rather lean and raw, but with honest flavors of Garnacha and Carignan, which comprise 90% of the blend. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromatically forward, with rubbery blackberry and grilled meat aromas. When it settles it shows grapey flavors and a chewy mouthfeel. Grabby, alert and snappy on the finish; this wine doesn't lack bounce or kick.",Spain,Red Blend
"Nice black cherry, cracked pepper and a slight wave of perfume make the nose attractive, while the palate is bright and a touch sharp with red-fruit flavors. Cherry, red plum and gentle spice notes work the finish, and overall the wine seems honest and well made.",Spain,Garnacha
"Lightly fragrant and fruity on the nose, with earth and leather to give it meaning. The palate is medium-weight, with fresh berry and cherry flavors along with finishing notes of pepper and tobacco. Rumbles along like a good, everyday, classic Rioja. A throwback in style. Imported by Palm Bay International.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The aromas of orange and mineral are uncomplicated and friendly. It feels pure and offers good flow, with apple, lime, mineral, white pepper and anise flavors. Fruity, dry and composed on the finish, this is great wine for patio sipping or pairing with seafood.",Spain,White Blend
"Cherry cough drop, raspberry and minerally aromas settle on the nose. This four-grape blend shows a lively palate that's dry and crisp in feel, with raspberry, plum and red pepper flavors that lead to a tight finish that peters out quickly.",Spain,Red Blend
"Jammy berry, light mint and herb notes carry a jumpy nose to a palate that has oak-infused plum, raspberry and light herb flavors. It finishes mostly calm and collected, but also a touch racy, with a pastry flavor.",Spain,Red Blend
"Clean, stylish and easy to like, this has apple and green herb aromas. It shows a good weight and mouthfeel, with papaya, thyme and baked apple flavors. Medium long and smooth on the finish, this is a commendable value-priced bubbly.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Toasty and a touch oily on the nose, this has green fruit aromas of lime and kiwi. It shows crisp tartness on the palate, with a touch of grapefruit and core flavors of nectarine and orange. It's dry on the quick finish, with a touch of almond skin.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Rich and pruney, with bold, reduced black fruit aromas along with chocolate and spice. Compact and delicious in the mouth, with caramel, black coffee and other yummy, unctuous flavors. So thick it pours like motor oil, thus feel free to drink it like a wine or pour it on vanilla ice cream as you might a syrup.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"The first couple of passes are not that encouraging: there's strawberry Kool-Aid and sharp field-like aromas of thistle and bramble. But the palate is not bad at all; it is flush yet racy, with solid raspberry and plum flavors that carry onto the finish. Not a refined wine but a natural one.",Spain,Garnacha
"A bit cheesy and funky, with rhubarb and leather along with baked berry aromas. The palate feels fine, but the flavors are leathery and sort of salty, with touches of pepper and herbs as well. Not as ripe and appealing as what we're looking for from a Rioja reserva.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Solid but unspectacular on the nose, with plum scents and generic sweetness. The palate is also sweet, but it has enough acidity and tannin to create a serious, almost scratchy mouthfeel. And if you hadn't had enough sweetness up to this point, the finish is loaded with brown sugar, cola and cough medicine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"By no means a special wine but it does deliver full-force if generic dark-fruit aromas and flavors. The nose is a little hard and rubbery, but that's Utiel-Requena for you. Medium-bodied but not harsh or burnt; prune and blackberry flavors linger. Tempranillo and Syrah. Wines Imported by USA Wines Inc.",Spain,Red Blend
"Bramble and burning brush on the nose, while the palate is murky as it delivers tomato leaf, baked plum and carob flavors. Seems sort of cooked and funky, with a muddled mouthfeel. The 2005 is a cleaner, more focused wine.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dill, cheese and mossy fruit give this wine a less than super bouquet. The palate is light, with strawberry flavors mixed with some peppery, herbal overtones. Short on the finish; not much bang for the buck.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cloudy in appearance but fairly clear on the nose and palate. Rhubarb and cherry aromas give this an austere, red-fruit bouquet, and the palate rests on racy cherry and doesn't budge. Lean late in the game, with coffee and bitterness to the thin, mildly grating finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lean, dry raspberry aromas and a slight floral essence carry the nose toward a zesty, semisharp palate with crisp cherry and cranberry flavors. Not bad in a lean, stripped-back way; but there's no excess oak, weight or sweetness. Lean stuff for old-school palates nursing plates of ham or salami.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dry herb and spice aromas precede a solid, drawn-down palate, with lively acidity and flavors of medium-dark berry, toast and herb. Modest in intensity, this is composed.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Fiery berry and cherry aromas emerge with a hint of milk chocolate. This wine feels high in acidity, with raspberry, tart red plum and spice flavors that finish with citrusy snap and grittiness.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Narrow but perfectly acceptable on the nose, with white fruit aromas, this may not have much feel and style, but the flavors of soda cracker, lime and apple are dry, ending on a baking spice note.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"With Ribera wines there's an assumption of tannic presence, but this older vintage, while displaying a classy bouquet, is brutally tannic, with an acid-washed palate. Splashes of cranberry and plum flavors are cut by lemony acidity and drying sandpaper tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Gold in color, this has chunky aromas of oily white fruit and sea water. Thick in feel, it nevertheless has enough acidity to protect the wine's body and integrity. It tastes of orange and nectarine, before falling flat and mealy on the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Gritty and tough, but amid the rough tannins and bite there is red plum, licorice candy and brown sugar sweetness. Flavors of berry fruit and raisin cover the racy and sweet ends of the spectrum, while the finish is tight to the point of being raw.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"An unusual blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Picapoll that hits with apple and melon aromas. The palate is soda-like, with zest, spritz and tangy lemon-lime and green apple flavors. Dry, pithy and a little strange in its flavor profile. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,White Blend
"Pungent and sweaty like Verdejo, and definitely not Albariño as we know it. This Castillian white starts out strong and sweaty, like hockey gear left too long in the bag. But the flavors of pink grapefruit, kiwi and lime are good, and the feel is fleshy if a bit flat. Finishes pithy and citric. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,White Blend
Not for everyone but not a bad sweet wine for desserts and cheeses. The nose is hard to describe but the palate and flavors are familiar: sweet applesauce and sugared pastry along with mango and candy. Decent acidity keeps it fresh and moving forward. Imported by Admiral Imports.,Spain,White Blend
"Earthy, leafy compost aromas are initially evident on the nose, and while the wine has some feel issue due to an abundance of raw tannins, it eventually rounds out and delivers oily, herbal flavors of blackberry and plum. Dark and muscular, but also aggressive and beefy. Seems a little untamed for a Telmo Rodriguez wine. Imported by Vintus LLC.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Meaty, dense, savory and extremely oaky and dark on the nose. Feels tannic and tough, with intensity to spare and tons of black-fruit flavor that turns more toasted, roasted and barbecued as the wine unfolds. Finishes with burnt meat and mint flavors along with grinding tannins. Needs another 3 or 4 years, and even then it may not be a soft, friendly Mencía.",Spain,Mencía
"Deep purple in color, with roasted, rubbery aromas of wild blackberry. Thick, lush and rich in the mouth, with mellow tannins (for a Priorat wine) and big, broad flavors of plum, blackberry and herbs. Smooth on the finish, with black tea notes and leftover oak. Has a lot going for it; drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"A genuinely attractive, well-made old vines red with earthy, minerally aromas along with violet petal and blackberry. The palate has a fine feel to it, depth and complexity, while flavors of dry berry and baking spices work wonders. Dry, pure and long on the finish, and really quite excellent for a vino de tierra. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The only sweetness on offer is on the nose. After that, things go lightweight and tangy, leaving a racy feel and semiastringent cherry flavors. A real sizzler with zesty red fruit and not much else.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Simple, candied cava is what this is. The nose deals red licorice and cherry, while the palate is bubbly and plump, with plum and raspberry flavors. Not much detail but plenty of size and carbonation.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Meaty and very oaky, with resin, mocha and milky aromas that amount to a wood cutter's dream. Not surprisingly, the mouthfeel is more shocking and acidic than the oaky bouquet suggests; flavors are racy and tart, and then a bitter lactic quality comes on strong. Too much going on, with nothing pulling in the same direction.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Blocky and brambly on the nose, with a fair amount of funk. The palate is crisp, semitart and lean-bodied, and with tight acidity it's a little scouring. Lots of red-fruit character but not a lot of mouthfeel.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pickle and sweet funk on the nose give this chunky wine a nose that's less than fresh. Flavors of orange, peach and cantaloupe are sweet but flat, and in the end it tastes more like a fruit juice than a really solid dry rosé.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite an unusual specimen in that you don't often see Monastrell mixed with Cabernet and Shiraz. The end result is fairly strange and unfamiliar; the nose smells saucy and lean, while the palate is also saucy and a touch medicinal.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rusty in color but natural, which is also this wine's downfall. It has no dosage, so what's left is leafy, herbal Pinot Noir aromas and flavors. It's peachy, drying and zesty, but also saddled with tomato leaf and rhubarb. Such is the life of Brut Nature rosé.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"The name boasts of balance but we find mostly pine needle, skunk and eventually creamy red-fruit aromas followed by lean, tangy stawberry and cherry flavors. Light fruit and simple oak is all that's here.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A little scratchy on the nose, but otherwise it exudes pure aromas of cassis and raspberry. The palate is juicy, racy and snappy but full and structured, while the flavors of raspberry, plum and blackberry get sweetness in the form of coconut and vanilla-infused coffee. Less soft and bodied than previous vintages but a big winner nonetheless.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The nose is floral and earthy, with light berry aromas. It feels a bit clacky, with lemon-driven acidity in front of oaky, savory, earthy berry flavors. This is taut and a little warm on the finish, with savory, salty flavors and a clipped feel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells mildly grassy and green at first, while balsamic vinegar and tobacco notes enter the frame later on. It's solid and average in mouthfeel, with a slightly sweet and syrupy berry flavor that's tempered by tomato-driven acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells foxy and jumpy, with a candied cherry aroma. Fresh and forward, scratchy and rough, this has raspberry, plum and resiny oak flavors. It breaks down and turns somewhat metallic on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Green melon and lettuce aromas are fresh and clean. The wine feels solid and good, and there's a jumble of baked apple and melon flavors. Yeasty on the finish, it's made entirely from Macabeo grapes.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Initally it smells rubbery and nutty, with a baked, earthy personality. With airing, it opens somewhat but remains leathery and cheesy. This feels fairly full, with baked, toasty flavors of herb, berry and plum. It is moderately long on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy berry, blueberry and spice aromas meet the nose, followed by a narrow palate that turns softer as the wine airs out. Flavors of jammy berry and raisin end on a mellow, chewy finish. A soft Garnacha for casual consumption.",Spain,Garnacha
"Moderately leafy and brambly smelling, this is supported by its berry aroma. It feels edgy and juicy, with tangy, herbal raspberry and plum flavors. The finish is quick and snappy, with a hint of tomato and lasting green flavor.",Spain,Red Blend
"Floral berry aromas are fresh and carry only the slightest grassy, green element. The wine feels crisp and tight, with nice red plum and raspberry flavors. Mild, focused and not very hefty or thick on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Clean as polished glass, with touches of red plum and cherry on the nose. The palate is fresh and balanced, but basic and moderate in terms of flavors. Finishes with light cherry and raspberry notes. Garnacha with 30% white Viura. Imported by Admiral Imports. Best Buy.",Spain,Rosé
"If basic Argentinean Torrontés is to your liking, so will this be. It's fresh and green on the nose, with melon and lychee aromas. Those fruits carry onto the palate, where lemon-lime and crystallized mango flavors are sweet but crisped up by snappy acidity. Serve chilled. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,White Blend
"Big and baked, with aromas of cheese and leather offsetting sweet black fruit. Flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate are as baked and sweet as the nose, and the feel is grabby and leaves a sugary residue on the finish. Wants to be a modern, ripe wine but proves to be simple and overdone. Imported by The Portfolio Group.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of barrel spice and grilled pineapple are solid, while the palate is thick and creamy with orange marmalade and banana flavors. If you like a thick, unctuous Chard with a glob of oak, this is it. Has its strong points but tastes too much like cinnamon stick and wood. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Spice and leather aromas are positive while the smells of burnt leaves and green herbs aren't too appealing. The palate is big and wide with a mix of cherry cough drop, plum and burnt coffee flavors. And the finish evaporates fast, leaving heat and medicinal notes.",Spain,Red Blend
"Minty smelling, with herbal red fruit and rhubarb scents. The wine is clack, clack, clack on the palate as acids and snappy red fruit draw everything down to the base level. Flavors of raspberry and light vanilla are clean but high-toned, and there's an undercurrent of tomato. A tough wine from a vintage to forget.",Spain,Red Blend
"A touch green and grassy at the start, with cinnamon, cherry candy and red-fruit aromas. The palate is fresh and snappy, with sweet berry flavors and just a slight bit of resin and/or green character. Finishes light and quick, making it an easygoing red wine that isn't meant for deep analysis.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is a unique wine from Mallorca with light cherry and raspberry aromas. Clampy, dry and tannic on the palate, it's full of savory, roasted barbecue flavors along with tomato and red fruit notes. Very Mallorcan in that it's salty and savory from start to finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on. Impressive depth of flavor, nice overall balance and a mix of complexity and flat-out richness make this PX a winner.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Round, stylish and wholesome on the nose, with wild berry, smoke, spice and not too much obvious oak. The palate is racy and forward, but also offers subtleties including dry fruit, spice, fresh tomato and wild herbs such as thyme and sage. Long and warm on the finish, with vanilla. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Another impressive Oloroso from Gonzalez Byass. This is a sweet, dark, brooding Sherry with prune and other sweet fruit aromas. The palate is rich but has good flow, while dark flavors of dulce de leche and burnt brown sugar are wonderful. Sweet but balanced by mild coffee-like bitterness on the finish.",Spain,Sherry
"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Almost volatile, but with reduced raisin below. If you are familiar with   hot-climate California Zinfandel, this is not unlike that. It has a vinegary attack and then a strange but limited sweetness lurking in the weeds. A   challenged wine.",Spain,Red Blend
"Very dark and seemingly on the cooked side of the ledger. The nose is black and raisiny, while the core flavors are saucy. At least this meaty, overdone Garnacha isn't oaked, so in that sense it isn't offensive. But it is definitely soft, and without much future.",Spain,Garnacha
"Airén is a big-crop white grape that is usually distilled into brandy or made into Sherry. But here we see it as a dry white table wine, and while it is limited in scope, the wine's punch-bowl approach and cleansing lime and kiwi flavors are decent.",Spain,Airen
"Apple and powdery citrus aromas are austere but intriguing. But in the mouth, this thing foams like bubble bath. No matter whether you like the wine's citric flavors and apple essence or not, the fact that it bubbles up like a shaken soda is not an attribute. Oriel's gran reserva is similar in terms of carbonation issues.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Brambly and tart, with a peppery, leathery nose. It's zesty, lightly concentrated Garnacha with zingy, mouth-burning raspberry and plum flavors. A sharp, reticent wine in every way. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",Spain,Garnacha
"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An herbal and brambly roughneck with forced aromas, lots of leather, and ultimately cranberry and other tart red-fruit flavors. Not much body, and thus it's short and piquant.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An elegant and well-made Albariño with lemon chiffon, pear and green apple aromas. The palate is just right in feel, depth and minerality, with apple, pear, honeydew and hidden spice flavors. Clean, teetering on lush and delicious as it finishes. Drink this pretty wine as soon as possible.",Spain,Albariño
"This smells like plastic and milk chocolate at first, then with airing it begins to take on its classically Rioja character. It feels fresh and zesty, with a medium body and red fruit flavors that are spicy, lightly herbal and generic. A mid-level wine in every way.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Medicinal cherry and plum scents come with a grassy, minty persistence. This feels tannic and syrupy, with some heft, accompanying sweet black-fruit flavors that are green and herbal at the core. It finishes chunky, with a minty aftertaste.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This is flat and lemony on the nose, with a hint of asparagus. It feels zesty and tastes of tart lemon-lime and green bean. Tangy but not edgy or razor-like on the finish. This is a classic cool-climate white with citrus and green elements running the show.",Spain,White Blend
"Dry on the nose, this has light red-fruit aromas that are offset by spice and vanilla notes. It feels snappy and raw, with tart citrus, plum and tomato flavors. Crisp, quiet and vapid on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This smells rubbery and a bit gamy, with meaty berry aromas. Tannic, with gaps in the mouthfeel, it has flavors of prune and herb, which are not excessively sweet or raisiny. The finish is dry, tannic and steady.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A standard raspberry aroma introduces this wine, which feels short on substance but reasonable, with jammy, medicinal flavors of raspberry and strawberry. It is sweet, mild and candied on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A tiny bit earthy and peppery, with solid berry fruit aromas. The palate is sappy and medium-weight, with red-fruit flavors dominated by raspberry. Shows a touch of mocha/chocolate on a dry, basic finish. Imported by Bourgeois Family Selections.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Definitely sweet, syrupy and raisiny. Torres has made a chunky, plodding wine with saturated berry and plum flavors but hardly any of the mineral, schist, zest and excitement the Priorat is renowned for. Deep, dark and dense for sure, but ultimately flabby and mediocre. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stretched on the nose, with reedy, wiry, candied red-fruit aromas. Quite tannic and a bit syrupy in the mouth, with ultrasweet berry flavors and then a scratchy, forward finish. Has its merits but seems out of place and pushy for Spain. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A decent old-school throwback, with dried spice, pepper and slight red-fruit aromas followed by a light-bodied palate of plum and raspberry. While it's mostly lean, there is the smallest note of caramel and toffee to the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A fleshy, simple wine with gumball aromas. The palate is chubby but not all that structured, with plump but basic berry and plum flavors. The finish shows some blackberry but not much else. Good and generally clean, but rudimentary. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Starts out pretty good and fruity, but becomes more challenged with time. There's a truckload of early raspberry fruit, but it turns more sharp and piercing the more time it sits. Lengthy and potent, but not elevated.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sweet and syrupy, with molasses on the nose. On one hand it's rich, ripe and flavorful, but also cooked, lumpy and heavy. It's almost like a sweet red; sappy and made to be drunk soon.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is as crisp and dry as a whispy reed, with a mild grassy note on the nose. It feels fresh and focused, with lime, peach and apple flavors. Fruity, fresh and easy to like from start to finish, this is what a Best Buy should be.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is a little wayward and funky on the nose, with a lightly pickled aroma. It's a forward Cava with a yeasty, creamy feel. Its acidity and proper bubbles set up flavors of pastry, powdered sugar and sweet apple. The finish is quick, ending with a white-pepper flavor.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of root beer, autumn leaves, leather and raisins indicate ripeness more than heavyness. It shows lots of life and kick on the palate, where the flavors run toasty and rooty, with a hint of brown sugar. Peppy acidity keeps it lively and traditional through the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard and capped on the nose, this has hints of cement, cheesy oak, minty fruit and tobacco. Savory and roasted on the palate, with a blend of Marsala and mushroom as well as saline, baked berry and ham notes. The finish is savory in a natural, nongreen way.",Spain,Red Blend
"Lemon, lime, apple and nectarine aromas are regular and clean. It feels good, citrusy and just round enough, with passion fruit, grapefruit and orange flavors. Tasty and fresh, this works well as a refresher.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A smooth and coaxing Sherry with almond and dried fruit aromas that lead perfectly to toffee and almond flavors. There's more dryness than fruit here, with peanut brittle accents and then a long, smoky finish that doesn't lose focus. Graceful Oloroso, with a nice individual character.",Spain,Sherry
"This is nothing more than a few barrels of wine bottled by Hughes, a so-called “global vintner.” And like its Lot 128 brother, it is really good juice. Inky and floral, with blueberry and wild raspberry flavors. It's smooth, fresh, bold and finishes with mint and chocolate. Shows the positives of Campo de Borja's Garnacha.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast. The wine is ripe and balanced, with hickory flavors adding a barbecued angle to the steady palate. Firm, structured and tasting of clove and woodspice on the finish. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ribera is not prime rosé country, and this wine doesn't much help the cause. Cherry cough drop aromas are about all you're going to get, while the palate is jumpy and sour, with apple skin and grapefruit flavors. Too much like a sucking candy.",Spain,Rosé
"Rooty on the nose, with green herb, tea and raspberry aromas. Patience and airing only brings it to the acceptable level, which means the wine's reasonably good prune and dark-fruit flavors are scuttled by a disjointed, overly acidic mouthfeel.",Spain,Red Blend
"There's something not right about the way this winery is fermenting its Cavas because both this and Oriol Rossell's regular brut are excessively foamy. As a result, this gran reserva's apple and spice aromas and flavors are rendered moot by the gaseous explosion that occurs when liquid hits palate.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is mucky and sweet. Its best foot is not put forward via the compost-like nose, and from then on there's little more than prune, leather and a sticky mouthfeel.",Spain,Garnacha
"Eight grapes comprise this weird, peanutty, almost dirty red blend. The nose is like a salad of bitter greens and peanut vinaigrette, and the palate shows big fruit, bigger tannins and then a finish of asparagus and green beans. Imported by USA Wines Inc.",Spain,Red Blend
"Reasonably clean, simple and steady on the bouquet, this is subsequently chunky and fairly full in the mouth, with grassy red-fruit flavors that end with tannic clamp. Perfectly drinkable for a large-production wine (38,000 cases).",Spain,Garnacha
"This is wide and sweet on the bouquet, with pear and cider aromas. It feels thick and a bit grabby, with basic apple flavor and not much more. Long on the finish, it has a decent feel if you don't mind some excess foam.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Earthy, rubbery aromas accompany rustic notes of stalk and leather. This feels astringent and grabby, with green berry and mint flavors. It finishes with size and power but not much agility.",Spain,Garnacha
"Citrus and yeast aromas form the nose on this wine, which feels forward and bubbly, with some sizzle to the palate. Cherry, plum and nectarine flavors are good, and it finishes with vitality. This is sweet and flavorful stuff.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Asphalt, leather and paint aromas are present on the scratchy bouquet. It feels clacky, with pushy acidity and flavors of tomato, saline, herb plum and raspberry. It's lively, with a bite to the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The nose is leathery and mulchy, with earthy berry aromas. It feels raw and choppy, with stalky, leathery, burnt flavors, plus pinches of green and mint. Ultimately it doesn't have much berry power or clarity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells rubbery and gritty, with notes of gas and leather. It feels acidic and drawing but healthy, with earthy red-berry flavors. Dry and peppy, there's still not a lot of style or character to the wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This smells rubbery, like a tire, before the berry and plum aromas settle in—although it remains a bit like pastic in scent. It feels tight and balanced, with acidity pushing flavors of plum, strawberry and mineral. This is crisp, juicy and more acidic than weighty on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is dense and saturated, with crushed blackberry and plum aromas that turn more jammy and granular as the wine breathes. It's extracted and heavy on the palate, with candied black plum and berry flavors that lose steam on the finish. This could be too heavy for fans of leaner-bodied wines.",Spain,Red Blend
"A slightly murky and chemical-smelling wine with a nose of rubber band, beets, red fruits and licorice. It's sweet and roasted in the mouth, with molasses and raisin flavors. Hard tannins and a gritty finish make it a tough run. The winery is trying to make something good and elevated, but the vintage (hot) didn't comply.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"Nobody ever said Yecla in southern Spain is Sauvignon Blanc country, but here is proof that the grape does exist there. The wine is generally clean and floral, with tart apple and citrus flavors heading straight to a pithy, driving, slightly bitter finish. Shows good verve but comes up a little empty. Imported by Marquee Artisan Wines.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"The nose is heavy and dosed with burnt rubber and leather, but the palate fares better, with cherry and raspberry flavors and a pretty clean and clear mouthfeel. A simple but sound wine with a slight resiny green character but mostly it shows decent red fruit with mild sweetness. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Garnacha
"Early match-stick aromas fade and give way to scents of white fruits and wisteria flower. The plump palate offers papaya, peach and nectarine flavors, while the finish dries out quickly, leaving a slight pithy bitterness. A little bland but still pretty good. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Spain,White Blend
"Rather oily and hard on the nose, with dried cheese, brett, mint and black fruit. The palate is rich and extremely forward, and the flavors are sweet but not that substantive or complex. Chocolate and mocha on the finish are about as much carry-through as you get.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rather baked and heavy, with chunky black fruit and chocolate on the nose. First in line on the palate is raisin and prune, while in back of that there's vanilla, dill and brown sugar. With grating tannins and excess weight, this one has balance issues while still offering some good looks at Ribera del Duero. Imported by Admiral Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A fuller, more minty and deep Garnacha than Hughes' Lot 129. This has standup, standout aromas followed by deep berry fruit flavors. It has plenty of body but keeps its balance, and the finish is thick and strong. A little rugged but really good by regional standards.",Spain,Garnacha
"A touch horsey at first, but with time it settles on saddle leather and earthy fruit. The palate is chunky and beefy, with some funk, chocolate and herbal black fruit. Not super spunky and lively, but dense as a brick and interesting. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ripe and attractive, with deep red fruit aromas. The palate is intense and thorough, with solid tannins supporting ripe, natural flavors of baked berries, particularly blackberry and dark plum. Subtle and smooth on the finish, with length. The blend is 50% Garnacha and 25% each Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"A potent, concentrated sort of wine with minerally, crusty aromas, smoked meat and black fruit. The palate is deep and ripe, with pure, tasty, sweet flavors of mildly baked blackberry. Generous late, with mocha and toast on the finish. Best now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bold, dark and handsome, albeit a touch herbal and earthy on the nose. The palate is thick and statuesque, with herbal, rooty berry fruit, a spot of raisin, and cracked black pepper. Chewy, deep and ultimately dry on the finish. Drinkable now; best in another couple of years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A loud, fiery nose indicates that this wine has a lot in store. Aromas of brick dust, earth, tobacco and red pepper flake set up a choppy, tannic, lively palate with a full dosage of cherry, plum, spice and toast flavors. Roasted on the finish but still fresh. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A barrel-aged surprise. The nose is round and toasty but not overwooded. The palate is balanced and elegant, with full, round, integrated flavors of dry apple, cream and spice. Has the right texture to be considered elevated and classy; 70% Treixadura with five other white grapes.",Spain,White Blend
"This smells charred and burnt, with a leaf aroma following. It ranges from fresh to grating, with roasted tomato, plum, compost and earth flavors. Saucy and roasted on the finish, this is a blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet and Syrah.",Spain,Red Blend
". Its mouthfeel smacks hard with acidity, leaving a crisp expression of strawberry, raspberry and herb flavors. It turns warm, lactic and chocolaty on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Aromas of white gum drop and funky yeast set up a slightly cloying palate, with a candied flavor of pear. It transitions to notes of banana, mango and powdered sugar on the finish. A blend of Malvasia and Viura.",Spain,White Blend
"Gaseous and rubbery on the nose, this is overpowered by a tire aroma and heavily reduced berry scents. It feels thick and ultrajammy, with overwhelming berry flavors in front of a heavy, hot finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Rubbery and fiery on the nose, this wine is then chunky, chewy and thick in the mouth. It tastes sweet, like berry syrup, but also a touch grassy and herbal. It feels full in weight and tastes slightly warm on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Super pungent and forceful, with extreme aromas of grapefruit, nettle and sweat. Aggressive and spritzy feeling, with tangy lemon-lime flavors accented by a dose of sweeter tangerine. Citric at all points. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Sauvignon
"Peppery and lightly herbal on the nose, with a whiff of dry red fruits. The palate is pretty snappy and angular, however, the red-fruit flavors mixed with pepper and spice ring true. Finishes dry without a whole lot of carry. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Smells a little fiery, although you do get decent cherry and raspberry from the nose. Solid enough in the mouth, with ripe plum and black cherry flavors in front of a candied, vanilla-ladened finish. Pretty good, with commercially viable sweetness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A hint of burnt leaves and compost draws down the bouquet, but overall this is a decent $9 wine. It's crisp, acidic and a little stemmy, but amid the leanness it also has an appealing fresh quality that emphasizes red fruit, pepper and snap.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Given the price, this wine is more than acceptable and may even be pleasing for those not seeking greatness. It is punchy and grapey, with a bit of dried cheese on the nose along with berry and plum. It's sizable, loud, concentrated and tastes pretty good. Among $7 wines, it's recommended.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of berry fruits, coconut and leather add up well, but the wine falls off in the mouth, where it's sweet, gummy and jacked up. Very tannic and compact in terms of feel, with a hard finish anchored by serious tannins. Fruity and forward but lacking balance. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Big and heavy, with forceful aromas of shoe polish, tar and balsam wood. It's saturated and dense in the mouth, but the cherry and blackberry flavors are tart and underdeveloped. And the finish falls off fast. Imported by Baron Francois Ltd.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Char-accented wild berry and plum aromas go straight into a bright, edgy palate of cherry and plum, and overall this is a simple, slightly candied Garnacha that has some sizzle and burn to it. Racy and the slightest bit green at its core.",Spain,Garnacha
"A heavy aromatic dose of funk, bramble and rubber is what greets you, and that reduced awkwardness never leaves the wine. Size and in-your-face leather and animal notes are dominant traits, and only below that do you find blackberry, plum and any mellowness. A good mouthfeel is the wine's saving grace. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"This has an earthy nose, but airing helps this Monastrell-Syrah blend move beyond the leathery, warm notes. It feels full yet balanced, with roasted, savory flavors of stewed plum and grilled meat. It's warm, with a dose of molasses on the finish.",Spain,Monastrell-Syrah
"An easygoing but nicely made Rioja that delivers purity, good fruit, body and feel. The nose is all cherry and berry, and it's a clear step up from your everyday red wine. The palate is medium bodied, with tasty, spicy flavors of cherry and raspberry. Lasting on the finish, with proper texture throughout.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Generic red fruit and milk chocolate aromas precede a tangy palate with a fairly high acid-to-body ratio. This tastes of tart red plum, with a hint of chocolate; it's short, crisp and quaffable. Novo Imports and Aidil Wines & Liquors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is mulchy on the nose, with a compost aroma muddling up the red-fruit component. It feels lean and scouring, with cranberry, tart raspberry and vanilla flavors. The finish is fragmented and stalky.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells gaseous, with tutti-frutti notes. It feels acidic and angular, with a narrow scope of red fruit flavors. It's a touch bitter on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A dusty cherry aroma turns harsh with airing, setting up a tight, acidic palate that's marked by tart raspberry and plum flavors. Scouring, spicy and peppery on the finish, this amounts to a tight, hard and basic Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Dry berry, leather and spice aromas lead to a juicy, high-acid palate, with red cherry, tart plum and pepper accents. It remains zesty, clean, simple and sharp on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flat, jammy and pasty on the nose, this wine has mildly lactic, slightly green flavors of berry and cherry. It loses its fruit on the back palate and finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"An oily popcorn aroma is neither fresh nor lively. The palate is wide and mouthfilling, with notes of bitter almond and creamy citrus. It's viscous on the finish, but there's not much flavor or character.",Spain,White Blend
"While it's golden in color, the wine isn't oaky or over the hill. Scents of buttercup, honeysuckle, baked apple and melon lead to a round, almost Burgundian-like mouthfeel. The flavors of melon, apple and peach are solid, and the finish is naturally creamy from the 50% Gewürztraminer in the blend—Macabeo comprises the other 50%.",Spain,Macabeo-Gewürztraminer
"Tobacco, brown sugar, dried fruit and vanilla aromas work the bouquet, which is very nice. In the mouth, however, it's acidic, almost to the point of being citrusy. Flavors of earthy sour plum and raspberry are propped up by lasting acids, while the palate teeters on lemony and shear. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The nectarine and mild vanilla aromas are subdued yet solid. On the palate, it's all about stone fruit flavors, such as peach and nectarine, with apple and cider notes on the balanced and healthy finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Freixenet's signature Cava is consistent and pure as usual, with aromas of white fruit and white pepper and an overall freshness on the nose. It feels crisp and focused, with a foamy palate that brings apple, lime, peach and spice flavors. The finish is smooth.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The wine's tan-gold color tells you that it's fading, the aromas of canned pineapple are not particularly fresh, and the finish is fleshy and fat. Imported by Alconde Vineyards, LLC.",Spain,Verdejo
"Best early and then it shows its lesser pedigree later on. Early aromas of ripe berry fruit aren't bad before they shift to measurably jumpy and edgy. There's black cherry candy flavors and then snap, crackle and pop on the tongue. Good for the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Seems sort of waxy and baked, with mildly acrid aromas of burnt corn leading the way. The palate has an o.k. feel but the flavors are rather bitter and burnt, and the fruit isn't pointed or expressive. May already be past its prime. Imported by Winery Exchange.",Spain,Verdejo
"Opens with dried red fruit and cinnamon aromas, but after that the mouth is creamy and grabby, with bland fruit and then a wave of vanilla cream and milk chocolate on the finish. A sticky wine that doesn't fully pass the balance test.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Not bad on the nose, where strawberry and cream aromas are doused a bit by a burnt-field smell. In the mouth, it's snappy and elastic, with tart flavors of apple, underripe nectarine and grapefruit. Finishes lean and crisp, without much personality. Imported by Testa Wines Of The World.",Spain,Rosé
"Pleasant but very basic, with a nose of dry cherry and a palate that's crisp, lean and features flavors of tart plum and cherry. A decidedly crisp and lean style of Rioja, with no richness to speak of save for a hint of butter on the finish. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Starts out on shaky ground with coconut and chemical aromas. In the mouth, it hits very hard with cola, raisin and cherry flavors. Falls flat and empty on the finish, and as a whole it seems overdone. Seems like a novelty, and at $36 it fails to impress.",Spain,Petite Verdot
"Roll out the barrel, or the staves, or the oak dust, or whatever it is that gives this modest Chardonnay such an overpowering wood element. Amid all the toast and burnt popcorn there's honey, butter, baked white fruits and pretty good core acidity. Imported by JNJ International Inc.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Stemmy and rough out of the blocks, with aromas of rubber and strawberry. Seems grabby in the mouth due to rather rough tannins and high acidity, and overall the wine seems forced but lacking in the essentials. Quite expensive given the result. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With tobacco, licorice, herbs, bell pepper and carob, there's a bit of everything to this Navarran Cabernet. The palate is thick and chewy, but it's also sticky and very tannic. Flavors run toward vegetal and green, with clove, burnt sugar and roasted fruit. Heat and molasses work the finish of this beefy beast that lacks clarity.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"When in doubt, you can always trust Dry Sack. As always, this is a powerful, rich Sherry with burnt sugar and heavily toasted coffee and caramel flavors. It's no softie courtesy of heat and acidity, and at all points it mixes its sweet side with tough, roasted intensity. Great for cigar smokers.",Spain,Sherry
"Excellent Ribera crianza here. It has a smooth, appealing bouquet of candied berry fruit, which is followed by a rich palate of cassis, black cherry, prune, chocolate and coffee. For the price point this is right on the money; it's ripe but also really good and ready to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dry, spicy and earthy on the nose, with Boston baked bean aromas and candied berry fruit notes. The palate has good spunk and life to it, while the flavors of berry fruit are controlled and modest but heavily spiced. Finishes with cinnamon, nutmeg and fruit cake notes along with a final wave of balancing acidity. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This wine smells fermented, like Tequila. Linear, acidic and lemony on the palate, it has tart apple and pineapple flavors. A citrus note carries the finish to a modest end point. Although it's good enough, it's neither inspired nor inspiring. Tasted twice.",Spain,Macabeo
"Scratchy berry and rubber aromas roll into a grabby, aggressive palate, with a burnt note and resiny oak overshadowing a berry flavor. The finish is rubbery and chunky.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Crisp plum and raspberry aromas set up a snappy, tight palate with green flavors of plum, raspberry and herb. It tastes vegetal on the finish, with cutting acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Plastic and lemon aromas are neither exciting nor inviting. This feels flat and tastes bland and jammy, with mossy berry aromas.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells bullish and chunky, with a lively, acid-driven palate that boasts cherry, dark plum and cocoa flavors. It feels drawing and full of vitality, so serve this with food or allow it to breathe.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells savory and roasted, like hickory, before turning earthy and stalky as it airs out. But overall it's firm on the palate, with roasted, oak-influenced flavors of savory berry and saline. Full on the finish, with healthy but not overly aggressive tannic bite.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A mixture of tomato, jammy red fruit, alcohol and grit gives this four-grape, Garnacha-led blend a tough path to hoe. In the mouth, the fruit is shrill as it settles on raspberry and cherry, while the feel and length are short. Hits the palate then it's gone in a flash.",Spain,Red Blend
"With basic pear, green melon and other sweet aromas, the nose is controlled. But the palate on this white Garnacha is dry and soda-like, with seltzer-like flavors touched up by citrus. Decent but bland. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Garnacha
"Standard berry along with warm, earthy aromas give it some size, and the palate shows medium-bodied raspberry and strawberry flavors. There's a forward, semiracy feel to it, but in the end there isn't a whole lot of finish, flavor or finesse.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Modest fruit aromas and a touch earthy and burnt smelling, with lively, somewhat tart raspberry and plum flavors. A bit of vanilla and caramel comes on late, and overall this ranks as a standard, lean-style Rioja. Imported by Admiral Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rhubarb and brambly black cherry aromas set up sweet, candied, fairly forced red-berry flavors that have a green element and a slightly cloying feel. The palate has some weight and creaminess to it, but also the sugary feel you get when eating cotton candy.",Spain,Garnacha
"Neutral smelling, with a hint of pool water to the nose. The palate delivers a strange combination of mustard and white grapefruit, and the finish is pithy to the extreme and mildly bitter. The blend is the uncommon mix of Sauvignon Blanc and Macabeo (Viura). Imported by Spanish Vines, Inc.",Spain,White Blend
"Aromas of strawberry, cassis and mocha are brought down a notch by vegetal notes, while the palate is heavier than the winery's straight-ahead Tempranillo. Flavors of plum and boysenberry are chunky and quick to fade, and green notes reappear on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Same score as the prior vintage, and pretty much the same tart wine. It's red in color, sweet and candied on the nose, and awkward in general. And then it's citric and sour in the mouth, with flavors of pink grapefruit. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Seems like the hot sun of central Spain got to this three-grape blend because it's undeniably sweet and baked. The aromas are pure raisin, while the palate is drawn down and syrupy. Too thick and sweet for its own good.",Spain,Red Blend
"Starts with pine, saline and berry candy aromas and it settles on sweet and jumpy. Juicy as can be and very lively, but also short, choppy, sweet and with a bubble gum character.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Fresh, dry and elevated by any conventional cava standards. The nose breathes lime, green apple and spice notes, while the palate is crisp, peppery and lightly toasted. Apple and controlled citrus are the fruit components, and then a light yeasty character arises on the finish. A pretty, feminine brut nature to drink now and over the next few years.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fleshy and rich, with a clear reflection of barrel fermentation on the nose, palate and finish. This is plump Verdejo with match stick and toasty vanilla on the bouquet. It's full, round and toasted in the mouth, with spiced apple and vanilla flavors. Oaky and mature; drink this Spanish ode to Burgundy now.",Spain,Verdejo
"This is fairly mulchy on the nose, with an earthy prune aroma. It feels grabby and lean, with cranberry fruit flavor, bitterness and an herb accents. The finish stays murky, tart and mildly green.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This smells of funk, yeast and cured meat. Tangy and acidic in the mouth, it has peach, citrus and ham flavors, finishing a bit mealy.",Spain,Viura
"Harsh and sweaty, with a mouthfeel that's fleshy and oily, this has bitter white-fruit flavors that finish stalky. It has a mealy, green quality that previous vintages lacked. Tasted twice with mostly similar results.",Spain,Verdejo
"Damp and mossy on the nose, this has a leafy berry aroma that lacks brightness. It feels narrow and sharp, with limited flavors of red fruit. The finish is tart and empty.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This smells raw and minty, with an artificial candy note. It feels lean, with a green, weedy flavor of red fruit. It shows heat and scour on the finish. This is a blend of equal parts Tempranillo and Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Generic white-fruit aromas feature apple and melon. It feels sharp as a razor, with citric acidity pushing lemon and sour peach flavors, finishing tart.",Spain,Viura
"Black-fruit aromas are forceful, toasty and gritty. It feels solid, fruity and full bodied, with black fruit flavors that come across ripe and generous. It's oaky but not overly so.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Immediately this wine plays soft and raisiny. The nose has a stout molasses component, and the palate is sweet and vanilla-infused. A sticky strawberry flavor is sweetened up by coconut and vanilla on the finish. Not well balanced. Imported by Quintessential Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark fruit aromas come with a grainy, almost chemical side, while the palate feels gritty as it pushes licorice and black cherry flavors. Rubbery and without much finish. Imported by American Northwest Distributors Inc.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Thin and saline on the nose, with a chemical-chlorine smell. The palate is fairly sour and raw, with tough tannins and a killer grip. As a whole, the mid-level flavors don't taste like much, and the finish is clamp-down tight.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
Decent aromas but overly acidic and astringent. The cherry flavor is so sour that any vanilla or oak that may come on late can't save the day. Imported by Baron Francois Ltd.,Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lacquer and apple cider aromas lead to a sticky, sweet palate. There's a citric edge to it but mostly it's just sweet and tastes like orange slices and jelly beans. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Red licorice candy on the nose is the only sign of life. Otherwise it's just sour and dried-out, with flavors of citrus and plum skins. Past its prime.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Not much good to say here. Burnt, weak aromas include raspberry, while the acidic palate tastes of cherry and plum skins. Lean and tart-sour all the way.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Has some serious cleanliness issues on the nose, and while it's not entirely unpalatable, it does struggle to make many positive statements. Tastes flat, mealy and bitter, and there's even some burn to it. Imported by Scoperta Importing Co. Inc.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Opens with rooty, mature aromas of tobacco, baked berry and raisin, while the palate is full and roasted, with sweet baked-plum and brown sugar flavors. Mature and ready to go, with head-to-toe sweetness and molasses accents. Not a hard, tannic wine. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Starts out with gentle matchstick aromas, but with time it's all about white fruits, green herbs and apple. The palate has a firm, standard, high-quality mouthfeel along with tart apple, white peach and pineapple flavors. The finish is pure lime and snap, while the refreshment quotient runs long and strong.",Spain,Albariño
"Stalky aromas of burnt hay and rhubarb are not welcoming. This feels edgy and tastes horsey, green and minty. The finish is grassy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Briary red-fruit aromas are forward and attractive. Feels juicy, with good acidic cut and ample body. Flavors of dark plum and berry come with hints of crushed herbs and dry spices. Finishes bold, with peppery spice and a pinch of heat.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Plum and berry aromas get a strong assist from notes of mint and licorice on the nose. Lively and packed on the palate, it's acidic and lean, even more so as it unwinds and breathes. Flavors of baked red plum and mocha are followed by a balsamic-tasting finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"An oaky style of Priorat, this smells of hickory and campfire, with bacon, plum and cherry notes. Solid but narrow in the mouth, with berry and cherry flavors mixed with hard spice and chocolate notes. It has just enough acidity to stay fresh, turning slightly fiery on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Green and hard, with carob and ashtray aromas. The palate is simple and narrow, with sour red-fruit flavors that come to a slightly bitter ending. A defining combination of tartness and bubble gum dust isn't impressive.",Spain,Red Blend
"Reasonably fresh on the nose, but ultranarrow and tart in the mouth. In fact, it's borderline sour in the way it presents such linear red fruit. Tight as a drum and sheering. Can't say this is what we want from La Mancha.",Spain,Shiraz
"Herbal, green and grassy, with less than fresh fruit character. The palate has a weedy taste, while the finish is green and peppery. Edgy mouthfeel; barely acceptable red wine for the second straight vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A dry, oily, piquant Oloroso that's more peanutty than almondy. The palate is racy due to no shortage of acidity, and the flavor profile is led by a salty, briney almond and leather character. Sheer and serious, with not a sugar cube in sight.",Spain,Palomino
"A bit heavy and raisiny, but with that said there's no denying the wine's richness and ripeness. Lush and dense in the mouth, with cocoa, roasted fruit and a mild syrupy lean to the flavor profile. Sweet but a little short on the finish, and condensed. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Roasted plum and raspberry aromas offer accents of vanilla, dill and dry wood. The palate is big, a little soft and chubby in the middle, with savory, herbal black fruit flavors that are meaty and deep. Finishes earthy, herbal and with integrity. This is Monastrell that's ready to go.",Spain,Red Blend
"Brawny but lovely, with monster black fruit, balsam wood, tobacco and cola nut aromas. The palate is ultra rich and modern in style, with deep, brandied flavors of cola, black cherry and spice. Driven, modern and properly tannic, with a fair amount of mocha and creaminess on the finish. Drink from late 2010 thru 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cheers to one of Rioja's most basic yet consistent white wines. Minerally and crystalline on the nose, with dusty apple, melon and stony aromas, this Viura is fresh, dry and average in weight. It tastes of papaya and apple, finishing dry and clean.",Spain,Viura
"Creamsicle aromas have a dry tea note, and overall this tastes like Pinot Noir. It feels foamy and soft, with flavors of tea leaf, orange and cherry. The finish is rooty tasting and mild.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Standard berry aromas show touches of raisin and earth, but not too much of either. It feels fresh, crisp and alert, with cherry tomato, berry fruit, tobacco and vanilla flavors. This feels healthy but not real deep or complex on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Brambly red-fruit aromas mix with notes of sweet milk chocolate and dust. It feels crisp, tight and fresh, with raspberry and lightly herbal plum flavors. This finishes taut and fruity. A blend of 75% Garnacha and 25% Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark plum and berry aromas come with a touch of rubber. It feels bright, healthy and juicy, with good body and earthy berry and dark plum flavors. While it's not complicated, it's accurate and flavorful.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy and crusty at first, with smoked meat, black fruit and dryness to the nose. The palate is well formed and proper, with dry raspberry and mild chocolate flavors. Finishes peppery and solid, with the slightest herbal note. Very nice wine to drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A super sweet, potent brew that takes no prisoners as it hits with powerful toffee, caramel and alcohol aromas. Good in the mouth because it's not gritty, but very sweet on the palate, with honey, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors. If sweet is your thing, then add a point or two to our score.",Spain,Sherry
"Having really liked this wine a couple of years ago, this vintage seems comparatively fierce and aggressive, which isn't to say it isn't hugely flavorful and aromatic. On the down side, it's residue-heavy and tannic, with full extraction and tannic berry fruit. Tough as nails; maybe it just needs a couple of years to settle.",Spain,Mencía
"Opens with rich aromas of raisin, licorice, black plum and molasses that put it on the cusp of overripe. The palate is rich and gritty, with deep berry and molasses flavors. Generous for sure, but also slightly baked and sweet. Tastes like a warm-climate, warm-vintage wine. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Raspberry and plum aromas carry a mild floral, perfumed accent, while the palate is medium in weight, with good flow due to lively acidity. Flavors of red fruits are equalized by oaky vanilla and dry herbs, while the finish is lengthy and snappy due to aforementioned core acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Creamy and minty on the nose, with dark berry aromas that veer toward raisiny. The palate is generous, full, reduced and narrow, with raisin, blackberry and heavy spice flavors. An old-vines style of Monastrell that lumbers across the finish line with full ripeness and sweetness. Drink now.",Spain,Monastrell
"Deep and dark as night, with a lake's worth of cassis and black fruit aromas. There is no interference here; just pure, big-boned, modern-style Tempranillo flavors of currants, blackberry and soft, cuddly oak. Finishes with cream and coconut, but length and power as well. Hold until late 2010 and drink through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Huge wine with sweetness and smooth qualities from head to toe. Aromas of mint leaf, pastry and sweet black fruits are magnetic, while the lush, layered palate is complete and packed with berry fruit, toast, fudge and tobacco flavors. Layered and deep on the finish, with cola, herbs and licorice notes. Beautiful wine. Drinkable now and good through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Apple, mineral and light yeast notes define the bouquet. It feels snappy and zesty, with a mix of pickled citrus, fresh sauerkraut and lemon flavors. This is cleansing and tangy on the tail end, with a briny finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Here's a floral-smelling, light-style mix of Moscatel and Macabeo that will function best as a quaffing wine. It smells of acacia and orange blossom, showing modest weight and acidity, with citrus and tropical fruit flavors. The finish is short and light.",Spain,White Blend
"Snappy cherry and berry aromas have the slightest accent of mint and grass. It feels fresh, forward and tight, with plum and spicy berry flavors. The finish remains fruity and firm.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Radiator dust, baked apple and other familiar, semirich aromas grace the nose on this more elevated Cava. In the mouth, there's chunkiness, weight and integrity along with a flavor profile that hints at vinegar but settles on cidery apple and kumquat. Nicely done and different from the mass wines Freixenet is known for.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Solid if a bit soupy and tomato-driven on the nose. In the mouth, there's a nice offset between herbal, red fruit characteristics, tobacco and black fruit. Overall, it's a gritty, tight, honest Ribera wine with a long, powerful finish. Just ripe enough, with indviduality and identity. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Oddly, this is preferable to El Nido's $140 Cab-heavy fruit bomb. Maybe that's because Monastrell is the go-to grape in Jumilla, and this is 70% Monastrell and only 30% Cab compared to the opposite with El Nido. All that said, this wine is ripe, approachable and dark, with excellent balance and a fudgy, warm finish of fruitcake and blackberry. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"Starts with the scent of beef on the grill, and then folds in black fruit and fine aged cheese. The palate is as rich and smooth as a silk throw, while flavors of berry, cassis, herbs and coffee cover the bases. Mildly balsamic on the finish, yet not complicated, demanding or overly complex. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The nose is defined by white fruit aromas, while the palate is a bit flat in feel but lively enough. It tastes of papaya and peach, with a touch of green herb.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Plum and berry aromas are a touch rubbery at first, but they air out well. It feels medium bodied and clean, with traditional Rioja flavors of dry oak, dill, tobacco, plum and cherry. The finish is mild and fresh.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Light, powdery, sweet and citrusy on the nose, this becomes fairly creamy on the palate. It's aggressively sweet tasting but not cloying, with orange and mango fruit and a finish stocked with enlivening acidity.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A bit sweet and raisiny on the nose, but also dense and powerful. The palate runs rough and tannic, but there's enough richness and extract to allow for that. Flavors of cassis and raspberry are dark but snappy, while the finish has raisiny notes but also some edge. This one may improve with time; drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts out a bit sweaty and leathery, but soon it turns more smoky. As a whole it's more bulky and barnyardy than most PX wines, with sweet prune and raisin flavors that seem a bit generic. Thick on the finish, with a gooey sweetness throughout.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Dusty, creamy, powdered sugar aromas are nice and easygoing, while the palate has balance and a mouthfeel that caresses solid apple, citrus and peach flavors. Crisp on the finish, with a decent amount of elegance for a $15 wine. Hard to go wrong with this bubbly.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Another stellar El Puntido, this time with excellent concentration and full-load aromas of black fruit, leather, fine dried cheese and cola. The palate is tight, properly stretched and racy, with bursting black raspberry and cassis flavors. Coconut and resin on the finish is the first and only glaring announcement of oak. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Just right on the nose, with a smoky, attractive set of deep berry aromas. The palate is pure and composed, with a pure, tasty mix of berry fruit, cocoa and mild oak. Smooth, long and creamy on the finish, and delicious overall. Best wine to date from Emina. Drink now into 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Protos is a flagship Ribera del Duero property and its wines have been on the rise lately. This is ripe and spicy, with black fruit and then a twitch of prune and moss on the nose. It's racy, pure, forward and stout, with a mix of red and black fruit flavors. Warm and integrated on the finish. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells nice and rooty, and also a bit like strawberry jam. It feels steely, zesty, juicy and almost too acidic, with blazing red plum and pie cherry flavors that are offset by integrated, spicy oak. It's dry and tangy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Plum and raspberry aromas turn herbal with airing. Feels good and plump, with restrained tannins. Tastes like roasted red berries, dry oak and leather mixed with leafy herbs. Good but loses some clarity as it breathes.",Spain,Mencía
"Dense and spicy on the nose, with tobacco, baked fruit aromas and dry, woody notes. It's a fairly rich, slick and generous Rioja with lightly baked berry fruit flavors, spice cake accents and limited complexity. Solid on the finish, with additional spice notes. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A touch gritty and baked on the nose, and that ripe character persists throughout this semimodern Ribera wine. Along the route there's raisiny notes, baked plum flavors and oak-driven vanilla and spice. On the finish, vanilla is the lasting flavor. Solid and oaky, with some pushy coconut.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean and vibrant, with citrus blossom and apple aromas. The palate is a bit neutral in flavor but shows good cut and a cleansing feel along with tastes of spiced apple and white nectarine. Finishes clean and pure. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"A really nice, dark, modern style of Rioja from a good vintage. The nose is mildly foresty early on and robustly fruity, with stand-out black cherry and blackberry aromas. The palate is full, clean and balanced, with alert flavors of berry, spice, citrus peel and chocolate. Smooth as a glass table on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Green banana, apple and mineral aromas are nothing to get worked up over, but they are clean and inviting. This shows good acidity and lift on the palate, with pleasant flavors of citrus, nectarine and apple. It's crisp and clean on the finish.",Spain,Viura
"Aromas of minty oak, pastry and jammy raspberry set up a palate that's racy, juicy and somewhat raw feeling, with plum and raspberry flavors. It's woody on the finish, with a spice flavor.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"More flush and generous than the Vertus 100% Tempranillo, this blend of 50% Tempranillo and 50% Cabernet is bold but not heavy, with a medium body and clean, direct flavors of red berry and plum. It shows dashes of pepper and spice on the medium-long finish.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo
"After a somewhat gritty start, the bouquet settles on aromas of perfumed red fruit and lemony oak. It feels full, with nice acidic cut, offering flavors of leather, earth and savory baked fruit. Fairly long and mildly herbal on the finish.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Aromas and peach, apple and a spot of hay make for a nice, clean and familiar bouquet. It feels fresh and easy, with tangerine, nectarine and spiced apple flavors. Crisp, solid and quick on the finish, this is clean overall.",Spain,Macabeo-Chardonnay
"Apple and stone fruit aromas come with a mineral component and a stalky, hay note. It feels good and full, showing classic Cava flavors of stalky apple and nectarine. The finish is smooth and easygoing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"An oaky, modern-style wine with a staunch mocha and vanilla influence, but the fruit is ripe and rich enough to handle it. Spicy and grainy on the nose, with vanilla and resin seeping through. The palate remains woody but is full of berry flavors, while the omnipresent barrel influence carries onto the rich, ripe finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This wine costs a lot for what it's giving. The nose starts out hard and fruitless, and while the aromas come around, the wine always holds onto its corn and haystack character. Zippy acidity gives the mouth zest, and it also livens up papaya, banana and apricot flavors. Complex and different, but does it taste good enough to justify a $78 price tag?",Spain,White Blend
"Starts out stewy, with exotic spice aromas that are uncommon but not unpleasant. That unusual spicy character persists throughout, and the feel is chewy and meaty while the fruit veers toward stewed blackberry, nutmeg and anise. A different breed of cat but a good one nonetheless. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Full, heavy, chunky wine with a powerful bouquet of black fruit and chocolate. The palate is about as full and concentrated as they come, but there's good balance and aging potential along with cassis, blackberry and mild herbal shadings. Savory and strong as it is long on the finish. Drinkable now but better from 2011–2014.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is grassy and pungent up front, with citrus, nectarine and apple aromas. It feels crisp and tangy, with chalky grip and flavors of citrus and green apple. Snappy and long on the finish, this is a Sauvignon Blanc-styled Viura.",Spain,Viura
"Hard and capped on the nose, this has mixed aromas of plastic, sulfur and white fruit. It feels creamy and tropical, with flavors of mango, banana and honey, with some bitterness on the back palate and finish.",Spain,Moscatel
"This is flowery and open on the nose, but then it flattens out in the mouth, with mild cut and an easy bead. It tastes of soft apple and peach, while the finish fruity and satisfying.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A Barcelona-based brand with this Bierzo label that's good, with generic red-fruit aromas and cheesy smelling oak. Feels light, snappy and feminine, with spicy, resiny flavors along with tart raspberry and tomato. Ends abruptly.",Spain,Mencía
"Cherry is the prime fruit aroma, and overall the nose is rubbery and edgy. Feels squeeky and tannic, with plum and red berry flavors leading to a fresh but raw feeling and a peppery-tasting finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet smelling, with a touch of pastry. Focused, lean and nice in the mouth, showing dry apple and citrus peel flavors. Solid Cava that brings a modicum of leesy, pithy richness on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Jumps out of the chute with baked, earthy, funky aromas that are more savory and spicy than outright fruity. The palate has a good but limited mouthfeel, while the flavors of raspberry are spicy and saucy. Good in a subtle, earthy, nonfruity way.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark purple in color, with a jammy nose of berry fruit and coconut. The palate is concentrated, a little narrow and sharp in the center, with snappy, pointed cherry and berry flavors. Fruity but sheer wine, with dashes of nutmeg and cocoa powder on the finish.",Spain,Tinta Fina
"Comes across a bit baked, syrupy and sweet on the nose, with a hint of stalkiness and stem. The palate has a lush early feel, but further inspection unveils a hollow core. Flavors veer toward earthy raspberry, while the finish is chunky and properly reflects what came before it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Warm, earthy aromas of molasses, moss and baked fruit scream rich and big, and the palate matches that early announcement with cola, baked blackberry, coffee and syrupy flavors. Weighty and forceful, but not without style and a flash of elegance. Pure Toro; drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A serious, oak-influenced Godello with smooth aromas of baked apple, wood resin, vanilla, spice and green melon. The palate has weight and fine acidity, so it's tight despite delivering a blast of oaky flavor. Alongside that resiny taste, there's green banana and peach notes. Fresh but woody; should age well for at least another 18 months.",Spain,Godello
"A round, chewy wine with a nice mix of black fruit, vanilla, aged cheese and light balsam wood on the nose. The palate is big but doesn't bite back, and the flavors of creamy berry are broad and nice. A very solid wine with weight and heat; drink now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A clean, dry, green-fruited wine that's juicy, citric, tangy and features pure orange, lemon and lime aromas and flavors. It's more of a quaffer than anything complex, but with fish or salads it should be just right. The blend is 70% Treixadura with multiple other white grapes including Torrontés, Godello and Albariño.",Spain,White Blend
"This smells a bit stalky, leathery and warm at first, but airing brings it along. While it's never all that vivid on the nose, it does smell of baked berry and plum. It feels wide and neither tannic nor tough, with lightly herbal, rustic flavors of plum and berry.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean, dry and light on the nose, this has a smoky, leafy accent. While it's not superlively on the palate, it offers nice grapefruit, cherry and nectarine flavors, with a dry, smoky and tasty finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"At first the nose is high toned and jumpy, but with time it falls into a good place with a medicinal berry note at the fore. Solid, tannic and nervy, it has plum and noticeable young-oak flavors. This turns herbal tasting and choppy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Coconut and vanilla aromas ride front and center on the oaky nose, although berry fruit rises up with time. The palate is bulky and saturated, almost what you'd call thick, while the flavors lean toward roasted berry, plum and woodspice. Vanilla and additional wood accents work the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Round and generally attractive, with raisiny richness that emerges with airing. The palate is more snappy and acidic than the nose might suggest, with herbal raspberry flavors. That same acidity lifts the finish, and overall the wine is fresh, racy and not that complex.",Spain,Tempranillo
"From Viña Mayor, this French-oak-aged wine is composed and dry, with good plum and berry aromas that bring balanced oak as well. The palate sports proper weight and balance, solid berry and plum flavors, and a warm, minty finish. Not mind blowing but good for a weak vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy and sweet smelling, with intensity and a lot of ripeness. Throughout it teeters on the precipice of being overripe, but amid the chunky darkness and sweetness there's tasty berry, chocolate and spice. Finishes a bit pruney and raisiny, so get at it as soon as you can.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"An interesting, well-made wine with distinct barrel notes. There's woodspice, toast, vanilla and elegant white fruit on the nose, yet the palate maintains Verdejo's natural verve while offering flavors of cinnamon apple, spiced pear, banana and tropical fruit. Drier on the finish, with a nip of butterscotch.",Spain,Verdejo
"Full, earthy and ripe, but also delivering alot of clean fruit, size and balance. The palate has moderate to full tannic grip, which props up berry, vanilla, wood and mild herbal flavors. Long, solid and a little oaky late, with proper purity and a commitment to the near future. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An attractive, ripe wine that pushes up against raisiny but then draws back to focus on blackberry, licorice and other dark aromas and flavors. Very good weight and mouthfeel, with nice balance supporting ripe berry, cola and mild chocolate flavors. Finishes lush and warm. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This opens with lightly perfumed red-fruit aromas of raspberry and plum, with a bright palate that shows mostly red plum, raspberry and cherry flavors. This is a basic, clean wine comprised of 75% Garnacha and 25% Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Call this Toro Nuevo in the same vein as Beaujolais Nouveau—the grape juice becomes finished wine in just six weeks. Look for a jammy nose with licorice and blackberry aromas and a simple palate that pushes plum and berry flavors, with little structure or stuffing.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Aromas of hay and sweet grass are offset by notes of apple and melon. It feels healthy and easy, with white peach, nectarine and apple flavors. It's good and uncomplicated, with a touch of corn flavor on the finish.",Spain,Viura
"Slightly more leafy, herbal and burnt on the nose than ideal, but there's also tobacco, cherry and earth notes to keep it proper. The palate is smooth in feel, with good depth, while the flavor profile has a salty side as well as black cherry and molasses. Good wine with a few issues.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raisiny, sweet and baked, with plenty of oak coming on as it airs out. This vintage is somewhat syrupy and strained compared to prior years, with baked black fruit flavors. Seems a little reduced on the finish, but overall it's still good given this winery's strong track record and how the wine compares to other 2007 Riojas.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Solid, big and fruity, which is basically what a Campo de Borja Garnacha should be. Sweet red fruits and robust kick define the palate, which is tannic but not obtrusively so. Zesty and a bit of a one-noter, but a nice one. Garnacha with 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dry, dusty and minty on the nose, with cherry, cedar and sweet oak notes. The palate has a hard, clangy bite to it, while the flavors run toward herbal cherry and dried tobacco. Some vanilla and cola along the way bring up the pleasure quotient. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with peach and apple aromas that are 100% normal, while the palate has a chiseled clarity to it that's crisp and appreciated. A flavor profile of dry apple, citrus and dusty spice is good, and the finish is fresh and lemony. Drink right away.",Spain,Albariño
"For a Valencia D.O. wine, this is darn appealing. The nose is warm, rooty and smells of cola nut, fresh raisins and cassis, while the driving palate offers roasted black fruit flavors along with sweet tomato and herbs. Drying and tannic on the finish, but balanced. Neither cooked nor overweight. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pine needle, cedar plank and forest floor define the mature nose, while the full, grabby, tannic palate is loaded with likable cola, black fruit and chocolate flavors. Ripe, pure, rich and tannic, with some bite, burn and ruggedness. Drinkable now but needs food to cut the tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's no denying the wine's power and intensity. It's concentrated like a cement block, with richness, plummy aromas, sweetness and char. But it's also candied and ultrarich in the mouth, with syrupy flavors of berry extract, cola and chocolate. A heavy wine that shows every ounce of its 15.5% alcohol. Ultimately it's more sweet and powerful than it is precise. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"This wine gets it right. The color is dark and opaque, while the nose offers perfume, Middle Eastern spice, fruitcake and solid black fruit. Enticing in the mouth, where full black fruit flavors are pumped up by fine herb and spice notes. And then coffee and chocolate fill the finish. Drink now through 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of cucumber, mineral and melony white fruits are inviting, while the palate is forward and issues bright, solid flavors of green banana, kiwi and papaya. Well made and friendly for a simple, affordable white Spanish blend.",Spain,White Blend
"Opens clean and friendly, with bacon, cassis and plum aromas. The palate is round, fairly large and pure, with tasty black fruit flavors that are sweet, ripe and throw off a bit of licorice. Finishes long, with brown sugar and a hint of toast. Good value Rioja year in and year out.",Spain,Tempranillo
"On the nose, raspberry and plum aromas come with a slight brambly note. The palate is juicy and fresh, with flavors of plum, cherry and a touch of spice. This finishes steady, with focused flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Crisp white-fruit aromas come with a touch of green grass. It feels regular, with briny lime and tart apple flavors.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The nose is big and rubbery, with aromas of bacon, tar and black plum. It feels young and choppy, with a lightly herbal berry flavor that turns more roasted in character as the wine opens. This gets the job done despite showing a roasted flavor throughout.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Orange and nectarine aromas carry the nose to a wide, fairly acidic palate that still manages to fall a little flat in terms of character. Mid-tier notes of orange and stone fruit set up a finish with similar flavors.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is solid stuff for the price, with berry and pencil eraser aromas. It feels more soft than hard, with a jammy mouthfeel and grabby tannins in front of berry and plum flavors that turn medicinal.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fairly generous for a bargain-priced, everyday Rioja. There's bacon, rubber, leather and mild oak on the fruity bouquet, while the palate is concentrated, jumpy and hosts honest red berry fruit flavors along with dry oak and a spot of vanilla. Meets any reasonable expectation of what $12 Rioja should be.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice for a standard, no-frills type of Rioja. The cherry and raspberry aromas are sweet and clean, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of ripe cherry, berry, vanilla and cream. Offers good clarity, power and depth given its price point.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly dry and leafy on the nose, but with beef jerky, cola and mild raisin aromas. The palate is forward, with controlled heat and tannin along with cola, berry and mushroom flavors. Honest in a traditional way, with a long finish that shows a touch of sweet brown sugar. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with sly, clean mineral and white fruit aromas that hook you into its lively but round palate of citrus, green melon and fresh herbs. There's plenty of fruit and acidity to keep it moving, and overall it's a Verdejo done right.",Spain,Verdejo
"Ripe, stout and concentrated on the bouquet, with cassis and lightly roasted berry aromas. Solid and tannic in the mouth, with full plum and cherry flavors. Finishes big and friendly, with a very mild herbal undertone and a slight dose of sauciness. Very nice RDD.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This pink rosado is 80% based on Garnacha, and it's attractive, light on its feet and aromatic. In the mouth, it's wide and creamy but healthy, with a chunky feel and enough acidity to propel flavors of strawberry and spice. Smooth and on the full side, but well made and ready to drink.",Spain,Rosé
"Clean and smooth to open, with a hint of salinity, powdered sugar and peach. The palate is sheer and zesty, with lemon, green apple and tangy acidity. Crisp yet angular on the finish, but good in a narrow, lean, drilling sort of way.",Spain,Albariño
"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice. Nice but like all varietal Gracianos, it's sharp and limited.",Spain,Graciano
"Clean, simple and very much in the style that has made Las Brisas a go-to value white. Verdejo, Viura and Sauvignon Blanc are married and happy; the nose delivers peach and green apple, while the palate hits with grapefruit, apple, lime and mineral flavors. Clean, crisp, easygoing.",Spain,White Blend
"This is clean on the nose, with blackberry and plum aromas. It feels full and solid, bearing flavors of black cherry and dark plum, with a meaty undertone. Mint, spice and black fruit notes carry the finish.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"The medicinal plum aroma comes with a note of celery as well as anise and/or licorice. It feels tight, with rough tannins, then tastes like fresh red berries and plum. This is a bit edgy and choppy feeling, but solid for the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Baked and heavy, this has prune, raisin and jammy berry aromas. The weightiness carries onto the palate, which is chewy and smooth. Flavors of blackberry, spice and jammy syrup lead to a finish with a chocolaty tone. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",Spain,Red Blend
"This smells yeasty and flat, with a heavy, bready quality. The palate feels heady and plump, with a mealy citrus flavor and a lot of foam on the palate. It finishes a little green, grassy and herbal, with a lettuce-like note.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Opens with unique, abnormal aromas of spiced fruit, cardamom and nutmeg. The palate is thick along the edges but lacks body in the middle, while flavors of red berry fruit are chunky, mildly stewy and roasted. Earthy and funky wine, but with good feel and overall good character.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not even El Bosque could escape the difficulties of the cool, extended 2007 vintage. While typically dark and bulky on the nose, it's also dull by Bosque standards, with oaky mocha and coffee stepping in as filler. The body is drawn and tannic, with oak, resin and dark berry flavors. Finishes resiny as well. By no means bad, but given Bosque's precedent it's not stellar.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with floral, blueberry aromas, mineral notes and a spot of jammy candy. The palate is alert and well balanced, with grab and juicy flavors of raspberry and plum offset by a wave of buttery oak. Textured, full and satisfying on the finish. Very nice wine.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"A solid, serious Rioja reserva with licorice, leather, char and good berry aromas. The palate is juicy, pure and tastes of clean black cherry and cola flavors. Picks up steam as it opens up, and then finishes with a light butter streak and proper weight. No complaints; almost makes the upper echelon. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Classic Verdejo that won't wow but will definitely get your palate going. Standard but clean grapefruit and gooseberry aromas lead to citric but balanced flavors of orange, grapefruit and pineapple. On the dot in terms of balance. Drink as soon as possible.",Spain,Verdejo
"Maybe it's the Viura, becuase this $9 wine seems cleaner, rounder and slightly better than the winery's higher-priced pure Verdejos. Look for generic but fresh peach and citrus aromas and then lip-smacking citrus flavors. Finishes composed and clean, with lasting grapefruit flavor. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Earthy and baked on the nose, with rubber, black fruits and warm, almost burnt leather notes. The palate has a lively, dense mouthfeel and flavors of earthy berry fruits and raisin. Definitely on the warm and roasted side but still balanced and interesting. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Minerally, dry and clean white wine made from 60% Xarello and 40% Chardonnay. The nose is peachy, while the palate is spritzy and bouncy, with short, slightly creamy apple, melon and papaya flavors that are true to Xarello. Finishes smooth but a little flat.",Spain,White Blend
"Dark and heavily oaked, so if you're into big wines with char, bacon and a lot of spice, this is it...and it's only $14. The palate is tannic and drawing, but lively and loaded with charred, lemony, black fruit flavors. A junior-level, wannabe bigtime Rioja that hints at the region's potential for greatness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dry, crisp and nice, this has white fruit aromas that are familiar and friendly. It comes across medium bodied, dusty and yeasty, with an apple accent and a vanilla flavor. The finish is lightly toasted and slightly briny.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is fruity but simple on the nose, with plum and cherry aromas. It feels jammy and a touch muddled, with boysenberry, plum and blackberry flavors but not much oak character. It's grippy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Earthy, roasted scents sit atop mild cherry and raspberry aromas that carry a slight green element. It feels shrill but juicy, with red plum and raspberry flavors. It's mild, lightly herbal and snappy on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The tea and raspberry aromas are easygoing, and that best describes this organic Cabernet Sauvignon. It's powerful enough on the palate, with a good berry flavor that tilts towards raspberry. The finish is herbal and peppery.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"This is sweet Amontillado in fine form. The nose is centered around a core of molasses and brown sugar, while the palate bubbles with maple and toffee. Yes, it's a sweeter-styled Amontillado, but the sugar fades on the palate, leaving only the complex residue of caramel, espresso and burnt cinnamon. A lovely wine for any fan of serious Sherry.",Spain,Sherry
"Ultra concentrated and sticky, with unctuous but wholesome raisin aromas taken to a level that's almost heavenly. In the mouth, the maple, cinnamon and brown sugar flavors are lusty and satisfying, and the finish never ends. This is P.X. in awesome form.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Molasses, spice, chocolate and pure raisins define this as classic P.X. It's syrupy but not too much so, with maple, cinnamon and brown sugar flavors. For a sweet and candied dessert wine, it has excellent balance and persistence. A star among many in this category; these wines are hard not to like.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"For an old wine from a weak vintage, this has its positives. For starters, the nose offers a nice mix of dried fruit, tobacco, cedar and fig paste, while the palate is properly acidic and tastes of red plum, raspberry and oak-driven vanilla. At its drinking peak now; with preserved juiciness and lots of kick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nothing over the top but well made and clean, with red fruit aromas that don't overpower. Flavors of peppy plum and berry flavors come across bright and zesty. A comfortable everyday red with with good follow-through and no off aromas, flavors or textures.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Definitely a once-ripe, raisiny wine with hard Toro tannins and molasses aromas and flavors. Borderline syrupy but with enough structure and grip to make the grade. Warming and rich wine, with a fierce strucutre and big tannic framework. Drink now.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Bold and chunky Ribera wine with black fruit aromas that don't tread lightly. The palate is lush and features a nice overall feel, while the flavors of berry fruit and chocolate hint at raisin but don't fully cross the threshhold. Heavier and darker than prior years. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's an exotic twist to the nose, which rests on black cherry, plum and a splash of black coffee. The palate is sound and structured, with dark fruit flavors accented by spice and tea notes. Comfortable on the finish, with good tannins and acids holding it all together. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Full, ripe and so tannic in its present form that it's scratchy and hard on the mouth. Aromas of ripe berry and syrup hint at its core power, while flavors of blackberry, fresh raisin and chocolate are true and good. A powerpacked wine with a fierce mouthfeel; only time can bring it around. Hold until 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Peachy, mildly sweet, smooth and inviting. Godeval always makes a true and easy wine that showcases the essence of Godello but doesn't go off the blueprint. Flavors of apple and citrus are well blended, and the grapefruity finish is only mildly pithy. Eminently drinkable white wine from Spain.",Spain,Godello
"Earthy, meaty and leathery, with an herbal quality to the bouquet. The palate is chunky and soupy, with stewed berry, latent sweetness, and a mild herbal aftertaste. Seems syrupy at points and then fresher and better at other times. Has its good qualities but finishes short.",Spain,Monastrell
"A big, dark, heavily oaked wine with caramel, resin and baked berry aromas. The palate has a thick, meaty feel, slightly abrasive tannins, and then sweet, sticky, woody black fruit flavors. Finishes with brown sugar and more wood flavor; strives for a higher level but gets bogged down with barrel influence.",Spain,Monastrell
"Yeasty, sweet and easy on the nose, with apple, vanilla and pear aromas. The palate has a nice feel and flavors of citrus, spiced meats and baked apple. For basic cava this is focused and forward, with lively acidity and good overall balance.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This has thin fruit aromas, with scents of herb and candied milk chocolate. It's a solid wine for $8, with zesty acidity and standard raspberry and plum flavors. The lightweight finish turns lightly herbal.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This opens with standard cherry and berry aromas before transitioning to a juicy palate with red berry, plum, herb and grass notes. It finishes a little hot and aggressive, but for $4 who's complaining?",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smooth and nutty, with deep secondary aromatics of apricot and orange peel. For a dry, aged Sherry, you can't object to the wine's intense citrus core and outlying toffee and hazelnut flavors. And then on the finish come those classic mushroom and bitter chocolate notes. A real dandy made for connoisseurs more than novices.",Spain,Sherry
"Big, brawny and not entirely welcoming: this Priorat heavyweight is full of licorice and cool black-fruit and cola aromas. The palate is hard as nails, and only time will tell if it softens and finds a sweeter spot. We think it will; in five years it should trade in the current burnt steak notes and fierce tannins for softer touches and more complex flavors.",Spain,Red Blend
"Serious wines from a tiny inland appellation in Catalonia—that's Abadal, a maker of true terroir wines that succeed way more often than they disappoint. This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Syrah is minerally and full of red fruit and vanilla aromas. The palate is husky but correct, with full tannins, a kick of acidity and pure, ripe berry flavors. Even from a tough vintage it justifies its selected status.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark as night, with prune and rubber on the nose along with murk and compost. It's extracted to the max, leaving a rubbery feel to go with supercharged boysenberry flavors. Gritty and forceful on the finish, and pushing tons of runaway flavor. Not for those who like restrained red wines.",Spain,Mencía
"An assault of oak, vanilla and cigar box is the opening salvo, while wave two and three bring raisiny aromas and finally lemon peel. Chunky and tough in the mouth, with vanilla and resin running ahead of acidic raspberry fruit. Finishes with a mix of sauciness, tang, wood notes and candy.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A blend of Tempranillo with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot. Aromas of black cherry, spice, aged cheese and earth are solid, while the palate features good fruit but some weakness in structure. Flavors of black cherry and berry are rich at first but fade fast, while the finish is nice but short on complexity. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A round, full specimen with mineral-laden raspberry aromas and a fresh but serious palate of berry, cherry cough drop and fine rubber. There's a distinct creamy, oaky feel that's confirmed by finishing flavors of vanilla, mocha and woodspice. A step up the ladder for Campo de Borja.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"Coconut and vanilla aromas are squarely in the lead, but the nose's berry base is more than solid. Plump, round and showing good overall balance, with flavors of cola, dark fruit and coconut. A ripe, bulky crianza with plenty of leftover oak on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little heavy and sweet on the nose, but juicy and deep on the palate, with round, pleasant lemon, grapefruit and green melon flavors. Dry, pure and driving white wine with a long, clean finish. Galician Godello in good form.",Spain,Godello
"Apple and mineral aromas are basic but clean, and the palate is fresh and lithe, with little to no extra weight. Flavors of dry apple and fresh corn work well, and while the finish is short and shy, it's crisp and clean. A simple wine with light fruit and easy drinkability.",Spain,White Blend
"Full and blowsy for Verdejo, with orange, grapefruit and minerally aromas. The palate is zesty, with orange, tangerine and passion fruit flavors. With pretty good fruit character, adequate acidity and a slick-feeling finish, this is a good effort that should be drunk right away.",Spain,Verdejo
"Nice on the nose, this has a leafy note and a mellow red-berry aroma. Bouncy and rubbery feeling, it has easygoing flavors of raspberry and plum. It's candied and rubbery tasting on the finish, but good overall.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is snappy all the way, if a touch raw and citric on the palate. Freshness is a virtue on this affordable Rioja, while red plum, raspberry and milk chocolate notes carry the flavor profile. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Briary berry and milk chocolate aromas lead to a tart, alert palate full of red berry, sour plum, vanilla and spice flavors. Juicy acidity creates a long, racy finish that brings lasting raspberry character.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The waxy apple aroma seems cidery and a touch oxidized given how young the wine is. It feels flat and basic, with apricot and peach flavors, and a waxy bitterness to the palate. The finish tastes stalky, like hay or straw. Only 250 cases made.",Spain,Godello
"If at first the wine seems sweet and scattered, just give it time. Soon the nose will knit together to show mocha and that lightly oxidized elegance that is Oloroso. After that there's a palate of coffee, caramel and brown sugar, and a tight, grabby palate that's like your tongue is attached to a magnet. Give this one plenty of air for best results.",Spain,Sherry
"Fino Sherry rarely has this kind of weight and complexity. It's full of spunk, grab and length, and that's probably due to the fact that it's made from Pedro Ximenez grapes and not the more common Palomino. Likely marvelous with garlic shrimp or langostinos.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"On the cusp of unbridled excellence, but since it's Cims' second wine it has its limitations. It's a bit woody and needs to broaden out with time in bottle, but even now the licorice, mineral and ripe plum/prune flavors are delightful. And the oak-driven finish of mocha and coffee seals the package.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pure and unblocked by anything other than raisin, maple and brown sugar aromas and flavors. It's thick as motor oil, with a mile-long finish and lasting notes of pecan pie and cinnamon coffee cake. Maybe it's a little candied and easygoing, but who's complaining?",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"A heavier style of Rioja, with raisin and prune aromas and a brandied character. The palate is expectedly flush and ripe, with weight and size along with black cherry and herbal tea flavors. Shows good stamina and fullness on the finish. Ready to drink now before it starts to fade.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Heavier and oakier than No. 12, and in our opinion not quite as balanced. The nose is rich, minty and raisiny, while the rock-solid palate has fierce tannic grip and flavors of black cherry, tomato and cola. Firm and composed on the finish, but a pounding heavyweight. Drink now thru 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Crisp on the bouquet, with green apple and controlled fresh celery aromas. The palate is also fresh, with basic roundness, bounce and natural flavors of apple cider, citrus and lime. Finishes with a slice of white grapefruit and a tiny spot of pith. Drink immediately.",Spain,Verdejo
"Aromas of sawdust announce oak, but otherwise the nose is earthy and fairly attractive, with plum and rooty notes. Round, ripe, tannic and solid in the mouth, with broad flavors of black cherry, rubber and oak. Shows good grip on a slightly oaky, medicinal finish. Hold another nine months to let the oak settle.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo
"Immediately this strikes you as true Verdejo from Rueda. It has pungency on the nose, with accents of cucumber and celery to the primary passion fruit, apricot and citrus aromas. Plenty of zing to it, and tastes of citrus and fresh green apples. Then tangerine and grapefruit carry the finish. Varietally correct.",Spain,Verdejo
"Quite rustic smelling, with hickory smoke, barbecue sauce, spice and cola aromas. Like most Cigales wines, it has a firm tannic bite and a grating mouthfeel. But the flavors of roast berry, black plum and savory marinade is good and par for the course. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Incognito deftly describes the unusual beet and blueberry aromas on this wine, which is a bit narrow and scracthy. On the plus side, it's concentrated and powerful, with bold berry flavors, tannic grip and herbal influences. Chunky on the finish but lacks the precision and identifiable Ribera del Duero character that a $75 wine should have.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine. It pushes the envelope on ripeness, but that's become the Cirsion way. An awesome wine that deserves a proper decanting.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Colorful and pretty to look at, but a little sweet. The nose has a sweet, maple syrup element along with dry berry fruit aromas. It's healthy and fresh in the mouth, with citrus, cranberry and raspberry flavors. Simple and nice for easy drinking.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A warm, aggressive wine with baked berry aromas, kirsch, bacon and rubber. The palate has hard, astringent tannins but the flavors are good once they air out; there's blackberry, plum and brown sugar. Firms up on the finish as the tannins do their thing. Tasted twice with divergent findings; this note reflects the common traits from both wines.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is the first Las Brisas rosado that's come to us, and it's good in a tangy, tropical sort of way. The nose delivers mango along with light citrus and berry, while the palate is tangy, jumpy, citric and tastes mostly of orange and tangerine. Good but fairly monotone in aromas and flavors; made from 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Rosé
"The first whiff yields mostly raisins, but subsequent sniffs force up lush caramel and malt notes along with a blast of molasses. Cream Sherries by nature are sweet, and this one fits the bill with the full allotment of fig, date and carob flavors. Mocha and espresso on the finish cement this wine's pedigree. Great if you have a sweet tooth and fine even if you don't.",Spain,Sherry
"Really good and interesting Syrah, with chocolate, campfire, menthol and prune on the nose. With airing the wine quickly settles into a deep, smooth berry and chocolate groove, while the finish deals pure tannins and comfort. Ripe but not raisiny; a really nice example of Jumilla Syrah, with 4% Viognier blended in for lightness (and it still weighs in at 14.9%).",Spain,Syrah
"Imagine all of the scents you associate with a Margherita pizza and that's what this wine smells like. The nose is leafy and full of oregano, basil and leather notes, while the flavor profile is pure tomato sauce, herb and spice. A blend of 75% Cabernet Franc and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This is a dark specimen, with black-fruit and raisiny aromas that turn herbal with time. It has rubbery tannins and flavors of plum and herb. Good as a whole but sort of squeeky and hard in feel. A blend of 60% Garnacha and 40% Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Jumpy and nervy smelling, with tottering aromas of jammy berry and strawberry. It feels dilute at first, but more structure and body appear as the wine unfolds. The flavor of jammy raspberry is somewhat herbal, and the finish is light.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Simple, fruity Rioja with mildly candied red berry aromas that turn sweeter and more syrupy with airing. The palate is all zing and zap, with jumpy, mid-weight red berry and herbal flavors. Ditto on the finish, which has a peppery quality.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With dusty apple cider aromas and tingling acidity, this seems a lot like Galician Albariño even though it's from Costers del Segre in Catalonia. Given its price, it boasts solid if pithy apple and gooseberry flavors, modest elegance and only a touch of bitterness on a green fruit finish. Drink soon.",Spain,Albariño
"Nice, simple and fruity, with nothing but standard raspberry fruit and good mouthfeel up its sleeve. The palate is narrow and juicy, while the flavor profile rests on one level: raspberry. Clean and quick on the finish. Perfectly respectable for a $10 Ribera wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts with hard aromas akin to nail polish and rubber gloves. More typical and fruity in the mouth, but it remains kind of lean despite being expansive in the mouth. Tastes like raspberry, with some candy. Gets better as it airs out.",Spain,Grenache
"Maturing fairly well, with brown edges to the wine's earthy hue. The nose is rooty and deep, but there's a definite cheesy, mildly bretty accent to it. And the mouthfeel is defined by major tannic grip and bite. Warm and mildly raisiny, with caramel on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Slightly prickly on the nose, but there's balancing melony sweetness to keep it on line. The palate is fresh and snappy, with citrus flavors, particularly grapefruit. And the finish is lemony and dry. No glaring faults; good Verdejo to drink ASAP.",Spain,Verdejo
"Firm, earthy and rubbery aromas lead to a tight, focused palate with robust black cherry in the lead and black tea and coffee notes along the side. Toasty, dark and a touch bitter on the finish, and overall it's a solid crianza with condensed flavors and a basic mouthfeel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty apple and a clean lightness define this basic, totally enjoyable white blend that is based on the pedestrian Airén grape but features 30% Macabeo. The palate is fresh and easy, with apple, citrus and white pepper flavors. Finishes crisp.",Spain,White Blend
"Big, sweet and deep in black fruits, with aromas of turned earth and sweet spices. The palate is tannic and heavy but offers good pop, and the flavors of blackberry and cola are full-force. Finishes thick and dark, with toasty spice notes and kick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Give this wine credit for consistency: in the three years it's been on the market it has scored the same each vintage. This offering is soft, fleshy and slightly green on the nose, with a wet, easy palate that gives mild citrus, apple and peach flavors. Good in the mouth, with just enough acidity to keep it kicking.",Spain,Viura
"It's easy to throw high scores at almost any well-made P.X. because the wines are so viscous and overwhelmingly sweet. And while this one fits that bill, it has a couple of holes in it, namely a nose that stumbles out of the gate and a mouthfeel that's almost too thick and rich. Very nice but not at that ultrahigh level.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Merlot, Cabernet and a splash of Syrah are brought together in solid, inspiring fashion by this Catalonian winery. Cherry and raspberry aromas are hoisted by full oak, while the finish deals a basket of berry flavors and ripeness. For the most part this is an in-your-face wine that's clearly been made from good grapes.",Spain,Red Blend
"This smells a bit like asphalt and peanuts. It feels angular, with plum, berry and pepper flavors. The finish is spicy, with drying tannins and a lasting leafy flavor.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells granular and jammy, yet it feels snappy and dry, with raspberry, red plum, tomato and briny flavors. The finish is fresh and red in style.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is leathery and stemmy on the nose, with horsey plum and raspberry aromas. It feels narrow, with rubbery, herbal and roasted berry flavors. This is a rustic, roasted wine no matter how you slice it.",Spain,Monastrell-Syrah
"Quiet on the bouquet, this offers aromas and flavors of a wine that's in the early stages of decline. It feels mildly oxidized and tastes of hollow fruit and yeasty vanilla. The finish is mild, with a note of hay.",Spain,Viura
"The nose smells minty and capped with rubbery, blackened aromas. It feels tangy and tannic, with medicinal flavors of berry and resiny oak. It's powerful but rough.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This smells like a new coat of road tar mixed with black olive tapenade and herb. It feels tannic and clumsy, with herb and stewed-fruit flavors. The cooked finish ends with roasted berry and olive notes.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is brambly, stalky and baked on the nose, and the palate is wide, tannic and scratchy. The flavor profile is all roasted plum, bacon and herb accents, finishing stalky and savory.",Spain,Red Blend
"Shows some meat and heft on the nose along with leather, rubber and black fruit. Solid and generic across the palate, with black cherry and berry flavors that are good and steady. Finishes slightly short and bitter, but overall it's a good wine for basic drinking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with earthy, slightly raisiny aromas along with mint, fresh grass and clay. The palate feels clanky and tannic, while the flavors of strawberry and herbal raspberry are good but bland. Shows its share of good components, but overall the wine struggles to distinguish itself among Rioja's top performers.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dry and mildly herbal on the nose, with an aromatic base of raspberry and cherry. At 60% Garnacha and 40% Carignan, this is a standard Priorat blend with good intensity and a slightly reduced mouthfeel. Flavors of baked berry fruit are regular, while chocolaty warmth, fig paste and molasses work the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Full, savory and beefy on the nose, with a snappy, juicy palate that's flavorful and offers pretty good feel. Size is no issue with this wine, which gives you all the basics of red wine while never once hinting at being more than it is.",Spain,Garnacha
"A touch minty and dry smelling, with simple, solid, slightly underdeveloped flavors. All in all, it's hard to find much brightness in this wine; instead it's subdued and chocolaty, and it never really crosses the Rubicon of ripeness. That said, it goes down easy and doesn't burn like many Toro wines.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Dark, roasted lead aromas frame secondary baked black fruit and leather scents, while the palate is oaky, stocky and tannic, with creamy, barrel-led berry flavors and more than adequate balance and freshness. Mocha and toast are key finishing notes, and overall it's a nice blend of 85% Garnacha with Syrah.",Spain,Grenache-Syrah
"One of Spain's top value-oriented rosés. It's inviting, colorful, easy to understand and tasty. Aromas of fresh fruits and melon get it going, while the palate is clean, fresh, only mildly candied and full of cherry and red plum flavors. Scores high by keeping it simple. Drink ASAP.",Spain,Rosé
"A clean, almost oceanic opening is fresh and citrusy as it should be, while the palate shows pulse, balance and a little scour to go with orange, grapefruit and other citrusy flavors. Pithy and biting late, with ample fruit throughout.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"A top-flight Toro that knows how to step on the gas but keep the car centered. Aromas of dried lavender, violets, coffee and black fruit come together marvelously, while the palate is dark as Mud Cake but still loaded with tasty blackberry and black currants. Pure and strapping, and giving all the oomph that Toro is known for.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Potent and raring to go, with lots of young oak and intense fruit that causes the wine to change in the glass in the blink of an eye. What we can tell at this early point of development is that it is saturated, healthy, balanced and clean. There's vibrancy and full tannins, with lip-smacking acidity. Already a good one to ponder, but should be even better from 2009–2011. Just 750 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The Lui & William bodega is behind this outstanding Tempranillo from Toro. The wine shows a brilliant violet tint in front of intense, inky aromas of black cherry and chocolate cake. The palate is superripe and bucks like a bronco; the tannins are dense and form titanic structure, and the finish of coffee and spice hints at a fine cigar. It's a huge load at 15%, so be prepared.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Sweet and lightly floral on the nose, but also kind of generic and wan. The palate is wet, with hollow white fruit and apple flavors. There's snap to the finish but not a lot of flavor other than simple citrus. A good quaffer but nothing more than that.",Spain,Albariño
"Leather, roasted berry and barnyard make for a rustic, warm nose. The palate is grippy, with chewy, roasted black fruit flavors. Meaty, lasting, deep and dense, but also rubbery and a little low on acidic vitality. A Monastrell-Tempranillo blend to drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"Give this stylish wine a few minutes to rev its engine and you'll be rewarded with warm pear and apple aromas. The palate is equally nice as it focuses on apple, pear and peach flavors. The finish is relatively long, clean and pretty, and overall it's a very nice wine with a hint of intricacy and complexity.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"It's not easy assessing this blend of Monastrell and Petit Verdot from a warm vintage. It's fiery and almost citric on the nose, while the palate is ripe as can be, with spicecake and blackberry syrup flavors. It's not missing any potency or ripeness, but the longer you work with it the larger and more medicinal it gets. Think big Zinfandel from California when you take this on.",Spain,Red Blend
"Roasted and rubbery smelling, this has heavy oak influence that yields notes of mint and shoe. Shearing on the palate despite its body, this has flavors of oak-based vanilla, mint and sweet-and-sour plum. Prieto Picudo is a difficult grape to make into good wine.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"This smells like barbecue and Eastern European oak. It feels flat and static, with woody resin and savory flavors to go with notes of nectarine and white grape.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Oily on the nose, this has a distinct whiff of matchstick and popcorn. It feels dry—like almond skins—with oily flavors of walnuts and white fruits. The finish is marked with a mild bitterness as well.",Spain,Macabeo
The candied red-fruit aroma is soft yet snappy. It tastes briny and citrusy before ending with a persistent peppery bitterness and lively acidity.,Spain,Garnacha
"The mildly floral nose leads to a lean and acidic palate, with flavors of lemon and green apple.",Spain,Muscat
"Some Barbier wines, depending on when you catch them, are fresh, pleasant and overdeliver. Others are dull and dead. This one falls into the first category with its melon, apple and Asian pear aromas and flavors. It's lithe, light in body and clean. Good as it gets for $6.",Spain,White Blend
"This seems like the best bet among the Tempra Tantrum lineup. The nose has vibrancy and good fruit content, while the palate is sizable and shows solid balance. Flavors of cherry and red plum are good, and the finish has some length.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Applesauce aromas are open and inoffensive, and the palate is wet and refreshing, with crisp, dry green apple and generic white fruit flavors. As a brut nature, it makes sense that the finish would be wet, lean and taste like lime-infused soda water.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Light raspberry and plum aromas feature a side note of citrus peel, while the flavors are pure but rudimentary dark berry, plum and herb. Good body and structure, but not complex or layered. Finishes peppery and a touch bitter, with short-lasting fruit.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Emilio Moro's first foray into the land of value-priced wine is good but nothing special. The nose is brambly and dusty, like the inside of a Topps baseball card package. Meanwhile, the palate is tight and lean, with cherry flavors infiltrated by dry oak. Overall it's typical of a solid but average red wine.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Condensed, syrupy cherry aromas are a little candied, while the palate is acidic and angular, with juicy, tomatoey cherry and plum flavors. Fairly tight and lean in the mouth, with just enough oak to create a mocha/cocoa accent on the finish. For the price, there isn't much body, variety of flavor or pleasantries.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A mildly baked wine with a touch of raisin, brine and stem on the nose. The palate is grabby, with firm tannins and core flavors of cherry, blackberry and dry oak. Beyond that, there isn't a whole lot else on offer, and the fruit breaks up on the transition from palate to finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Strawberry and raspberry aromas are a little stalky and stemmy, while the palate is entirely regular in feel, weight and flavor. Speaking of flavors, things run a little tart and herbal, while the finish has an acidic yet fresh zestiness. Midlevel in every way.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly saucy on the nose, with jammy, baked fruit aromas hinting at cherry and raspberry. The palate feel is a little tough but healthy, with red fruit flavors accented by vanilla and coconut. Tight, crisp and showing a final wave of tomato on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of Christmas spice, pepper and dried fruit fall more into the traditional category than modern, while the palate is snappy, a little lean and delivers strawberry and raspberry fruit with a light buttery oak note. Tight and dry on the finish, but lean. Ready to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Neutral aromas of citrus and almond skin precede a jumpy, fresh and spritzy palate of green apple and citrus flavors. Tight, crisp, food-friendly white wine with cut and zest. Comfortably fits the Rueda/Verdejo model.",Spain,Verdejo
"Much more fresh and perky than previous years, with grapefruit, nectarine and other citrusy aromas. Pink grapefruit is without doubt the lead player in terms of flavor, and otherwise it's simply a tight, citric wine with scour and poise. Drink now.",Spain,Godello
"Big, meaty and broad, with thick, masculine coal, pepper and blackberry aromas. This marks a nice comeback for Abadia Retuerta, which had some weak wines in 2002 and '03; this single-vineyard Syrah is lush, loaded and bursting with char, chocolate and deep fruit. It has size, power and balance pulling it in the right direction. Probably better in another year or so.",Spain,Syrah
"In 2001 (the best Rioja vintage prior to 2004) this wine cost $15 and rated 87 points. Now it's $42 and it's worth it. Smooth and inviting on the nose, with coconut, toast and black fruit aromas. In a word, the bouquet is inviting. And the palate seals the deal; there's a creamy feel and loads of fruit and vanilla to fill the gaps. Drink now through 2009.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is far and away the best Mirto of all time. It's ripe and brawny, with bacon and black-fruit aromas that put it squarely into the Nuevo Classic mold. In the mouth, licorice and nutmeg flavors give character to smooth blackberry and dark plum flavors, while the finish is cushioned, herbal and long. Immediately appealing but with five to ten years of aging potential.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Complex and showing so much of what we love about Ribera del Duero. Baking spices, mature fruit and leather grace the stately bouquet, while the palate sings a pretty tune of berries, plum and brown sugar. There's thrust and potency to the mouthfeel but also a toasty, rich, mocha character. Drinking good now but should hold in there for another five to eight years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Berry fruit and mild leather open this good little bargain. There's adequate body and fullness, some oak, and then bright, fresh berry, herb and spice flavors. Finishes dry and lightly toasted, with coffee notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with sharp cherry, cola and mint aromas. The palate is fairly acidic and sheering, but it's also zesty and fresh, with clean berry and mild raisin flavors. Offers reasonably good length, with an acidic choppiness balanced by good fruit flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mas de Monistrol always seems to please. This rosado is dusty and smoky on the nose, with lightly roasted fruit aromas peeking through. The flavors are more in the cherry and cranberry field, so in terms of mouthfeel it leans toward tangy, racy and pulsing. And who would want it any other way?",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Any fan of sweet Sherry should not turn a cheek against this jammy, figgy, rich wine that could use a cut of ice and citrus peel but isn't at all bad on its own. Aromas of burnt caramel are just right, while the finish dries out long before turning cloying.",Spain,Sherry
"Spicy strawberries on the nose lead straight to a full-bodied, totally balanced and healthy palate that is eager to deliver zesty raspberry and tea-like flavors. Not hard to enjoy, with peppery rosé tannins and good length. Freshness is key to this wine, and as of June 2007 it was drinking perfectly. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Rosé
"Smooth on the nose, with baked-fruit aromas along with touches of forest and mineral. For a previously untried Monastrell from southern Yecla, we like the wine's light fruit character and apple-skin tannins. Finishes with spice and cinnamon. Drinking very well now.",Spain,Monastrell
"Always one of Catalonia's more elevated cavas, this version opens with spiced dried apple aromas and a bit of yeast and dough. The palate is both sweet and tangy, with tangerine as the lead fruit. And the finish is consistent and moderately deep. A handsome wine with character. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"As long as the price keeps creeping up on this wine, we're happy to say that the quality seems better and the oak level lower than in past years. This version of Milmanda offers roasted corn, walnut and other smoky, barrel-based aromas. Throughout the fruit is shy but the mouthfeel and oak are smooth. Finishes with a blast of white pepper and toast.",Spain,Chardonnay
"An idiosyncratic wine, offering a yeasty orange marmalade aroma followed by a razor-sharp palate with sour citrus and apricot flavors. It's grating and citric on the finish, with a yeasty offset.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Heavy and dark in color, this is stalky on the nose, with a compost component that doesn't scream “fresh and ready.” It feels fairly snappy, but it tastes tart and slightly vegetal before finishing with rhubarb flavors.",Spain,Trepat
"A tight note of spearmint defines the nose. The palate follows suit: It's pinched and hard, with outsized acidity leading to a lemony palate, with searing cherry and red plum flavors. It doesn't waiver on the finish.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Rubbery on the nose, this has berry aromas lurking below. On the palate, it feels acidic, with tart raspberry flavors. It's lean on the finish, with a touch of oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The name means “Sea of Vines,” and that's what you see in Rías Baixas. Here, we have a dry, crisp white with apple and apricot on the nose and a bit of roundness, weight and chunkiness in the mouth. Tastes of pithy apple and apricot, with mild bitterness on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Dry and not all that fruity up front, with a blast of oak. The palate shows weight and bold acidity, which pumps up the lemon, apple and pineapple flavors. A bit sour, scouring and sharp, but also cleansing and fresh. Blunt white wine.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc-Verdejo
"Dark in color, with aromas of bacon fat, blackberry candy and vanilla. The body is medium to full, with grabby tannins that support mildly medicinal blackberry and cherry flavors. Finishes clean and regular, with no nasty residue or forced oak.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"A tutti-frutti nose leans toward candied cherry and red plum, while the palate is lean, a touch shrill and tastes of lightly herbal red fruits. Nothing heavy or weighty here; it's a simple, perfectly good everyday Rioja with a hint of oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A rough, raw wine from Galicia that starts with a swirl of hard fruit aromas, heat and chemical. The palate is jacked up with berry fruit, tannic bite and power, and the finish is chewy and rugged. Packed with color and flavor but also aggression. Definitely not for everyone.",Spain,Red Blend
"Neutral, clean, good white wine for the money. The nose features green apple and lemon, and the low-octane body shows brine, citrus fruit flavors and pithy notes. White grapefruit and orange flavors carry the simple finish to a good ending.",Spain,Macabeo-Moscatel
"Light, simple and ready to drink. More acidic than some, with a cleansing, almost sour flavor package of green apple and lemon. Shows a lot of unabsorbed acidity on the finish, which forces the wine toward being crisp and minimalist. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Aromas of rubber, smoked beef, syrupy berry and buttery oak are inviting enough, while the palate has edgy acidity that pushes the wine's black cherry element while cutting an obvious oak dosage. Accents of tea, herbs and spice give it character; finishes with an obvious kick of butter and resin.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"A little saucy and leathery on the nose, but there's also licorice, blackberry and woody aromas to ponder. Flush and well composed on the palate, with plum, raspberry and mild salty, savory notes. Finishes with good feel but a slight herbal taste of tomato and/or oregano.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bursts with bright, linear cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors, but it's not caustic, sharp or grating. Acidity at peak power yields a zesty, racy personality while a blanket of vanilla flavor softens the cherry and raspberry fruit. Crisp and a good food wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark purple in color, with can't-miss aromas of prune and raisin. The palate is predictably soft, with manageable heft but low acidity and thus very soft edges. Flavors of baked black fruits are warm but short, and the oak is plentiful. A little too ripe and raisiny to rate higher.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice value red wine with solid black fruit aromas, licorice and crushed mineral notes. It's flush and showing good volume, and the plum/berry core flavors have a vanilla accent. Mildly medicinal on the finish but overall it offers good power, structure and concentration.",Spain,Grenache-Syrah
"Powerful and precise, but with a cloudy color. On the nose and in the mouth this aged version of the venerable Drysack shows considerable freshness, tang and complexity. It's edgy yet deep, with caramel and mushroom notes going head to head with acidic intensity. Sherry is rarely more balanced than this; it's lively and rich, balanced yet racy.",Spain,Sherry
"For a few years running we've been singing the praises of Abadal, a label from Catalonia that has been producing hit upon hit. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah from the excellent 2001 vintage is in super form; the wine has a ripe, integrated nose of cocoa, dark fruit and chocolate, while the palate is bold and loaded with vivacious cherry and blackberry flavors. From front to center to back, this wine has it all going in the right direction. Good now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"A floral, heavy style of blended white made from Macabeo, Gewürztraminer and Chardonnay. It has an exotic streak to the aromas along with smoked ham, fennel seed and gardenia. The palate is thick and tastes of papaya, salami and baked apple. It's a hodgepodge of abnormal aromas and flavors, but all totaled it works pretty well.",Spain,White Blend
"For the most part this is smooth, ripe red wine. At 50% Cabernet and 50% Merlot the flavors and style should be familiar, but still this wine has its own Catalonian personality. It's concentrated and ripe but not all that heavy. Overall it's very Mediterranean/mountainous and not very New World at all. A fine match for good food.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Dry, pure and attractive on the nose, with crisp apple and lemon-lime flavors. This wine performs on an even keel from start to finish, and it's dry, tangy and correct as far as brut nature cavas go. Verges on elegant.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Savory mint and herbal aromas accent leafy, classic red fruit on the bouquet, while plum, berry, mineral, black olive and herbs work the palate. The wine transitions from one stage to the next without much trouble, and within the folds there are some complexities. A measurable step up from the bargain barrel milieu.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Tempranillo and Cabernet Franc aren't often thrown together, but here the marriage works. The nose offers herbal, leafy aromas from the CF, while berry fruit and oak carry the rest of the show. The palate is slightly crisp and racy, but its lightweight character is welcome. This is yet another well-made, interesting wine from one of our favorite obscure Spanish labels.",Spain,Red Blend
"Darker red in color, with a dusty, full bouquet. Flavors of plum, raspberry and apple skins are appealing and on the money, as is the mouthfeel and the fresh, drying finish. There seems to be a little bit of everything running through this cava, and the end result is rock solid.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Solid black cherry aromas distinguish this wine from the competition. It has poise for a Madrid wine, and the mix of Tempranillo, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon delivers a saturated palate with natural, full-bodied flavors that aren't too infused with oak. Concentrated and well made, with good size.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pretty pear, apple and other dusty white-fruit aromas start this cleansing cava on its way to pure citrus, Granny Smith apple and lime flavors. It has a mildly linear, angular feel but it doesn't come across sheer or sour; to the contrary, it's balanced and generous with its fruit.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A barrel-heavy blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo? That's what this is, so expect popcorn and bland white fruit along with plenty of acidity. On one hand, it's an angular, sour wine that makes you wonder; on the other hand, it blends toast, butter, baked apple and lemon into a nutty whole that's not bad. Has both merits and faults.",Spain,Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc
"Light, floral and almondy, with hints of pear, apple and buttercup on the nose. More creamy and soft than acidic, with pear and vanilla flavors. The finish holds steady for a while, and overall the wine is likable. 75% Viura and 25% Chardonnay.",Spain,White Blend
"Dark, fiery, forceful and woody, with aromas of sawdust atop black fruit. The palate is zesty, lively and hard, with biting tannins raising up flavors of blackberry and pepper. Acidic, rough and tough, but with good flavors and a decent amount of integrity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rubber and bacon aromas announce that this wine has some size, depth and concentration along with oak shadings, while the palate is fruity, acidic and tangy, with generic berry flavors and an added dose of oak-driven bacon and rubber. Solid at first and then thin on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With good fruit and controlled aromas, it does what young Toro should when done well. Tight in the mouth, with bold black cherry flavors, it bites down with young, big tannins, but it doesn't burn or grate. Shades of mint and chocolate help it along.",Spain,Tempranillo
Twizzler and other red candy aromas lead to a creamy feeling yet acidic palate that tastes like raspberry extract. Sharp acidity prevents what would otherwise be a cloying wine.,Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"This smells like applesauce and pear, feeling tight as a drum on the palate, with sharp nectarine and apricot flavors. It's tart and crimped on the finish.",Spain,Viognier
"The nose smells flat, with a scant scent of peach. It feels acidic and lacks body, with flavors of sour apple, dried papaya and bitter almond. A blend of 50% Macabeo and 50% Airen.",Spain,White Blend
Loud citrus and berry aromas precede an overloaded palate that carries stalky plum flavors. Pickled tasting on the finish.,Spain,Rosé
"Salmon in color, this is pulpy and perfumed on the nose, with an artificial leaning. Overly foamy on the palate, this has a bitter, herbal flavor.",Spain,Garnacha
"Grassy and pungent, with lime, citrus and white pepper on the nose. Tangy and simple across the palate, with basic pineapple and passion fruit flavors. Good but thins out on the finish, leaving leftover acidity.",Spain,Verdejo
"Lean, focused cherry and raspberry aromas properly portend a snappy, fresh, edgy palate of semitart red plum and raspberry flavors. Buttery oak brings some softness, while the finish is a bit hot and high in acid. More traditional in style than modern.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dalmau, the ultrapremium Tempranillo blend from Marques de Murrieta, is 65% pricier in 2004 than '03. And that might be justified. This is a spectacular wine in every sense of the word. The nose blends alluring scents of smoke, asphalt, rubber and black fruit. The palate is saturated and smooth, with black cherry and blackberry flavors leading the way. Coffee, berry pie and mocha help the finish hold court and then fade away. Already good but best from 2010–2020.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"For the second vintage in a row, Vall Llach's signature red blend is out on its own. The bouquet is round and deep, with alluring cola, mint and blackberry aromas. The palate is alive but still quite dark, with huge black plum and blackberry flavors. Super long on the finish, with a subtle streak of vanilla and coconut. Delicious but also deft. 450 cases produced.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is Albariño in fine form. The nose is succulent and marble-smooth, with pure citrus and melon aromas. The palate is lively but refined, with exuberant citrus flavors that come on strong but with proper restraint. Long and ripe on the finish, which only adds to the experience. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Big in every way, with tons of new oak, popcorn and coffee sitting on top of dark-fruit aromas. Modern despite its incorporation of several indigenous grapes, this blend delivers a blast of roasted black cherry and plum flavors in front of a resiny finish that's dripping with menthol and molasses. Unique if a touch syrupy; it's clearly shooting for the modern style.",Spain,Red Blend
"Charcoal, cola and licorice are all components of this wine's dark and meaty nose. And the palate hardly disappoints; there's depth and harmony to the berry, coffee and mocha flavors. It feels good and has just enough kick to keep you thinking. A really nice crianza that will settle and only grow more complex over the next few years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit of choppy wood announces a fully oaked wine, and yes, it's a touch hard-coated. But underneath the veneer of barrel there's lively red fruit and a natural brambly character. The palate is just acidic enough to be lively, and the finish is healthy and settles upon chocolate due to the wine's generous oaking. Very good mouthfeel and depth make this more than solid. Drink now–2011.",Spain,Red Blend
"Honey and corn syrup aromas tell you this is rich, but what you don't realize so easily is how complex and expansive this Muscat is. The flavors of honey, banana and clover start out as sweet and unctuous, but then they unfurl to show depth, complexity and length. In the end you realize that this is all about pure, unrefined power and purity. Drinking it is like a rush of natural sugar to the brain.",Spain,Muscat
"Light in color, with a candied, red fruit nose that's sweet and not very oaky. The palate is juicy but simple, with flavors of herbal raspberry and spice. Not overly complex but good due to its fresh, floral outlook.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet, open and floral, like a Malvasia or Moscatel. For a clear, easy quaffer this is nice. It tastes like lime and lychee, and also a little bit like applesauce. Nothing special in terms of finish or intensity, but for a light, tropical white wine it gets it done.",Spain,Viura-Chardonnay
"Aromas of pineapple, cider and citrus are good but basic. It's fleshy and soft in the mouth (call it pulpy) with mild grapefruit, passion fruit and tropical melon flavors. Finishes soft, chunky and pithy. Drink ASAP.",Spain,Verdejo
"Nothing is exciting or disappointing about this center-lane Viura (with 10% Malvasia). It's neutral on the nose and then creamy, soft and easy in the mouth, with papaya and cantaloupe flavors. Finishes mellow, with a spot of bitterness.",Spain,White Blend
"Vionta aims for the racy, lively style of Albariño, and for the most part it nails it. Aromas of peach and nectarine are youthful and pure, while the flavors of apple, peach and lime are pleasant. Not over the top but instead it achieves balance and ease. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Spain,Albariño
"Bursting, powerful Cabernet from Jumilla is not an everyday event, so keep an eye out for this dark, sweet blackberry- and chocolate-driven youngster that only saw a few months in oak. The finish is like mud pie and it darts comfortably between exuberance and balance.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"May be getting old but still welcoming and mostly fresh. Citrus, melon and mango flavors are flush and clean, and the finish is racy and fluid. Normally Albariño is a one-year wine, meaning you should drink it in the year immediately after harvest. Here's an '05 that's hanging in there and still showing kick. Drink now for best results.",Spain,Albariño
"Rooty, tough aromas are brambly, while the palate is narrow in feel, drying and tastes of herbal raspberry and cherry. Quite snappy and a little sharp, with a quick finish of red fruit, tomato and zest. Could improve with aging, but at this point the wine, while solid, seems lacking in stuffing.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"For a Ribera rosé, this gets it mostly right. The nose is neutral and standard, while the spunky palate sports good acidity and flavors of strawberry and raspberry. Wet and refreshing on the finish, and good overall.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells a bit cheesy and sour at first, and soon after oak and mild berry fruit take over. On the palate, it's dry, peppery and grabby, with solid but common plum and raspberry flavors. Tomato notes and herbal flavors come up on the finish, but all together it's a good but regular Ribera wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"For a Priorat red, this is lean and snappy, with hot, stemmy aromas and light-bodied, racy fruit flavors. It's a blend of six different grapes, and overall it comes across just well enough to be worth a go. That said, it is kind of short and scratchy given its domain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark in color but a bit hot and clunky on the nose, where oak-based vanilla helps mask its true identity, which is choppy and tart. In between the wine's tang and zest, there's moderate sweetness, vanilla and mild wood notes stemming from the five months it spent in barrel.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A touch stalky on the nose, but after that it gets things mostly right. The fruit aromas and flavors are subdued, with jammy raspberry notes leading the way. There's no overt burn or grating feel, and that's good with inexpensive, niche-filling concept wines like this. Fine if you're expectations are modest.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Strawberry and raspberry aromas set up a reedy, flush palate with stemmy, candied strawberry flavors. Turns green and bitter on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"An improvement from recent years, but that may be a reflection of when we're tasting the wine. At this point in time it's showing dusty plum and raspberry aromas and good body weight. The flavors of raspberry and cherry are solid, while the finish is cleansing. Beyond palatable; it's really a nice rosé from Tempranillo.",Spain,Tempranillo
"For a large-production, simple red wine, this Garnacha-Syrah blend is good. The nose features red licorice candy, cherry and raisin aromas, while the palate is round, fairly smooth in feel, and tastes of bright red fruits and milk chocolate.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"A little heat on the nose is acceptable given that the remaining cherry and plum aromas are pure. A bit acidic on the palate but staunchly fresh, with good fruit flavor in the red plum category. Cleansing due to higher acidity, with hints of mocha and mineral.",Spain,Grenache
"Opens with tight black cherry and raspberry aromas, but also a whiff of pine and chemical. The palate is round, full and tannic, with snappy berry flavors accented by balasmic notes, oak resin and vanilla. Finishes with traditional vanilla-dill notes and a slight stemminess.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Méntrida is an island wine region in the middle of central Spain, and this blend of Garnacha and Syrah is lively, juicy and delicious. The nose is deep and luscious, with mounds of cassis and blackberry. The spunky palate shows big tannins but plenty of offsetting fruit and pulp. Finishing notes of chocolate and pepper leave a positive lasting impression. Should age for several more years; 400 cases produced.",Spain,Grenache-Syrah
"So thick and rich that it seems to fall apart in the mouth in pieces. There's rum raisin on the bouquet and then backing aromas and flavors of prune, orange rind, toffee, peanut and chocolate. It's rich, sweet and unctuous from start to finish, but with just enough balance and acidity to keep it upright. Sincere and delicious.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"A clear step up from the overdone 2003 Propiedad, this vintage is sweet and easy to like. There's a blast of hickory smoke on the new-oak nose, but also black fruit and molasses. The ripe palate deals chewy fruit, medium tannins and moderate length. It's a charming but blunt wine, and all in all it's probably not one to hold for too long. Drink now through 2009.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Having never tried this producer's wines, we can only heap praise on this medium-bodied, more modern style of Rioja. Bacon, rubber and raspberry work the bouquet, while the palate is ripe and full as it pumps forth with pure red-fruit flavors. Firm and mildly tannic, with ample new oak leaving lasting flavors of vanilla, coffee and pepper. Hold for another year or so, if possible; 900 cases produced.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"These are the kinds of Best Buys we love. In the case of Muruve's '04 crianza, the wine overdelivers by a sum and a half. The nose brims with cola, tar, menthol and other dark aromas, while the big but balanced palate delivers a belt of blackberry and plum flavors along with chewy, ripe tannins. Good now with grilled meat, but will age for another five years should you want to invest in more than one bottle.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Fruit overload and gumball richness define the syrupy, super ripe nose on this Monastrell (Mourvèdre) Cabernet Franc blend from Valencia. This is big stuff, with blackberry, prune and chocolate cake qualities. It's thick, intense, tannic and will continue to be lively and drinkable for another six or seven years. A surprise wine; 100 cases produced.",Spain,Monastrell
"Light in color and more neutral and clean smelling than anything. The palate is airy and offers simple, pleasant melon and pear flavors. About as easygoing as they come; a no-frills white wine that's tasty, lightweight and a bit sweet.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"A bit hard and sharp on the nose, but on the plus side it's clean and direct. The palate follows suit; it's reasonably balanced, with forward strawberry, raspberry and mocha flavors. Dry and quick on the finish, with a mild resiny leftover oak character.",Spain,Monastrell
"Full and sweet smelling, but also a little cidery. The palate is drawn, narrow and citrusy, with grapefruit, passion fruit and orange for core flavors. Finishes citrusy and a touch vapid; overall it shows flashes of elegance but not enough to rise above average.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light and citrusy on the nose, with hints of spice, sweet cherry and dusty earth. The palate has a drawn, lean feel along with freshness and flavors of red fruits, plum and mild spice. Offers enough good character and power to be worth a go.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet and raisiny, and not in the best shape. This mature Rioja is drying in the mouth and a bit overaged already; it tastes of raisin, coffee and spice, but there's a bit of heat and baked character to it as well. For an '04 reserva it's just not as lively and fresh as it should be.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Some things never change. Put this sturdy, mildly nutty and fairly bright cava on that list. Year after year, the palate remains comfortably sweet and bubbly, but not too much so. And the round apple, pear and lime flavors even bring a shade of spice along for the ride. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"If all you're after is size, then sign on the dotted line. This blend is a monster that weighs in at 15.5%, so be ready for intensely sweet flavors of grape essence and licorice. To this judge, the wine has a lot of gumption but isn't what I'd want to drink glass after glass, day after day. It's lumbering, heavy but oh so sweet and dessert-like.",Spain,Red Blend
"Wet and wild, with raspberry aromas that sweeten into red licorice. The palate is kind of sweet, but it's also sturdy and full of ultraripe, almost sugary Monastrell flavors. You wouldn't call this precise or particular, but works. Drink now.",Spain,Monastrell
"For a consistently pleasing brut nature (no added sweetness), Juvé y Camps is one place to turn. This wine is dominated by match stick, apple, pear and light vanilla aromas, which are backed by meet-in-the-middle flavors of citrus, apple and celery. It's a bit sheer and tangy, but it's also genuinely refreshing and not the least bit sweet.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Pop the cork and look for a bulky Mencía from the little-known region of Ribeira Sacra in Galicia. The wine has rubber, bacon and plum aromas, and then an enamel-like palate of black cherry and herbs. Tough stuff, but unique.",Spain,Mencía
"Smells earthy, leathery and a bit gaseous before you get to a broad palate of stretched berry flavors, vanilla and herbal notes. There are good points here but also gaps in the wine, including a tomatoey quality to the flavor profile. Improves a bit with airing but still it struggles to make the grade.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A simple but pleasant Ribera red with berry-cherry aromas. The palate has a staunch, tannic grab to it as well as flavors of raspberry, black plum and earth. A wine that has o.k. length and solidity to the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A heavy, briary wine that opens with a full blast of earthy compost and burnt leaves. The palate features pointed berry fruit along with a wall of oaky coconut and vanilla. Creamy on the finish, at least in terms of flavor, with lasting vanilla.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Woody and dried out, with oak-based spice and burnt elements on the bouquet. The palate is gritty and acidic, with tart, limited, earthy cherry flavors. Not a disaster, but for a $46 wine from a great vintage it isn't offering many reasons to explore it.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Warm, baked aromas smell of clay and raisin, and later a wave of minty green enters the picture. The palate is sort of lean, with some holes in the fabric, while flavors of wild berry and black fruits fold in a heavier note of molasses. Limited in its virtues; short in complexity.",Spain,Tinta Fina
"A little dusty and spicy on the nose, with pear and apple checking in. The palate has spritz and acidity, while the flavors run sweet with ripe apple, pineapple and tropical fruit. Tastes like orange candy on the finish, with a sugary lasting impression. Good but needs more balance and harmony.",Spain,Godello
"Dark and powerfully oaked despite its 5-month pedigree. Mint, tar, shoe polish and blackberry work the bouquet, while the palate is structured and tight but also quite dark and woody. Mocha, butter and pepper flavors carry the finish on this healthy and structured wine that may also be too oaky for its own benefit.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"All three Vall Llach wines are stellar in 2005 and get Editors' Choice status. Idus is a big load that starts out sharp and toasty and then quickly settles into a saturated groove of black fruit, licorice, coffee and mocha. It's dark, deep and ripe, with slight mineral underpinnings. Carignan is the lead grape, with Merlot, Garnacha, Cabernet and Syrah filling out the blend.",Spain,Red Blend
"Conde de la Salceda is owned by the Chivite family of Navarra. The wine straddles the fine line between classic and modern Rioja. The 2004 is the best Conde yet, with smoke, leather and baked plum aromas followed by a silky palate housing lovely dark berry, tobacco and spice flavors. Drink now or hold for another 12 years; it's that versatile.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromatically this is evocative; there's spice, tobacco and dried fruit in addition to classy, balanced oak. The palate dances with cherry, dried plum and earthy spice notes, while the finish is elegant, smooth and features just the right amount of tannic grab. A very nice, true-to-the-terroir type of Tempranillo.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With a gold glint and put-together aromas of peach, candle wax, mineral and citrus, this is very nice Albariño that's now fully ripe, mature and drinking at its best. The palate pits juicy melon against dry papaya; it's big, ripe, full and the perfect foil for all sorts of white-friendly foods. Only 1,000 cases made of this reserve-style wine.",Spain,Albariño
"This is an unusual white blend from Mallorca that uses the native Premsal grape along with 15% Muscat. It smells a little funky and sweaty, and while the feel is angular the palate isn't bad. Tastes sort of fruitless, with a bit of green melon. O.K. for a weird wine, but it's hollow and short on flavor.",Spain,White Blend
"Sweet, candied, minty and easygoing on the nose, then crisp and fresh in the mouth, with basic, stripped-down plum, berry and citrus flavors. Finishes fruity and fresh, with a mild candied sweetness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rustic, flat and chemical at first, with offsetting caramel sweetness to the nose. The palate is big and dark, with herbal, candied flavors and a peppery, creamy finish. Not the most pure wine to process but for 85% Alicante Bouschet it's not bad and seems to get better in the glass.",Spain,Red Blend
"A big, jammy youngster with earth and rubber on the nose. Firm, bullish and tannic but also lively, dark-fruited and touched up with bacon. Finishes with heat and bitterness. Meaty and rugged yet still pretty good.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit jumbled early on, and then more open and minerally. The palate is chunky but hollow, with melon and green fruit flavors. Finishes with a touch of citrus and a soft, quick fade. Bland but easy to drink.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc-Verdejo
"Initially, lemony aromas and flower notes stir interest, while the palate has a medium-to-full feel and pumped-up melon and floral flavors. But with time it grows softer, more pithy and dull. Ultimately it lacks spine and purity of flavors, but how much can you expect from a $10 La Mancha white?",Spain,Verdejo
"Ripe apple and nutty aromas suggest some light oak, while the palate is wet at first and then more drawn and dry as it moves along. Flavors of apple and spice are mildly alluring, while the finish is chunky and broad. Made from the uncommon Vijiriega grape and hails from Granada.",Spain,White Blend
"Opens with dusty dry-fruit aromas along with weight and rubbery notes. The mouth is juicy and tannic, with tough but respectable plum and cherry flavors accented by firm tannins and herbal notes. Dry, quick and herbal on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells like red licorice nibs and stemmy, candied fruit, while the palate is medium bodied, reasonably well balanced and juicy, with berry and plum flavors. It darkens a bit on the finish, where chocolate notes enter the picture. Good for what is a very regular wine.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Dark, bulky and fairly oaky for a wine of modest DNA. The palate is forceful, juicy and high in acidity, while the flavors of grape juice and black plum are semisour, with leftover oak and vanilla dominating the finish. An average wine on its best day.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This Freixenet brand consists of 100% Xarello grapes, and it's nice on the nose and clean as a whistle. Flavors of apple cider, peach and melon are subdued and a bit sweet, while the feel is juicy and tightly wrapped. Nice for a Catalonian white table wine. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"A very solid and consistent rosé cava. Opening aromas of spiced fruit, pepper and juicy citrus raise this to a higher level, and the raspberry and nectarine flavors are snappy and sure. A pleasant bubbly with a dash of complexity. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Ginger ale and Sprite are the first things that come to mind when you give it a sniff. The palate shows ripe and sweet orange, tangerine and pink grapefruit, while the back end is lean and citrusy but far short of complex. Good in a standard way.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Mostly Garnacha (with 12% Syrah), this Mediterranean-styled wine is locked and loaded on the nose: There's a ton of mineral, sunshine and earthy blackberry aromas. The palate is full with cherry and raspberry, and the acidity is strong enough to keep the wine stable. In the end it's almost lean and perky.",Spain,Garnacha
"More in the Champagne style, meaning the nose is yeasty and toasty, and the color is more gold than pale yellow. The palate offers wholesome apple, lemon and green herb flavors, and the finish is dry and peppery, with some bitterness. Strives for more complexity than most cavas, and it gets there for the most part.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The bouquet deals some peach, custard and a slight hint of oak, while the palate runs racy, fresh and citrusy. If you like a fresher style with strong orange and tropical fruit flavors, this is your ticket. It's a controlled wine that meets expectations. With 15% Parellada.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Ripeness in inland Catalonia is always going to be challenging, so it is no surprise that the wine features snappy red-fruit aromas and flavors, with herbal touches and lots of length. Neither outrageous nor extraordinary; just good wine. 85% Cabernet and 15% Syrah.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"Racy red wine, with mild bramble and brine aromas to go with spunky cherry-plum flavors. Quite zesty, bright and juicy, but solidly put together and not overly acidic. Even shows a distant chocolaty side, which is not uncommon for young Garnacha.",Spain,Garnacha
"No one says Verdejo is an ager, but this '08 is fading. The nose is soft and peachy, with weight and vanilla. The palate is equally soft and melony, and the green-fruit flavors are starting to turn mealy. Still good enough, but without much spunk it might be better to wait for 2009.",Spain,Verdejo
"How many $5 wines are this good? Not many. The nose is zesty and aggressive but settles and doesn't offend, while the juicy, fresh palate has bright cherry and raspberry flavors. Basic, ripe, clean red wine.",Spain,Syrah
"Aromas of medicinal berry, sucking candy, rhubarb and raspberry are a touch gawky, but the snappy palate of blueberry and boysenberry is good. Fresh, racy and simple red wine. 50% Syrah and 50% Tempranillo. 25,000 cases produced.",Spain,Syrah-Tempranillo
"Dark and spicy, with rubber and baked-fruit aromas giving way to herbs, clove and other alluring spice scents. As might be expected from a wine bearing Alvaro Palacios' signature and approval, the final product is smart and snappy, with blackberry, herbs and barrel char all making themselves noticed. Good now and for the next several years.",Spain,Red Blend
"A firm wine with fine structure and balance. The nose is fiery and rustic early on, then seductive as it opens up. The palate exhibits currents of raspberry, cherry and plum, and below the surface there's vanilla and brown sugar. A smooth operator that shows the Campo Viejo brand in its best light.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Vall Llach Embruix may be the winery's base-level offering but it's no starter wine. Five grapes led by Garnacha are blended to achieve a potent and piercing brew of blueberry aromas, black cherry and cassis flavors, and a rich, chocolaty finish. Modern in style, and making no apologies for it. Equal in quality to the excellent 2004 Embruix.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark and baked on the nose, with rubbery aromas. Strong, strapping and tannic Tempranillo with roasted black fruit flavors and herbal shadings. A rough, tough style with heat and black coffee on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells like air freshener and white flowers. The palate is spongey and a bit low on life, while the flavors lean toward citrus but lack purity and zap, which is further drilled in on the waxy finish. Once upon a time Basa was a leading white value from Spain; lately it has been average at best.",Spain,White Blend
"Opens with pasty, oaky aromas and very little fruit or clarity. The palate is flat in feel and thick, with woody, medicinal flavors. Finishes with a pile of woodspice and not a whole lot else. Generic and uninspired for the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light on fruit but loaded with mocha and milk chocolate aromas. The palate is lean to average in feel and lightly stewed tasting, with creamy, soupy red berry flavors as the backdrop. Finishes with a persistent baked   flavor and a final dollop of milk chocolate.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Sweet, candied, oaky aromas get it going, and the palate, while tannic and tough, is thin in its midsection. Flavors of vanilla and marshmallow lead the way, yet the finish falls off fast. Decent wine but shows a forced, candied, oaky personality.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Chunky and bold smelling, with bulky berry aromas that are o.k. but not alluring or elevated. The mouth and flavors are more of the same; there's tight, dark, tannic berry flavors along with toast and burnt rubber late. Finishes with mild heat and oak-based coconut notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The opening runs a bit sour, tomatoey and stemmy, while the palate offers darkness and weight along with savory, herbal flavors that come across earthy and burnt. Tastes as much like tomato paste and herbs as it does berry fruit. Drink now or let it pass.",Spain,Red Blend
"Straightforward and clean, with simple cherry and plum aromas. The palate is tart, juicy and a touch citric, with lightweight cherry skin flavors and a cleansing, fresh, somewhat acidic finish. Tangy and sharp, but not bad for the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not bad for a mass-produced wine. The nose has a distinct sweet, candied character that's like marshmallow, and there's also some burnt stem and bramble thrown into the mix. Tastes mildly pickled, stemmy and burnt, with grabby tannins on the finish. 200,000 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo
"For $7 this white blend from central Spain does about as well as can be hoped for. Transparent in color, with aromas of children's vitamin and apple, it's nothing special but it is wet, drinkable and tasty. Flavors of green apple and citrus lead to a dry, quick finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Catchy name but the wine is basic. The nose is lightly candied with a bit of green and brine. That pickled character translates to the palate, where flavors of cherry and berry are mildly briney. Finishes similarly, with some reedy heat.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This one takes on an orange tint, and the aromas are akin to chocolate, spice cake and even some baked beans. The palate is quite crisp and healthy, with berry fruit, citrus and length. A good wine with a racy, cleansing feel. It's not spectacular but it ranks highly among similar competitors.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Reddish in color, with raspberry and other high-toned aromas. The palate is fleshy but clean, with good acidity pushing slightly sweet cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes with sugar and a good mouthfeel. Gets the job done.",Spain,Rosé
"Rubber and berry aromas are solid if standard, while the palate has freshness and bounce along with cherry, raspberry and rubbery latex. Slight amounts of heat and bitterness show up on the finish, but overall this is an entirely functional young wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"An unusual wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, Syrah and Merlot. It's floral but underdeveloped, with volatility and stunted fruit. The palate has punch and size but also saucy, herbal flavors and a leathery, salinic finish. Shows flashes but it doesn't dance in the mouth.",Spain,Red Blend
"A consistent wine from year to year that's made in a friendly, mass-appeal style. It's not so pungent and citrusy like some Verdejo; instead it's more peachy, sweet and melony. Soft on the finish but with just enough acidity to get it through the year.",Spain,Verdejo
"A bit murky and damp on the nose, with brandied fruit and raisin aromas. The palate is solidly formed, with basic raspberry flavors but not much follow through as the finish shows buttery, soft flavors. Inoffensive but more generic than individual.",Spain,Red Blend
"Nectarine and citrus aromas are solid, while the palate is more racy, sharp and linear than some, with narrow, semisour flavors of lemon and orange. Decent feel, maybe a little high in acid, and showing a pithy bitterness on the crisp finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Varietal Graciano will never fit into the mold of “tried and true,” but this 2004 from top-level producer Contino shows the grape in its most positive light. The nose is natural, with hints of cola and ripe berries. The feel is brawny and intense, with semi-searing acids offset by ripe tannins. Finishes well, with a cleansing wave of red fruit and citrusy flavors. More of a novelty than anything, but a fine wine in and of itself.",Spain,Graciano
"Past vintages of Imperial Gran Reserva have seemed sharp and dilute; not the 1998, which is resolute in its delivery of cumin, root beer and subtle raspberry aromas. The palate has nice primary cherry and berry flavors, solid tannins and welcome but not overwhelming acidity. Notice a touch of dill and butter on the finish, a reflection of traditional American oak aging.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Smells roasted and stemmy, with a burnt leaf and turned earth quality to the bouquet. Herbal, scratchy berry and plum flavors feel rough and don't exhibit enough freshness. Simply put: it's a leafy, muddled Ribera wine.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Mealy and heavy smelling, but with decent background fruit aromas and sweetness. Frankly, this already seems to be past its prime, evidenced by creamy, flat flavors of bland fruit and caramel. The finish needs snap and crispness but doesn't have any; a bit too sweet, candied and bitter already.",Spain,Rosé
"Heavy and nutty, almost like movie popcorn. In due time the nose transitions to creamy berry and cranberry. The palate is soft and muddled, with some citrus and red apple. Sweet and tomatoey on the finish; needs more focus, acidity and dryness.",Spain,Rosé
"A bit sharp, stemmy and sour smelling. But the fruit flavors are solid and the herbal cherry and plum character that leads the palate improves with airing. Herbal on the finish; standard as a whole.",Spain,Monastrell-Syrah
"This warm-climate Viura hits with plodding barrel aromas and flavors but there's not a lot of high-quality natural material to support that much faux/forced oak. Along the way it hints at mealy apple, spice, cinnamon powder and resin. A lot of noise but not much music.",Spain,Viura
"Candied fruit and punch bowl aromas are not what you'd call sophisticated, and the mouth pretty much follows suit with tart, rubbery raspberry fruit that comes on a bit hot and raw. Tough but with full flavor; sort of like chewing on a plum skin.",Spain,Mencía
"Lean, dry aromas of cherry skins and citrus lead to a competent but basic palate of raspberry and cherry flavors. Everything about this wine screams “regular,” from the tart red fruit core to the tough but fresh mouthfeel to the edgy finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Vivid pink in color, with dusty, easygoing raspberry aromas. The palate is a bit soft and low in acidity, which indicates that this is the year to drink the wine...and as soon as possible. Flavors of cherry and strawberry are regular, if a touch bitter toward the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"By no means is this the best wine from Pedrosa; it has decent red berry aromas, but what you really get is minty, forward oak. The palate has an acidic tang to it that suggests medium ripeness, while flavors of cherry tomatoes, herbs, vanilla and mint take you only so far. More barrel than substance here.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Minty-grassy top aromas indicate that the wine, while endowed with decent berry character, has an herbal side as well. In the mouth, it's hard, lean and compact, with tart cherry/plum flavors and a quick finish. Basic with a touch of sourness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with a blast of hot, basic red fruit that's fiery and a little pickled. The palate is lean and acidic but doesn't burn, while the cherry and red plum flavors are elementary. Inoffensive, highly regular red wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The wines of Abelis Carthago are enigmatic. The lowest-priced Lui is the most balanced and complete. This wine, William, is dark and dense, with shoe polish and raw crude oil on the nose. It's super strapping and tannic, with bitter chocolate and coffee notes carrying the racy palate to a fiery finish. It lacks nuance and subtlety but will augment a good steak with nary a problem.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Caramel, molasses and spice aromas make this a totally approachable and familiar type of Sherry. The palate offers a round but zesty attack, with flavors of caramel, coffee, toffee, baked apple and orange peel. For the most part it's racy and fresh, but finishing mushroom and pepper notes give it added character.",Spain,Sherry
"There's no denying the wine's core strengths, which start with the bouquet's campfire and prune qualities and extend onto the palate, where peppy raspberry and plum flavors take over. This is a complete, stylish Rioja that's about halfway through the aging process. It's still juicy and agile, with licorice and raisin notes adding some sweetness. Drink now–2016.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe, jammy and forward, Prima could become the blueprint for affordable but well-made Toro wines. It's a modern bruiser from a modern, spotless facility, and it offers a clash of wild berry flavors, big-time tannins and powerful acidity. Like most Toro wines, it'll take your cheeks to the cleaners if you don't have meaty foods, cheese or lots of water to go with it. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Mildly horsey on the nose, with alfalfa, reedy fruit and grilled beef aromas. The palate is wet and lean, with good acidity and a dose of heat, while the flavors of cherry tilt toward medicinal and weedy without fully going there. Basic Tempranillo-Cab Sauvignon with a green streak.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Arguably on the heavy and rich side, but if you like chocolate, spice and pretty good pop across the palate, this is recommended. Rugged but not out of whack, with meaty dark-fruit flavors and bitter espresso/pepper on the finish. Should come together nicely over the next two years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This represents Torres' highest effort in Priorat, and it's a success. Perpetual deals freshly laid asphalt, cola and grilled char on the nose and then follows that up with black cherry, cassis and tobacco flavors. It's pure and ripe more than intellectual. Best 2009–2013; 60 cases produced.",Spain,Red Blend
"Heavy aromas of orange marmalade and honey come across as unconvincing. The palate follows suit with bland, soft, chubby cantaloupe and green melon flavors. Finishes soft and dilute; seems like it's already dying in the bottle.",Spain,Verdejo
"Rough and leathery, with roasted black fruit and burnt-leaf aromas. The palate has a clacky, sharp feel and flavors of dried, baked berry fruits and leaves. Hard, roasted and leathery red wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lean raspberry and cherry aromas are the best part because the palate is rather raw and acidic, which causes raspiness and a tough mouthfeel. Flavors are sharp and red fruited, and there's an oak and vanilla element that's not that well integrated.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Expensive for what you get. The nose is a weird mix of salami and sweetness, and the palate is a syrupy, globular blend of cloying oak, caramel syrup and candied banana. Way too much wood and vanilla here, and not nearly enough balance or purity.",Spain,White Blend
"Smells lightly burnt and acrid, with stemmy berry aromas, apricot and match stick. The palate has a flat, creamy feel and stemmy, dry flavors of generic berry and bitterness. Too flat and devoid of fruit to rate higher.",Spain,Rosé
"Sharp, rubbery, stemmy aromas lead to an edgy palate with herbal, burnt, semigreen berry flavors. Finishes green and a bit weedy; acceptable but nothing to get excited over.",Spain,Monastrell
"This catchy named, three-grape blend is a nice wine that's sinewy and leathery; overall it ranks as a natural and controlled reflection of Jumilla. The nose is forward and fiery, while the palate has berry-driven ripeness and plenty of oak. Better with food; the tannins are kind of scratchy with nothing to absorb them.",Spain,Red Blend
"Peach pit, almond skin and other dry, waxy aromas carry the nose on this Macabeo-Xarello-Parellada blend. Flavors of lime and nettle are playful and acid-based, while the finish seems wet and fresh. Overall it is much like a cava without the bubbles.",Spain,White Blend
"Dill and butter aromas announce aging in American oak, while the berry aromas are solid but common. This is a tightly wound wine with black cherry and olive flavors followed by length on the palate. It's not edgy, complex or beguiling, but it is full of fruit and has good balance. Imported by Martín Códax USA.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit charred and hot on the nose, but with some tempering richness finds its way. The mouth is dominated by blackberry flavors with raisin accents, while the finish is a touch oaky and pulpy. Bold and meaty but not endowed with much finesse or variety.",Spain,Red Blend
"Same score as the prior year, and pretty much the same wine. It's dusty and slightly burnt in aromas and flavors, with banana, peach and pithy bitterness extending onto the finish. Mouthfeel is the best part; otherwise it struggles to make the cut.",Spain,White Blend
"Saucy and jammy initially, and then a raisiny quality takes over. Plump and thick in the mouth, but ultra jammy in terms of mouthfeel. Syrupy and raisiny flavors run the game, and in the end it weighs in as an overripe wine from one of the hottest vintages on record.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard and earthy, with black fruit aromas that are big but closed. The palate is short, stocky and blocky, with mammoth but basic flavors that turn rubbery. Not much of a finish to speak of.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Disappointing given Telmo Rodriguez's overall track record. Dehesa Gago 2008 is jumpy, sweaty and stemmy smelling, with weedy, burnt, acrid flavors. Green, hard and bitter on the back end, with a candied sweetness. Try as we might, we can't find the higher level in this Toro red.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fairly green, a bit oxidized and old smelling. The palate is short and choppy, with hard leftover tannins and dry, herbal fruit flavors that push up against vegetal. Sweetness re-enters the picture on the finish, but overall this is too dried up and strained to rate higher.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Briary, herbal aromas bring hints of tomato sauce and burnt leaves to the game, while the palate is fairly innocuous in feel. Flavors of herbal berry fruit and beets are sweet and strained, while the finish hints at green herbs and dried leaves.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Leafy, dry and mature, with baked fruit and aromas of dried oregano and basil flakes. The palate has grating tannins, while the flavors are greenish and herbal, with hints of stewed berries and burnt grass. Grabby and stalky; not sure why this old three-grape blend is still on the market.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Banana and green herb aromas make for a challenging nose. The palate has verve and acidity but its flavors of dull white fruits, melon and peach are jumbled. A clumsy mishmash of a wine; 80% Macabeo (Viura) and 20% Chardonnay.",Spain,White Blend
"Bell pepper, green bean, green tobacco, tomato and herb aromas carry the nose toward an acid-dominated palate of tomato sauce and herbal fruit. Finishes dry and herbal, and a little bit sour. With 25% Cabernet, this is a small step up from Earth's 100% Tempranillo.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Montsant's inherent character is nicely captured in this blend of Carignan, Syrah and Grenache. The bouquet is entirely smooth and inviting, if a bit generic. And the palate delivers ripe berry flavors that don't vary much from the fruity and basic. Call it simple or call it just right for the price; this is a fine red wine with character, balance and ease.",Spain,Red Blend
"Tropical aromas mixed with pear are just right, and overall this Treixadura-Godello-Torrontes blend is ripe and delicious. It's round but zesty, with pear, kiwi and honeydew flavors. It stays on message from front to back, and despite its size and ripeness it keeps everything in balance. Drink now.",Spain,White Blend
"Protos is a venerable RDD label that doesn't try to do too much with its wines. This youngster is tight, polished and deep, with rich, oily aromas and creamy, saturated blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. With spice and depth, it shows how good the 2005 vintage is, even for a big-production joven like this.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sort of strange smelling, with perfume and air freshener aromas to go with dust and cider. The palate is wet but short in flavor and length. The citrus and apple character is shallow, while the finish is pithy. Middling and not as fresh as it probably once was.",Spain,Verdejo
"Raspberry and cherry are the fruit components on this wholly basic, grabby and oaky youngster. The palate is creamy and wood-riddled, with milk chocolate and carob flavors running side by side with basic red berry fruit. A typical RDD joven that is decent but won't turn many heads.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quiet on the nose and only slightly more zesty in the mouth. There's grassy, pithy citrus flavors, a little kick from the wine's acid, and then a pithy, mild-mannered finish. Standard-fare Verdejo.",Spain,Verdejo
"All indigenous grapes are welcomed by our tasting panel, but sometimes they are unknown and little used for a reason. This wine, made from the local Maturana Tinta, is a green, mean, lean wine with herbal aromas and flavors that, let's face it, are vegetal. Tastes tart and short, with a strong, driving green character throughout.",Spain,Maturana
"Dusty, sweet and gummy on the nose, and not very vital. The palate is chunky and dull, with mealy white fruit flavors and a bit of fino sherry or manzanilla. Made from the Malvar grape, and the result is strange and lazy.",Spain,Malvar
"Raisiny and thin smelling at the same time. The palate is dilute, citric and sheering, with tangy red currant and citrus flavors. Acidity keeps it vital but there's little flavor, body and structure. Ends up thin and sour.",Spain,Red Blend
"Smells like mealy fruit and bananas, while the palate is weak in constitution and a bit spritzy in feel. Tastes like bland white fruits with vanilla. Cloying on the finish.",Spain,Malvasia
"There's a reason Airén is used as a base grape for brandy and Sherry wines, and it's because it's not up to table-wine quality, even at the value price point. This wine is corny and lacks freshness. It's dull, wayward and offers little to no structure. Barely drinkable.",Spain,Airen
Smells like fruit juice. Overall it's raisiny and pruney. Drinkable but barely. Doesn't bring clarity or proper balance.,Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard, leathery aromas, with an intense but exceedingly tannic palate. Killer bite and raspy, with bitterness and heat. Has decent black fruit flavor but still it's tough and unrefined.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stemmy, pickled aromas send the fruit component to second fiddle. Tastes, smells and feels like a wine that didn't get fully ripe; the flavors are thin and light, with tea and dilute berry. Finishes same as above.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Crushed vitamins and frothy notes work the nose, while the palate is fairly fresh and clean, with apple as the lead flavor. The body is solid if standard, as is the depth of fruit and overall quality. By now Aria brut is a known entity; always a safe bet. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A perennial Best Buy among cavas. The Segura Viudas Extra Dry is a light, easy taste of lemon-lime and sweet apples. It finishes just crisp enough and with some juiciness. Not overly sugary, although it is pretty sweet. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Peachy and waxy on the nose, with dry lemon and green-melon flavors. This is a small-production wine (1,000 cases total) that leans on core acidity to keep it propped and steady. It's not the most complex game in town, and maybe it's on its way to having seen better days even if 2005 was a benchmark vintage. Limited in its scope of flavors but lively courtesy of an extra boost of acidity.",Spain,Albariño
"Salmon colored, with forward aromas of dust, earth, spice and red fruits. The palate is nicely decorated with cherry notes and brown sugar, while the finish moves quickly from fruit to vanilla and cream soda. Nice but a touch confected.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A touch woody and fiery to start, and then graphite and earthy-leathery aromas come up. The palate is mostly attractive, with solid plum and berry flavors along with tannins that are full but don't fight you. The finish seems a touch hollow and bitter, but overall the wine has good Tempranillo quality.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Citrus, barrel spice and vanilla are the primary aromas on this fresh, slightly watery Chard from Catalonia. The palate is dominated by pineapple and green apple flavors, while the tail end is clean and quiet.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Smooth and simple stuff. It's quite fresh and clean, with more citrus and cherry than what you'd get from a Catalonian Pinot Noir. And that's because this is made entirely from the Trepat grape, which results in a racy, zippy personality. A refreshing cava for fans of leaner, crisper styles.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Time will only help this tough, rough Priorato that isn't offering a whole lot now besides tannin, dark-fruit flavors and searing oak. The flavors are middle-of-the-road in terms of friendliness and complexity, so expect a forward, hard-hitting wine. Should be more revealing in a few years.",Spain,Red Blend
"Browning and maturing, but still showing a ton of life and kick. This traditional-style wine is mildly roasted on the nose, with touches of leather, latex and other firm aromas. The palate is nice, with dry raspberry and cherry flavors finishing with power and length. Solid and respectable, but not something you'd label as special. Drink now–2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"You wouldn't call this wine “clean and polished.” It has some old country brett along with fig, earth, mushroom and liqueur on the nose. That said, it's dishing up heavy servings of chocolate and baked berry pie flavors. A big, bulky wine that's already losing clarity. This won't be for everyone.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Rustic, smoky and deep on the nose, with a creamy body holding up commendable raspberry and plum flavors. Valenciso deals medium-level acids and tannins, with oak-based mocha and chocolate carrying the finish. This wine is so close to reaching the next level, but it doesn't quite get there.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly rooty and warm, with a nose that's one part stewy and malty and another part complex and fruity. In the mouth, vanilla and spice add character to common berry fruit flavors, while the finish is silky and fairly long. Overall this is a nice, handsome wine with balance and character. Expect to be pleased but not blown away.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Very nice for a 2002. The wine is elegant and delivers aromas of violets, minerals and dried fruits. The palate folds in chocolate and spice along with a layer of blackberry flavor. We wouldn't call it superconcentrated or complex, but it's driven, pure and pleasurable. Smells, weighs and tastes a lot like Bordeaux.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ysios is a ripe, smooth wine with polished aromas of black fruit, charred meat and vanilla. The palate has black cherry, plum, bacon and chocolate flavors, and the finish is smoky. Throughout there's a nice grilled character to the wine, which isn't very complicated and isn't likely to improve much with age. Drink now through 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This Albariño grows on you right away. The wine starts out shy and clean, almost as if it were neutral. But as it opens you'll see that citrus, saline and tropical fruit flavors emerge. By the time it's fully unraveled the wine is smooth as glass, comfortable and just right for drinking now.",Spain,Albariño
"Ripe, tropical and laced with pineapple, nectarine, green banana and melon. This is the best Don Olegario we've had in the past three vintages, and that's because it's here in the year after harvest, as it should be. Thus it's fresh, smooth and tight, with hints of petrol, pepper and citrus pith toughening up the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Starts with clean but basic cherry/berry aromas, but with a candied twist. The palate is more lean and sharp than ideal, with zippy red fruit flavors that carry some scour. Lively and peppy, but a little sharp in the long run.",Spain,Garnacha
"Herbal berry fruit aromas are about as typical of Navarran Cabernet Sauvignon as you'll get, which still doesn't make it a great wine. To the contrary, there's a lot of foresty, herbal, tomatoey flavor here, although the acidity and balance are good. Standard fare for the region; 60% Cab and 40% Tempranillo.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo
"Deep and dark, with fruitcake, black fruit and chocolate aromas. The wine has vibrancy and depth, which are the keys to getting the so-called “modern formula” right. Flush and ripe in terms of mouthfeel, with black plum, bitter chocolate and fine coffee flavors on the plump finish. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Very strange from the start. Odd stuff, with a candied, spice-like set of aromas that go straight to sweet, dull gumdrop flavors. Feels o.k. on the palate but tastes and smells weird.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Simple to the point of being boring. Aromas of generic white fruits don't stand out, while the palate is soft and tastes vaguely of kiwi and nectarine. Finishes flat. Similar to the 2007.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"Aromas of mealy melon, pineapple juice and warm radiator dust do nothing to distinguish this Viura-led white. The palate is clipped and tangy, with citrus flavors leading to a pithy, orange-peel finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Excessive green bean, green tobacco and grass on the nose put this into the “challenged” category. The palate is tart and tomatoey, with herbal raspberry flavors and a leafy, green finish. Barely registers on the pleasure meter.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite dilute, with gaseous, chemical aromas that subside with time but never really leave. The palate is dry, mulchy and briney, and dig as you might, there is never much fruit to latch onto. Too thin, even for a cool year like 2007.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stemmy and green, with herbal, earthy aromas. The palate doesn't offer much besides acid, stemmy flavors and herbal notes, and there's a spot of green bitterness to the finish. Not a lot going on here; acceptable at best.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard and oily smelling, with an acrid overtone. The palate is grating and tastes of bitter, pithy citrus, while the finish is equally bitter, with grapefruit pith lasting too long. Expensive for what you get.",Spain,White Blend
"There's a bit of bramble, hard spice and forest fire smoke on the nose, but the palate is largely fresh, with red-fruit flavors such as plum and wild raspberry. The wine is ripe, a bit sweet and solid on the finish. Imported by Altuve Foods and Beverage.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The palate touches both the sweet and sour, as it offers green apple and then candied white fruit flavors. The feel is a touch flat and pithy, but all in all it shows what it should.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Baked apple and spice aromas form a recognizable bouquet, while the palate oozes with grapefruit and tart apple flavors. This is zesty, clean, a little bit lean and fresh. It doesn't offer much in the way of range or complexity, but it's more than serviceable at the price point. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Nothing really sticks out on this perfectly good brut. It offers the basic aromas of green apple and lime, followed by flavors of apple juice, citrus and pineapple. It takes on weight as it opens and then finishes a bit sweet.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fits the mold of traditional Rioja Crianza. The nose has oaky warmth and a slight mulchy quality that probably comes from the hot vintage. But it's holding in there with ripe black cherry and berry flavors that are accented by chocolate, vanilla and cola. Has grabby tannins and is ready to go now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light citrus and a hint of baby powder is about all you get from the neutral nose. And seeing that it's a brut natural wine (meaning no dosage), you sort of expect it to have a clean, dry, tart character. Added notes of peach and green melon point it in the right direction, especially if you're not expecting any surprises along the way.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"From a hot year, this wine adheres to tradition. It's 85% Tempranillo with Mazuelo and Graciano, so it's straight from central casting. The wine offers clean red-fruit flavors that pop across the palate, and the finish is racy and spicy. Not a show-stopper but worth stopping for.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Typical of Navarra, this Cabernet-Tempranillo blend shows a hint of green tobacco and herbal-spicy cherry aromas on the nose. The palate is crisp with cherry and strawberry flavors, while citrus essence and berry skins carry the firm but fresh finish. Streamlined but true to Navarra's style.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Here's a fruity wine that wants to jump out of the glass at you. It's loaded with sweet, candied aromas that are typical of young Garnacha, and the palate is chewy, creamy and bullish with the red-berry flavors. It shows bubble-gum sweetness on the finish, but it's exactly what you'd expect as a whole.",Spain,Garnacha
"Not a great Zemis. It's woody, lemony and doesn't have the flesh, depth or complexity that we've seen before. The oak is heavy and the resulting coffee, burnt toast and charred aromas and flavors are a little too much. 250 cases made.",Spain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Muruve is a label worth watching in Toro. The wines are not as brawny and robust as some, and instead they offer more reserved pleasures. This reserva shows coconut and black plum aromas, with very ripe but structured black fruit flavors. Coffee and vanilla flood the finish, and overall the wine is raring to go now and over the next few years.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Clean and only ever so slightly waxy, with yellow-fruit aromas, mineral and floral scents all coming together. The palate is crisp, zesty and stony, with fresh Golden Delicious apple and tangerine flavors. All in all, the sum is more than satisfying. Drink as soon as possible.",Spain,Albariño
"Typically Navarran in that the nose is green, with herbal aromas along with cherry and heat. The palate has decent weight and feel, but the flavors are rooty and herbal, with a similar finish. Solid but probably more herbal/green than what most people are seeking.",Spain,Red Blend
"A smoky number with vibrant aromas of dried fruits mixed with campfire and molasses. It's integrated and spicy, with cherry, apple-peel and other attractive secondary flavors. With no shortage of power and fine tannins, this wine is approaching its peak and should be good for another five years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Not many wines of this price are pulling legit 90-point scores. But this one deserves it. The wine delivers citrus and piquant green-fruit aromas, which are backed by honeyed melon and lime flavors. The texture is just soft enough to not bite, while the finish is wavy. 10,000 cases made.",Spain,Verdejo
"Lacks freshness; pickled and leathery, with heavy, bruising tannins. Dull, pounding flavors of plum and prune are short and fierce. Rough country wine.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
Seems like it's past its sell-by date. Smells musky and tastes sweet and gummy. Candied papaya and mango is about all you get. Low-pulse stuff.,Spain,Pansa Blanca
"Vanilla wafer aromas leave this taster lost. The longer it airs out, the more weird the wine gets. Milk chocolate, vanilla and marshmallow dominate everything from aromas to feel to flavor to finish. A barrel-fermented rosé from Ribera Del Duero: why?",Spain,Rosé
"Probably not to everyone's liking, but this oak-fermented Verdejo is a bit like Burgundy and/or white Bordeaux. Cured meat, match stick and pineapple-lemon aromas work their way onto the mildly oaky nose, while the palate has a vanilla-based lushness that works well. Rich, opulent and classy. A sincere food wine.",Spain,Verdejo
"Grapefruit, melon, lime and match stick aromas give this Rueda a solid opening. The palate is fruity and a bit green and phenolic, with flavors of green melon, grass, cucumber and tangerine pith. Simple and clean on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"We've tried this nonvintage brut cava for three years running, and it has registered similarly each time. It's a touch flat in terms of feel but the lemon-lime aromas and flavors are solid, if unspectacular. Overall, the wine is fine, with no major faults.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The hefty nose forces out spice and mildly-baked aromas of blackberries, while the palate delivers legitimate berry flavors touched up by accents of dill and butter. The finish is expansive and drying, with solid tannins. This is the best of what's on offer from Bodegas Los Llanos.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A simple, crisp and slightly stripped-back wine. The nose has red fruit, leather and light wood, while the palate races with cranberry and red cherry flavors. Overall it is fairly sheer and drying, but it will accent food without much effort.",Spain,Garnacha
"The nose begins with wheat grass and chopped chive before folding in peach, clover and honey. The palate runs toward melon, pear and green herbs, while the finish is dry, crisp and perfectly solid. As a whole, it's an easy, straightforward, mass-market cava that gets it more right than wrong.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Consistency is apparently not Fransola's calling card. One year it's pungent and green, and then in a warm year like 2006 it's fruity, ripe and sweet, with green apple, pear and tropical fruit flavors making their mark. Seems like Sauvignon Blanc in Catalonia needs ample heat to show the ginger, lime and apple characteristics that make it a likable. In this case, that's mostly what's on display.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Crushed floral aromas, berry-infused tea and cherry candy aromas give this wine a sweet profile. The palate, however, is anything but. It pounds with toasty black fruit, licorice and fiery menthol. The feel is a bit tannic but not terribly harsh, so maybe another three to five years will serve it well.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"The essence of 2005 is captured in this creamy, rich offering that touches up against overripe but pulls back into balance at the last moment. Expect soft tannins, lots of coconutty oak and molasses notes along with a limited but easygoing finish. Drink soon.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A solid wine with mineral, white pepper and waxy fruit aromas. The palate is ripe and bulky, but also acidic enough to be balanced and stylish. Pineapple is the forceful flavor, while the finish is full and slightly oily. Drink this fruity, bigger-framed Albariño now.",Spain,Albariño
"Abelis Carthago's top wine, Fighting Bulls, is also its toughest to enjoy. There's overripeness and barnyard on the nose, and thus the prune, black plum and jammy berry flavors that control the palate are not surprising. Big and forceful for sure, but also choppy and incongruent across the palate.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Ripe and honeyed, but also nicely balanced by flower blossom aromas and acidic zest on the palate. For straightforward apricot and peach flavors, this wine serves its purpose. It's smooth, sweet and easygoing, and overall it's just elegant and lively enough to jostle your palate.",Spain,Moscatel
"Early aromas of wintergreen, pepper and autumn leaves are joined by plum and cherry sweetness on the palate. The wine opens fairly quickly into a bright, juicy, lively package that offers grabby tannins, a touch of coarseness and zest. Should drink well for the next four or five years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's no denying the wine's raisiny ripeness; it's confirmed via Sherry/Port aromas and black plum/baked fruit flavors. But it's not simply a heavyweight on its last legs. To the contrary, the wine delivers a jolt of core intensity and finishing notes of spicy black pepper and licorice. Drink right away.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jané Ventura is known for its sparkling cavas, but this table wine from Xarello, Muscat and the obscure Subirat Parent grape is appealing because it doesn't bite off more than it can chew. There's no oak so what you get is lean, tranparent lemon and lime flavors and a ready mouthfeel. Interesting but not for everyone.",Spain,White Blend
"This vintage seems lighter on its feet than previous versions, but it's still a strange, atypical wine made from Garnacha Blanca and other Priorato white varieties. The bouquet is heavy and dusty, while the palate is thick and woody, with white pepper, peach and melon notes. Pithy bitterness weighs down the finish. Unusual but stirs interest.",Spain,White Blend
"Smooth, savory and spicy, but with enough red-fruit character to ensure that it doesn't taste dull. The palate offers orderly berry and pepper flavors, while it ends with vanilla and a hint of campfire. Juicy and fairly fresh, but a little thin and watery across the palate. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This seems to be an attempt to mock the Moscato d'Asti style from Italy, but it doesn't quite pull it off. The nose is powdery and full of gardenias, but the feel is thick and it doesn't have that clean, ethereal personality that the best Moscatos exhibit. Not a bad wine by any means, and probably best with desserts.",Spain,Moscatel
"Nothing to swoon over but much better than the label's unpalatable 2005 and '06 wines. This has warm, earthy, mulchy aromas of baked fruit and cola, while the palate is a touch burnt to the taste, leaving caramel to mingle with raspberry. Not a bad midlevel wine if you catch it on a good day.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with spice notes of cinnamon and anise before transitioning to fuller cherry and plum flavors. The mouthfeel is warm and fatty, while the finish still holds some buttery notes and tannic grip. Nothing spectacular but not bad for a 1999 wine from Valdepeñas.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Blackberry and bramble work the nose, with a medium-bodied, generously oaked palate to follow. In the mouth, buttery oak leads the way with dark fruit, wood resin and chewiness coming next. Not overly tannic, but short on the finish. Pretty easygoing as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Freshness is in demand as the nose shows dampness, tobacco and wood more than bright fruit. In the mouth, there's oak-driven flavors of vanilla and tobacco accenting basic red fruit. Has a lot of snap and zest but comes off kind of thin and on the mature side. Drink now for best results; its lifespan appears limited.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Almost jolting in how the nose differs from the competition. Here, you get an early blast of rhubarb and wet dog along with herbal strawberry. Never does the wine shed that herbal character, so at all points there's a touch of tobacco, bell pepper and bramble.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Coffee, wood grain and berry fruit combine to create a standard trio of aromas, while the palate is medium in weight, with strawberry, raspberry and vanilla flavors. This wine offers a reasonably good mouthfeel and finishing notes of coconut, dill and vanilla. Good but ordinary. Imported by Dana Importers, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Warm, fruity and full of blackberry aromas as well as touches of citrus peel. The palate is lean and firm in the middle and tannic on the sides, and it's carrying flavors of raspberry and black cherry. This wine has good stuff but it also runs choppy, jagged and rough. Flavorful but lacks finesse. 50,000 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sort of sweet and jammy, but nice overall. The nose is your average young, candied easiness, while the plump berry and plum flavors are pretty much where they should be. Shows juiciness and a spunky mouthfeel, as it was aged only four months in oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fairly dark and chocolaty on the nose, with some vanilla oak notes that help it along. The mouthfeel, however, is a bit choppy and tangy as red fruit and acidity come up and take over the game. Short on the finish, with oak filling any gaps left by the fading fruit. Good and ready to go now. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bigger wine at 14.5%, this offers the full allotment of leather, crude oil, violet petals and cassis. The palate is rich and relaxed, with blackberry, plum and lightly oaked vanilla flavors. It's integrated and smooth, with a touch of wood and caramel well woven into the wine's core fabric. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The importance of a great vintage is evident in this crianza holdover from the lauded 2001 harvest. The wine is loaded with cola, root beer, molasses and leather aromas, while the flavors of earthy cherry, plum and raspberry are subtle and upright, yet still a touch angular. Will go well with food; drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Classic old-school Gran Reserva. The nose is full of barbecue, molasses and dried plum, while the palate has complexities in the form of tobacco, tire rubber and earth. It goes somewhat citrusy and quick on the finish, ending in a wash of orange-infused leather and chocolate. Drink now or hold for another 5 years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark and sultry on the nose, with aromas of burnt toast and raisin that hint at ripeness and some serious oak aging. The wine is juicy yet also a little creamy, with raspberry and plum flavors that are broad and flow nicely across the palate and onto the wide, chewy finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite ripe for a traditional crianza. The bouquet starts out on the stewy side but soon sheds its weight to reveal flavors of blackberry, black cherry and earth. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy due to the wine's mild oak and overall ripeness. Drink now through 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard aromas of matchstick, bramble and tart fruit don't exactly qualify as friendly, while the palate is grabby and tastes of fruit punch and herbal berry. Short and a touch burnt tasting on the finish. Acceptable, as it leaves you wanting more.",Spain,Tempranillo
"After many years of singing the praises of Muga's rosé, this vintage seems lacking and sour. The nose is short and quiet, while the palate delivers lean, citric flavors and a sharp, scouring finish. Whets the whistle, but doesn't put a smile on your face.",Spain,Rosé
"Smells like a dog badly in need of a bath, and alongside those funky aromas there's berry fruit and bubblegum. The palate is forceful and sort of heavy and tannic, with herbal, semitart plum flavors. Bright and lively, but unsophisticated, with poor aromas.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A slightly heavier version of Verdejo, especially given 2007's cool conditions in Rueda. The wine has waxy peach and papaya aromas follwed by apricot, pineapple and mango flavors. It definitely opens on the palate and then finishes with a fleshy texture, additional fruit and even some nuts. Good complexity yet still a forward type of white wine.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dry, smoky and showing a touch of leather, this is a smooth crianza with bright berry flavors, a bit of heft, and well-applied oak that doesn't overwhelm. Black cherry and raspberry flavors are bright, and the vanilla and butter elements are controlled and should subside in due time. Drink now into 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Earthy and mossy initially, with notes of coffee and mocha. The flavors of spiced red fruit are solid and fresh, but the wine comes up short on flesh and feel. In fact, it's quite lean and acidic, which means a food partner is almost mandatory.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cola, root beer and herbal fruit carry the nose into a fairly balanced, old-school palate that features crisp cherry, raspberry and citrus flavors. This is made from Tempranillo and it's a bit like an '80s model cru bourgeois Bordeaux.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A Tempranillo-Garnacha blend that shows fiery aromas and raspberry followed by sweet and granular plum and red berry flavors. If you like juicy, lively, higher-acid wines, then give this a try. It's not bad for the money and ranks as the type of wine you'd get by the glass in Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Opens with scents of pine needle, citrus peel and punch-bowl generic fruit aromas, and it keeps those characteristics on the palate while adding olive and pickle notes. Has good size and texture supporting a mundane flavor profile.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A snappy, jumpy type of wine that delivers aromas of red fruit and spice, but there's something piercing about it, too. The palate is clean and tight, with lots of cranberry/raspberry flavors framed by citrusy notes. Best if you prefer a leaner, shorter, crisper type of red.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Black fruit and olive aromas vie for center stage on the nose, while in the mouth there's black cherry but not much nuance or background. Overall, the wine comes across linear and a bit green. And it's brutally tannic as it transitions from midpalate to finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The muscularity and meatiness of the nose indicate ripeness, while the aromas veer toward drying oak and a bit of raisin. The palate is chunky and dark, with subdued berry flavors front and center. And the weight is up there, especially for a youngster that spent only four months in oak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not sure why an '03 Joven would still be on the market, but since it is we'll review it. The bouquet deals cinnamon and rubber along with basic berry aromas, while the palate is tangy and racy as it pumps cherry and raspberry fruit. Full on the finish but modest in flavor and style. Still seems fresh and ready to go.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Plenty ripe, in fact it's on the edge of raisiny but not quite over the line. The palate runs surprisingly racy with a lot of acidity, yet the flavor profile is short and drying. Shows a flash or two but it's not a complete wine and not worth the high price tag.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Drier and lighter than this winery's Crianzas and reservas, Granate shows rubber and red-fruit aromas and then lean cherry flavors. It's rather chalky and grabby late, and by then some of the thrill is gone.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A very smoky, meaty, heavily oaked style of Ribera Del Duero, and one that never reaches a level where the fruit can escape the oak boundaries. Yes, the palate has berry flavors and snap, but there's also a ton of pepper, vanilla and burnt spices that keep it under wraps. And the bet here is that time will not make it better.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The under-$10 high scorer is fast disappearing, so take a good look at this young, jammy Tempranillo-Shiraz blend that hits nicely with ripe boysenberry and black plum. The Shiraz seems to have darkened the wine, and the mouthfeel is ripe and lush.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Cabernet Sauvignon and Monastrell made in a ripe, high-alcohol style results in monster aromas of shoe polish and black licorice. The palate is a wave of chocolate and candied black fruits that crashes into a heavy, ultraripe finish of prune and pepper. A lunker wine with a sweet smile and a big handshake.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"This wine's nose bears an uncanny similarity to animal crackers, and along the way there's peach and melon aromas. The palate is sweet and slightly punchy, with mango and white raisin flavors. Overall, bank on sweetness and liquidy ripeness from this drink-now Albariño.",Spain,Albariño
"Spicy wood notes and black fruit vie for center stage on the ripe, semimature bouquet. This is more of a traditional Ribera wine, meaning it has textured tannins, notes of tobacco and dill, and leathery, earthy berry fruit flavors. Not at all rough and ready to drink now, but still it should hold into 2009.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean and focused up front, with appealing cola, cherry and plum aromas. If you like wild berry flavors and juicy, borderline aggressive acidity, then Deyo fits your request. It's a fairly rough, spunky wine with finishing notes of espresso and bitter chocolate. Should match well with salty, robust foods.",Spain,Merlot
"Mature and a little waxy on the nose; this is a plump, fruity, semisoft wine with apple, pineapple and melon flavors. It's round and fairly mild, with plenty of taste, width and drinkability. Drink soon before it softens even further.",Spain,Albariño
"Ripe grapefruit aromas take care of the nose, while the palate shows smooth-edged citrus and grapefruit flavors. For a warm-vintage wine, this one is holding in pretty well; it has a plump body but enough liveliness to do what it should with food. Drink now; it's not getting any better.",Spain,Verdejo
"Green and lean Garnacha, with tobacco, celery and other vegetal aromas. Chunky in the mouth, but rather sour tasting, with grassy, green fruit and bite. Not a prime-time player.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dusty, flat and about half oxidized, this is a bland version of Verdejo that isn't unpalatable but lags behind the field. Hits with a thud; very little life to it.",Spain,Verdejo
"Out of balance and lacking freshness on the nose. Baked aromas and old leather scents don't impress, and the palate is saucy and heavy, with tomato paste, cooked plum and green herb flavors.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Torres' Celeste debuted in 2003, and the '05 is the best vintage to date. The wine has penetrating berry and spice aromas and an accent of animal leather. The palate is healthy and polished, with plum, blackberry and herbal notes. Comes together well and should be good in the cellar through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A four-grape blend that's a touch rooty and charred up front, while the palate is brighter and juicier as it gives fresh tomato, savory red berry and spice flavors. The more it opens the more grabby and tannic it gets, so expect some good ol' country grip as it goes down.",Spain,Red Blend
"Light cherry and berry aromas are a bit candied, and the palate is more so. It's almost sugary sweet, but fortunately the wine has good acidity and bounce, so it's not cloying or sticky. Definitely for fans of white Zin and other sweet rosés.",Spain,Grenache
"Sweaty and pickled at first, although airing reveals some hidden dark fruit aromas. The palate is grapy and accented by black plum, yet it finishes salty and cheeky, with grabby tannins. Has it good points but lacks direction and elegance.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dry and spicy on the nose, but also a little cooked smelling. The flavors of this 100% Pinot Noir, but the flavors seem confected as they conjure memories of cherry Coke. The finish is short and leaks flavor, and always does the wine seem a bit strained.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"The bouquet seems nutty and salinic, and overall this extra dry (meaning fairly sweet) focuses on soft and sugary mango and melon flavors. It's not as lively as it needs to be to balance the sweetness, so ultimately the wine comes up a touch flat. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Light but generic aromas of white fruits and white flowers give this wine a happy bouquet. The palate is starting to tip toward fading, but if you get at it soon you'll find perfectly nice peach, melon and citrus flavors setting up a soft, easygoing finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Just a bit mulchy on the nose, which signals that is a wine from the hot 2003 vintage. The palate sits on raisin and mocha, and there's even a creamy, thick feel to it. If you like rich, Porty flavors that border on dessert, it's likable. But be prepared for it to hit with a thud.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Inky dark, with deep berry, sandalwood and sawmill aromas. Color and potency are not lacking in this modern-styled Tempranillo, which hits like a hammer. Feelwise, this is a tough, angular wine that will benefit from another year or two of aging. Now it's very tight and tannic, with piercing acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Castilla y León can be good bargain country, and all of the 2006 Volteo wines are Best Buy qualifiers. This varietal Tempranillo has a clean, fruity nose backed by bright berry flavors built on a floor or two of structure. It's a composed quaffer with pure flavors, adequate length and overall balance.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light, laudable aromas of wood smoke, cherry, raspberry and licorice are inviting, while the palate is firm but on the precipice of sharp. In general everything is nicely put together, and overall this reserva has nice raspberry, black cherry, pastry and chocolate notes. Hold for at least another year.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is made from an obscure grape called Pardina, and what results is a moderately pleasant but soft product. Hailing from hot, dry land in east-central Spain, it's largely dilute and innocuous but at the same time wet, melony and mildly refreshing.",Spain,Pardina
"Saucy dark fruit leads toward a palate that's hard, tight and full of rambunctious cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. The tannins get fiercer as the game runs on, and in the end it's probably too tight and tannic to really enjoy.",Spain,Shiraz-Tempranillo
"At 70% Garnacha and 30% Tempranillo, this hold-over from the sketchy 2002 harvest starts with an odd blend of clove and shaved wood notes, while the palate pushes basic cherry and tangy raspberry flavors.",Spain,Red Blend
"Termanthia is the pinnacle of Tinta de Toro. Aromas of wild blackberry, crude oil, forest floor and truffles are just now showing themselves, while the tight, tannic palate is full of black plum, blackberry and bitter chocolate flavors. Espresso and roast meat notes grace the dark, jam-packed finish, and as a whole this is one bold, boisterous wine. Best in 2011 thru 2013. Only 531 cases.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Nice and familiar, and very much in the sweet, creamy style. There's almond candy and caramel on the palate and then maple syrup on the finish. Soft and sweet throughout, with just enough acidity and complexity to save it from being boring.",Spain,Sherry
"This is Cáceres' bread-and-butter red Rioja, and the '04 is fruity, light and very approachable. The nose shows some cotton candy and other bouncy red-fruit aromas, while the palate is easygoing, fleshy and balanced by a beam of juicy acidity. Along the way, you'll pull out flavors of cherry, raspberry and a finishing note of bitter coffee.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Superripe, such that it's medicinal and pruny. The nose reeks of reduced blueberry and cassis, while the palate is soft, low in acidity and full of ripe, dark raisin, prune and spice cake flavors. If you like a dense wine, this is it. But expect it to be Port-like and on the liqueur-ish side. Drink now.",Spain,Petit Verdot
"A maturing wine with aromas of burnt leaves, dill, leather and shaded black fruit. It opens up on the palate, revealing cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with ancillary vanilla. With medium tannins and moderate acidity, the wine shows no ill effects of the broiling 2003 vintage. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate. It's a holdover from 2005, so drink it while you have it.",Spain,Albariño
"Black licorice, mint and a hint of raisin work the nose. However, the palate on this venerable Ribera wine is a bit jumpy and early on it seems tart and miserly; the upside is that the wine will age for 15 years. To drink now it'll need to go with food. If given plenty of airing or decanting it'll show its best.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The aromas of sarsparilla, tree bark, dried raspberry and cumin take you back to traditional Rioja winemaking. With lighter-weight fruit, herb and tomato leaf flavors, this is a solid old-school wine that will hit the right marks with tapas or roast meats. It's got some tea and tang as well, courtesy of zesty acids.",Spain,Tempranillo
"By the sheer fact that this wine costs $6 and never really goes up in price, it holds onto its tenuous value status via clean tropical aromas and mild flavors of lime, pineapple and citrus. It's a touch hot and burning on the finish, but finish isn't what you're banking on with a wine like this. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Spain,White Blend
"Dusty and peppery aromas alert you to the fact that this will be a lean, tight ride. The palate delivers on the promise, showing tart cherry and raspberry flavors in front of a wave of vanilla on the choppy, acidic finish. Decent fruit and clean, but lean and clipped.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Honeysuckle, talcum powder, melon and tangerine all work the nose, while the palate comes at you sweet and almost sticky. Flavors of white fruits and canned peaches are good if that's your thing, while the finish teeters on cloying but manages to hold the line. For a sweet Parellada-Muscat wine it isn't bad. Imported by Altuve Foods and Beverage.",Spain,White Blend
"Stylistically and individually, this is not what this critic is looking for in Albariño. The wine is moderately but noticeably oaked, and seeing that it dates from 2003, it has aged to the point that there's butterscotch and canned-corn aromas reminiscent of warm-climate Chardonnay. Lots of vanilla and butterscotch work the finish, and the acidity seems forced. Not poorly made but not really what Albariño should be.",Spain,Albariño
"Lots of charred oak and leathery fruit start it out, and then you get runaway berry flavors and screechy, almost grabby tannins. It finally settles and smooths out with airing, but requires too much compromise on the part of the drinker. Has its good points but not enough of them.",Spain,Red Blend
"Transparent in color, with rustic aromas of leather, dried leaves and tea-like berries. The palate is rather thin but refreshing, with red-fruit flavors and a smack of citrus. Might take well to a light chilling.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The average American wine drinker is probably not interested in a three-grape white blend from hot and dry Extremadura, Spain, but in case you are, this wine is neutral on the nose and lean on the palate. Flavors of green apple, pineapple and lemon are scouring and seem designed for fried seafood.",Spain,White Blend
"Dense and dark, with huge black-fruit aromas, toasty oak, chocolate and balsamic notes. Numanthia is ripe, rugged and intense, with in-your-face black fruit, coffee and burnt-toast accents. The feel and finish are deep as a cool well, and smooth as a whistle. Masculine to the max, and pretty close to being ready to drink. Best to hold until the fall or winter. 12,000 cases made.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"An obscure Catalonian wine made from indigenous grapes, this pricey oddball starts with bubblegum and candy aromas mixed with smoke and meat. The color is dark and the wine is a bit rough. But in a country, unusual way it redeems itself with zippy cherry flavors and a fresh, tight mouthfeel. Best with food.",Spain,Red Blend
"Earth, leather and tomato are accents to the dry, lean bouquet. The wine is expectedly juicy and tight, with snappy raspberry and cherry flavors. It shows clean lines and an unbreakable personality; elegant, juicy and firm. Drink now–2009.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty and still fairly fresh, but with that said this wine was certainly more in its prime six or eight months ago. Now it is slick but softening, with peach and citrus flavors doing their thing without much edge or kick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"For a large-production Rioja, this sings the proper notes and shiould please almost anyone with a taste for Spanish red wines. It's violet in color, indicating good ripeness. The nose is concentrated and likable, with solid berry and plum fruit to back it up. Round, pleasant and with a touch of oaky vanilla on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Chardonnay, Muscadet and something known as Pansa Blanca comprise this Catalonian oddball, which is so severely oaked that you have no idea what the grapes might actually taste like. No, it's not badly made, meaning there's mouthfeel, acidity and stages to the wine. But the aromas, flavors and overall package are weird and confusing.",Spain,White Blend
"Bee's wax, roast squash and vanilla are the dominant aromas, and all indicate a fading wine that was borderline overripe to begin with. The flavors are of apple and melon, and the finish is pithy and turns bitter toward the final stages. Not really what we're looking for from Rías Baixas.",Spain,Albariño
"Stewy and sweet on the nose, with clumsy black-fruit flavors. This shows all the rough and tumble characteristics of young Tempranillo: It's hard as nails, with big, forceful tannins and awkward, gummy flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"No matter how you slice it, this wine shows a lot of muddled compost on both the nose and palate. It has decent texture and an adequate mouthfeel, but as you chew on the wine you can't escape the cooked, saucy flavors that point to overripeness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A raisiny wine with hot-weather characteristics throughout. The nose is baked and the palate offers mostly prune and burnt oak. There is a limited scope to the mouthfeel, which remains heavy and deep throughout.",Spain,Garnacha
"From a region where sweet, ripe wines rule, you're not going to get much from this tangy, tart wine dominated by minty aromas and sharp cranberry and raspberry flavors. It's choppy and needling.",Spain,Red Blend
"Baked, stewy and very much in the warm Penedès style. The nose is herbal and green, while tobacco, tomato and other reedy flavors just don't cut it. Mouthfeel and intent are the saving graces; we know this isn't meant to be a green wine but it tastes that way.",Spain,Red Blend
"Cheerful at first, with bubble gum and berry drink mix aromas. The fun pretty much stops there; what follows is astringent berry flavors and a lean, choppy finish. Juicy but lacks sytle and finesse.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark, rubbery and focused on the nose, while the palate is wider, richer and propped up by a band of zesty acidity. The flavors are typical of Toro, meaning dark blackberry and boysenberry. A finish of brandied berries, kirsch and chocolate is almost like dessert.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Astrales has really nailed it the past couple of years, and while the '06 isn't quite as good as 2005, it's still an excellent wine. Blackberry, tobacco and cocoa aromas lead into a stacked flavor profile of boysenberry and plum. And on the finish it expands and brings vanilla and fudge into play. Drink now and over the next six years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A lean and peppery style of Rioja that's very much from the old school. Red fruits such as raspberry and pie cherries steal the palate, giving the wine a tangy sensation and a spicy, almost sharp feel and finish. Very young and fresh right now; it improves with patient airing.",Spain,Tempranillo
This Macabeo (Viura) blend is neutral on the nose but fairly big and bulky on the palate. Flavors of lemon-lime and banana are spritzy at first and then stickier late. The rest of the composition (Macabeo and Parellada) dictates that the flavors will be short; but what's on display is nice and creamy.,Spain,White Blend
"A powerful berry-based wine with no oak is what's on offer. The nose exudes rubber and leather at first, and then comes a wave of rambunctious black fruit. The palate is bright and packed, with ripe plum and cherry flavors. Shows good mouthfeel and chewy tannins. And once again: no oak!",Spain,Tempranillo
"Persistently murky and leafy on the nose, this traditional-style Rioja brings juicier, brighter fruit to the palate along with some tangy, somewhat sharp acids. In the folds, a dash of oak brings vanilla and additional tannin into the picture. Improves with airing.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Here's a wine that manages to blend classic notes of dryness, fine acidity and red fruit with modern weight, ripeness, oak and color. It's not otherwordly but it does pass all the tests. The fruit is fine but regular, while the finish hints at licorice and chocolate. A no-frills winner without a lot of fanfare.",Spain,Tempranillo
"During the harvest last fall winemaker and owner Vicki Pariente said 2007 would be a lean year in Rueda with some great wines. Hers is very pungent and full of nettles, sweat and other cool-climate symptoms. Which doesn't make it a bad wine; just tight, lean and green. If you have liked Dos Victorias Verdejo in the past, stick with it in '07.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dark in color and seemingly packed on the nose, this wine pulls a no-show on the palate. There's really nothing here but acidity and tart currant and wild raspberry flavors. It only gets more astringent with each sip.",Spain,Garnacha
"No way around the fact that this is funky, starchy and full of dry oak and tannins. The nose is rubbery and earthy, while the palate shows some green tobacco and herbal flavors. Gets better with airing, but the pleasure factor remains low.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Disappointing considering the price. There's no good reason to pay $40 for a cava that's cidery and offers hints of vinegar along the way. That said, this is not a cheaply made disaster unworthy of a rating; still, it's austere and hints at sauerkraut.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Purple in tint, with volatile aromas of pickled fruit and rhubarb. The palate feel is wet and dilute, with no real substance. Finishes mildly green, with generic sweetness as an offset.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Austere aromas of wintergreen, lemon peel and cola don't allow for much fruit to escape, and the palate is literally as hard as nails. The mix is Tempranillo, Graciano and Cabernet Sauvignon and it's anything but a mellow ride. Extremely tannic and tough to swallow.",Spain,Red Blend
"The Evo '05 is composed, lively and impressive. The tobacco, coffee, leather and balsamic fruit aromas are lovely, while the berry, plum, herb, chocolate and tobacco flavors are integrated and graceful. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"Solid as can be, with sweet-styled aromas of berry syrup and tire rubber. In the mouth, the wine shows juicy cherry and raspberry flavors in front of a lively finish. Throughout it shows good form and a bit more roughness than the Volteo varietal Tempranillo or the line's Tempranillo-Shiraz blend.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"It's hard to rate an aging, oxidizing, barrel-fermented Verdejo and take into consideration the wine's faded qualities versus its complexities. If you like dried apricots, dehydrated mango slices and fruit jellies, then this will tickle your fancy. Adherents to the school that believes whites should be fresh and palate cleansing should take a pass.",Spain,Verdejo
"This tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors. Roundness and a smooth feel work in the wine's favor, because there's just enough acidity to push the length on the finish. Drink right away.",Spain,Sauvignon
"Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character. The palate is nothing special; there's citrus and pineapple before a medium-long finish. Solid but not the most expressive Albariño out there.",Spain,Albariño
"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.",Spain,Verdejo
"The nose is all dense blackberries, while the palate is deep, flashy and ripe, with flavors of black cherry and blackberry. If you like big, bold wines, then this one should strike you in a good way; it's saturated and dark, with a touch of vanilla and mocha on the finish. Great balance for such a big wine. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A little baked and flat smelling, with licorice and stewed fruit aromas. Sounds kind of dark and heavy, right? But the palate runs to the thin side, with lean but pure raspberry and cherry flavors. Vitality and snap are its virtues; not much depth or character are its fallbacks.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Magenta-tinted and ready to go; that in a nutshell is this easy, no-oak blend of Tempranillo and Grenache. It's fruity to the max, with aromas of boysenberry and black cherry as well as similar flavors. Ripe and easy to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty and neutral on the nose, with a hint of wild flower and mineral to stir interest. The palate is dry despite having some size and plumpness; flavors of apple, peach and papaya are crisp and lean.",Spain,Muscat
"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.",Spain,White Blend
"Oily and pungent, as if the cat were not let out of the house. But airing reveals a wide spectrum of green, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables. There's passion fruit, green pastures and some citrus in this varietally typical Rueda SB.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Cáceres does basic Viura as well as anyone in Spain. Every year this wine shows a confident blend of citrus and mineral, with aromas of citrus fruits and pineapple and flavors of green apple and lime. It's juicy, fresh and amounts to the quintessential summer sipper.",Spain,Viura
"For inexpensive Albariño, Nessa delivers the goods. The nose is flowery and soft, but most of all it's inviting. The palate is easy and light in the middle, and along the edges apricot and citrus flavors are pleasant. Finishes round, with apple and melon notes. Drink right away.",Spain,Albariño
"Cotton candy and warm, dusty aromas give the wine pleasant, semisweet opening aromas. The palate is round and solidly formed, with creamsicle flavors and a bit of brown sugar or treacle. A good wine with just a touch of sweetness in the middle; must be a touch of residual sugar here.",Spain,Rosé
"Over a year ago this wine rated only 86, but bottle age has improved it, and now its condensed nose of black fruit and chocolate mint chip is very pleasing. The palate is ripe and offers blackberry and cured meat, while the finish delivers licorice, pepper and a touch of salami. Proof that wines do change over time, and that sometimes we underrate the youngsters.",Spain,Red Blend
"A forward wine with earthy aromas, leather and a hint of Navarra's herbal essence. The palate is full-bodied and complete, with balanced weight and tannic structure. Flavors of dark berry and black plum are deep and mildly roasted, while the finish is meaty and chocolaty. Chivite Colección 125 is often Navarra's best red wine, and that appears to be the case in 2004.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The excellent 2005 Azul is stout and secure, with a ripe, clean and modern bouquet that's backed up by a chewy, toasty flavor profile that pours on the black fruit and character. With roundness, tannic grip and good acidity, this wine is in perfect balance and is delivering the most it can. Tempranillo, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Interesting and unique blends get bonus points, but in the long run this conglomeration of indigenous grapes from Mallorca is a touch too resiny and bland to really deserve a call out. But for soft melon and pithy flavors, and the fact that it's made from the obscure Prensal and Muscat, we like it well enough.",Spain,White Blend
"A warm vintage (2006) may be causing this wine to expire prematurely, but tasted in 2008 it seems to be losing its drive. The nose has wild flower and melon aromas, while the palate shows simple apricot, pineapple and mango flavors. The tropical notes are here, but the texture is watery and as a whole it doesn't go the extra yard.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Approach this simple Tempranillo with modest expectations and the jammy cherry aromas and flavors will strike you as pure and fresh. Complexity and style are not part of the equation, but an unoaked raspberry character, length and correct balance make it worthy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar. Still, it manages to push tasty apple cider, papaya and other fuller-bodied, less acidic flavors.",Spain,Verdejo
"This wine is clearly shooting for the modern style of Rioja; it's dark as night, soft and meaty. But it also has a lot of gaseous sulfur on the nose and hard tannins. Expect a chewy, broad Rioja that's hedonistic but on the cusp of overripe. Decant before drinking within the next two years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A little rough around the edges, i.e. there's a sharp note to the nose and then lots of barrel char to back that up. There's black fruit, pepper and lots of oak on the palate, which has a full feel and then firm, clamping tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Watermelon, cantaloupe and peach aromas are just as they should be, while the palate is whole, fresh and full of tangerine and nectarine. Compact, defined and complete, with a smooth, light finish. Nothing miraculous but great for summer sipping.",Spain,Rosé
"Coconut and wintergreen aromas announce new oak, and as it opens this somewhat muscular Rioja unveils butter and charred scents. It's full, with good acid-to-tannin balance, and the fruit is forward and ripe. A little bit sweet and chunky in the final analysis, but a nice modern-influenced Rioja on the whole. Drink now through 2009.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Another winner from Emilio Moro. The nose is a touch minty and very spicy, but the black fruit element is there and overall the bouquet sings of integration. Pure, enthralling and big, with monster black fruit flavors, complexity, rich oak and a long, smooth finish. Stylish yet powerful; drink from 2013 through 2020.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Full and boisterous red wine, with a ton of natural ripeness and a high pleasure quotient. We have always liked the Abadal wines, and this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend gets both sides of the Old World/New World argument right. It's loaded with dark berry and earth aromas, which are followed by cola, blackberry and chocolate flavors. An alert, acid-driven wine with enough depth to impress.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"This wine is a “product” in every sense of the word. It's consistent from year to year, and if you know Esmeralda, with its sweet blend of Moscatel and Gewürz, then you know that it delivers simple but pleasant lime, kiwi and cantaloupe flavors with a certain watery freshness.",Spain,Moscatel
"While we'd suggest waiting for the 2007 to hit the market, this softer-styled wine is showing mature melon, tropical fruit and bee's wax aromas in front of mild citrus, lemon and pineapple flavors. It has a medium-weight body and almost a honeyed roundness. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best.",Spain,White Blend
"Matchstick, mushroom and licorice nib aromas add character to this fading but textured wine that struggles to offer peach and nectarine flavors. Expect additional softness with each passing month, and along the way you should only hope to salvage some citrus, white chocolate and melon notes.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dry black cherry and berry fruit shows some early chemical accents, and the wine stays sort of thin and hard all the way to the end. It's peppery and tight, with a simple dark-fruit personality. A little awkward at 14.5%.",Spain,Tempranillo
"It's not easy to find mature Rioja from a great winery and a great year. This is all that; it smells of tobacco, earth and dried fruits. The palate is lively and not dying, while the flavors of cherry, raisin and marzipan are spot on. Compact and long on the finish, indicating that it still has another 10–15 years in it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big and sultry as always, with bacon, smoke, black fruit and a full rack of spices making for a wonderful bouquet. Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. And then comes tobacco and more spice on the finish, which is grabby but understandable because it's so young. Best from 2012 through 2019.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Once again this is a stalwart modern-style Rioja with a mix of floral aromas, licorice, blackberry and coconut. The palate is both lively and subtle, and the flavor profile shows an impressive blend of cherry, plum, cream and cocoa, while the finish is long and smooth. A high-quality wine that should impress. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe, dark, a little oily and totally compelling from an aromatic standpoint. The palate is right where it should be, as neither the tannins nor the acidity are out of whack. Boysenberry, blackberry and plum flavors carry an herbal touch, and the finish is layered, with a lasting impression of coffee.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Purple in color and meaty on the nose, with a hint of raisin and reduction but not too much. Due to the heat of 2003, this is a ripe, rich wine with big plum and berry flavors but also good balance and feel. It covers all the bases and finishes in a smooth, solid, stylish way. Just reaches the cut of excellence.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A bit too much new American oak was thrown at this crianza, leaving minty, drying aromas that veer into the butter and dill range. The palate is largely fresh and balanced, with peppery red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry. A woody encore smothers the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cloudy in color, with tart rhubarb aromas. The palate shows some acidity and tang, with pink grapefruit flavors offering a shrill kick. But overall the wine has seen better days and has become limited in scope at this point.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fiery, hot aromas feature raspberry, burnt leaves, balsamic notes and earth. It's wild and jumpy in the mouth, with rhubarb and cranberry defining the tight, underdeveloped palate, while the finish is tangy and almost peachy. Shows many cool-year characteristics of a 2002.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fresh peach and nectarine dominate the nose on this semisweet blend of Viura and Malvasia. The flavors are mostly melon and citrus, while the finishing touch is that of fruit cocktail. It's a touch sticky in the long run, but at least it isn't cloying or cooked.",Spain,White Blend
"Aromatic notes of talcum powder and scented candles give this Bordeaux blend from Navarra a light, pleasant bouquet. But the palate is more starching and hard than ideal, leaving a spiky, jagged feel to the wine's raspberry and plum fruit. So rugged and jarring that food is downright mandatory. Ripped but punishing.",Spain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Rueda is best when it's fresh and dancing, but this 2006 is showing too many signs of the hot year from which it came. It's already tired and soft, with compost and mealy citrus aromas going head to head with grapefruit and marmalade notes. Tasted in December 2007, this was probably a tastier, fresher wine six months prior.",Spain,Verdejo
"A pure and intense rendition of Priorato. The nose is stacked with minerality, smoke, ink and tough but regal black fruit aromas. It's powerful and concentrated in the mouth, with bold cassis and blackberry flavors in front of a long, flavorful, slightly lemony finish. Needs a few years to show its best; drink from 2011 through 2017.",Spain,Red Blend
"A big-time Priorato with tobacco, minerality and dark fruit aromas in front of a lush and smooth palate full of cola, blackberry and licorice flavors. There's all the power you could ask for but also complexity and layering that set up a minerally finish of mocha and coffee. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Spain,Red Blend
"Take the bubbles out of Cava and this is pretty much what's left. The nose is light, with peach and banana aromas. Tangy flavors of orange and pineapple are lively but lacking, and the finish is ripe but simple. For flush flavors and just enough zap, this is good.",Spain,White Blend
"Oily and citrusy, with pungent, almost nutty aromas that are at once exotic but simultaneously funky and sour. The palate hits with chopping passion fruit and citrus, but there's also some banana to contemplate. In the end, it's just too hard to embrace and go beyond a sip or two, which isn't a great testimonial.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Sweet and chunky, like Hawaiian Punch. This is heavy and unctuous at this stage of evolution, with raspberry and ripe melon flavors. Round and no longer edgy. Wait for the 2007.",Spain,Grenache
"An oaky, awkward, lactic lug that offers a ton of wood grain, funky fruit and a hard, overly spicy mouthfeel. It's trying to do too much with smoke and mirrors; the raw material isn't there.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's no shortage of ripe aromas: leather, berries and aged cheese. Yet the palate is quite sharp, with searing acidity sitting on top of red-berry flavors. This wine has unlimited aging potential, but will it ever taste great? That remains to be seen.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha fruit that leaves a red tint and sweet aromas. The palate has plenty of jump and bounce in its step, while the flavors are both sweet and sour. A little sheer but a good wine with ample character.",Spain,Rosé
"Leafy and peppery on the nose, with light red-fruit aromas and some citrus peel. It runs more lean and spicy than anything, with hints of tomato leaf, fennel and sausage.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"El Coto has gotten its game in gear in recent years. The brand's value-priced wines like this Viura are clean and proper. In this case, opening aromas of stone and lime yield to green fruits and cucumber. The wine is easy and fresh, with a juicy, simple mouthfeel.",Spain,Viura
"Spice, herbs, smoked meat and a dark core work in harmony on the bouquet. The palate on this well-made Reserva packs black cherry, cassis and plum, and that's followed by a stylish, smooth finish that comes on buttery at first and then settles in. Doesn't overwhelm but complements food nicely. Tasted twice.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Very colorful and properly ripe, with lush berry aromas backed by coffee notes. The palate is lush and balanced, with deep blueberry, black cherry and cola notes. A truly committed wine with a smooth, unctuous finish as the final chapter.",Spain,Syrah
"Starts with roasted, leathery aromas that feature hints of burnt beef and berry compote. The palate is layered and nicely balanced, with berry flavors hitting first and chocolate coming next. Espresso is the final act, as it ties the mouth to the finish in impressive fashion. A big load but one that's still manageable.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Really nice and lush, with an aromatic mix of tobacco, baked fruit, mocha, vanilla, shoe polish, earth and more. It displays a ripe, friendly feel and yummy flavors of mocha, chocolate and savory, subtle berry fruits. Layered on the finish, with lasting notes of fig, mocha and blackberry. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite brambly and funky, with a roasted “country” quality that points it toward leather and rubber. An organic wine with 80% Tempranillo and 20% Garnacha; it's sort of tangy and choppy on the palate, with a mix of awkwardly sweet and sour flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Concentrated aromas of mocha, toffee and burnt coffee bound from the glass, followed by flavors of sour red cherry and berry. Sound balance and soft, dusty tannins make this wine easily enjoyable and easy to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"So young and simple that one can only describe this as Albariño Nouveau. It's a bouncy, almost spritzy confection with pineapple, green apple and other thin citrus flavors. There's zero body to it, but it is fresh and snappy.",Spain,Albariño
"Not an expressive Rueda but it sizzles. Despite being young and driving, it's more neutral in flavor and texture than the winery's Verdejo, which is excellent. This wine shows all citrus with light green accents, and with shrimp or Asian foods it'll do well.",Spain,White Blend
"This semisweet blend of Malvasia and Viura is not everyday stuff, but if you have a taste for something sweet and different, give it a try. The nose is floral and waxy, while flavors of honey and ultraripe pineapple are heady and sugary. Not a drop-dead winner but unique and interesting.",Spain,White Blend
"Almond, sherry and banana aromas start it out. The palate is mellow and smooth, with apple and touches of lemon. There's ring and some zing on the finish, but not too much as the wine is beginning to show signs of reaching early maturity. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"Tan in color, with short flashes of apple and spice on the bouquet. The palate has a small level of oxidation, while the mouthfeel benefits from smooth but present acidity. Limited in scope and flavor, but solid for a wine that's beginning to fade.",Spain,Albariño
"Very nice from head to toe. The nose breathes leather, tobacco, berry fruit and spice, while the palate offers evolved, top-tier plum and cherry flavors. Exotic and concentrated, with hints of licorice. Pretty big and rich, but also quite well made.",Spain,Red Blend
"Exemplary Ribera del Duero, given that '02 was not a great year. This wine, however, pours on the richness fans of this region are looking for. The palate is lush and ripe, with deep plum and blackberry flavors supported by mocha and earth shadings. Offers a little bit of everything.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This producer is doing a very good job with its superaffordable, no-dosage cava. The nose is lightly floral, with the accent on apple blossom. The palate is solid and crisp, with appropriate white-fruit flavors. Crisp on the finish, with a lively feel. A pleasurable sipper for sure.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A gem in the semisweet category, with touches of melon and banana on the nose. The palate pours on the sweet apple cider and warm citrus, while the finish is on the mark. This is a generous, no-brainer of a bubbly: Just uncork, pour, sip and smile.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Purple in color, with a sweet, fragrant bouquet featuring mostly plum and strawberry but also a touch of rusticity. Bold and full of cherry-cola flavors, while the feel is downright plush and proper. A very nice (and new to the market) wine from Torres; and there's no knocking its value qualifications.",Spain,Garnacha
"Staunch red fruit aromas are a bit prickly at first, but within a few minutes they settle on mineral, herbs, anise and licorice. The palate has a firm but pure feel, and the tannins aren't too tough at all. Flavors of cassis, cherry cough drop and raisin are deep yet narrow, and just complex enough. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"Another great Tempranillo from Sierra Cantabria? Indeed it is. The nose bleeds cedary, sweet black fruit aromas and coconut, while the palate is pure and layered, with a lush feel and rich flavors of black fruits and chocolate. Long and lasting on the finish, and delicious overall. Approachable now but ageable for at least five years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Thoroughly modern in style, with an oaky nose of campfire, spice, vanilla, sawdust and molten berry. The palate is solid and shows good vital acidity, while the flavors of blackberry are meaty and thorough, with hints of coconut, chocolate and cream. Seems a little more balanced and interesting than FB's richer, softer Selección.",Spain,Red Blend
"Concentrated and sweet, with a baked, raisiny richness that maintains its clarity. The palate is dense but not punishing or tannic. Flavors of blackberry and prune veer toward syrupy, setting up a sweet, generous finish of fig paste and coconut. Modern-styled Rioja done right.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A complete modern Rioja with cola, cassis and smoky aromas. Excellent mouthfeel and toasty black fruit and licorice flavors work well together, and the finish is refined, warm and peppery. Not an overly lush wine but it is generous and loaded with a bit of everything good: body, tannin, acidity, flavor and complexity. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With pretty flower blossom aromas mixed with lemon verbena, the nose on this Albariño is very nice. There's body and weight, but balance, too. Melon, citrus and mineral flavors are clean and satisfying, and the acidity is bright and entirely food-ready.",Spain,Albariño
"Sassy pepper and light rhubarb aromas give this medium-weight crianza a spicy, lean outlook. The palate has tang, vibrant red fruit and mildly grating acidity, while the finish runs zesty and rings about your mouth as it does a spicy fade. A wine for current consumption.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light berry and sugar cookie aromas kick it off, followed by peach pit and nectarine flavors. For a wine that's basic in composition and a little dilute, it's also fresh and held together by good acidity. Straightforward but solid.",Spain,Rosé
"Clean, fresh and simple. Gran Feudo will neither thrill nor disappoint as it delivers adequate citrus, raspberry and rhubarb flavors propelled by choppy, stinging acids. It shows a good attack before breaking up on the finish. A can't-fail rosé for the summer and fall of 2008.",Spain,Rosé
"Waxy and burning on the nose, and then very heavy and sugary on the palate. The orange marmalade and honey flavors are over the top and sticky, while the wine leaves an unctuous, resinous finish. Too much of this 15% Moscatel could cause a headache.",Spain,Moscatel
"With 20% Garnacha, this Navarran Merlot carries a green and lactic streak that makes it a tough go. The palate is gigantic and oversaturated, which makes the whole clumsy and rough.",Spain,Merlot
"This is the type of wine that's giving resurgent Jumilla a positive reputation. The nose is smoky but still loaded with solid fruit, while the palate bubbles over with pure blackberry and plum. It's a Monastrell-dominated blend, but it tastes a lot like Tempranillo, which is only 15% of the blend. Very nice overall.",Spain,Red Blend
"A classic cava from top to bottom. The nose offers familiar baked apple, mineral and saline aromas, while the palate is exceedingly fresh in its delivery of pineapple, apple and nectarine flavors. A fruity yet crisp number that foams up nicely on the palate but doesn't lose its focus or form.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Black fruit, licorice and earth are all aromas of classic Montsant, and together they are easy to enjoy and understand. Ripe black cherry, pepper and an undercurrent of licorice and coffee work the palate, while the finish sports tight acids and smooth tannins. Good now through 2009.",Spain,Red Blend
"A touch heavy, but not nearly as weighty and syrupy as this winery's '03 Excelencia. At 14%, it's a bit raisiny and blustery, but the dark plum and coffee flavors do manage to please. And the finish is full of chocolate and fudge-like residue. Big but fun; ready to be drunk now.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Keeps the Cordon Negro reputation healthy by delivering easygoing lemon-lime aromas and round citrus and apple flavors. As correct as one can ask for, this large-production cava features pure-fruit character and a perfectly good mouthfeel. For the money, we give it the proverbial high-five.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Somontano is not exactly prime real estate among Spanish wine regions, but Blecua, a four-grape blend led by Cabernet Sauvignon, is one of the best wines the region has to offer. Smoke, licorice, rooty cola and lemony oak aromas mix with flavors of blackberry, coffee, cola and roasted meats. It's a bit choppy and hard now, but time will help it along. A classy wine to drink from 2011 through 2016.",Spain,Red Blend
"A rewarding wine that isn't overly pricey or difficult to enjoy. Dark, lightly baked aromas hint at raisin and marshmallow, while the palate has a deep texture and vital acidity. Savory, tea-infused flavors bring pulse and kick, and as a whole it delivers a true reflection of what Ribera del Duero should be.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Earth, rubber, spice, oak and bold berry aromas give this a classic Ribera nose, while the palate is pure and sensual, with shining raspberry, strawberry and plum flavors. Control and poise are on display, and the finish is clean, dry, warm and satisfying. Will be better in two or three years; best from 2012 through 2018.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"This blend of Tempranillo, Merlot, Cabernet and Graciano has a sultry, earthy, almost minerally nose that's backed up by blackberry, cassis and melted brown sugar flavors. Chewy and modern, with a brawny finish that houses baked-fruit notes and a dash of chocolate.",Spain,Red Blend
"A big, ripe and earthy wine, with some baked black fruit and chocolate to the nose. Far more saturated and dense than Siruela's other Ribera wines, but amid the heft there's rich plum and roasted berry flavors and good overall balance. The finish has an herbal tinge.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A mixture of baked fruit, bacon, asphalt and leather aromas is impressive, and so is the bright, composed palate and its flavors of plum, raspberry and tobacco. It's crisp and zesty, which is probably reflective of the cool 2002 vintage, but still it's a very nice wine with depth and dexterity. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Raw and resiny, with no peg for you to hang your hat on. The palate is sharp and short on ripeness, while the finish settles on hot. Just an aggressive wine with little polish. Not worth the price.",Spain,Merlot
"Green, lemony and murky on the nose, this young wine shows that a good vintage in a renowned region doesn't always amount to a good wine. This is a funky, earthy specimen with burnt notes and a grassy aftertaste.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Tired and waxy, with canned fruit aromas and almost no measurable freshness. Tastes both sweet and vegetal. May have been better upon release but now it's flat.",Spain,Albariño
"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",Spain,Albariño
"A forward specimen with lots of oak that settles on cinnamon and wood tannin. Also a touch leafy on the nose, and that's backed by tangy cranberry and acid-driven cherry flavors. Very tight and piercing, which for a 2005 crianza is asking too much.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A crisp, clean, no-frills white wine that pushes citrus more than heft. Mineral and lime aromas set up zesty citrus flavors, and overall it's a scouring but steady rendition that'll do best when served well chilled.",Spain,Viura
"Slightly sweet on the nose, the aromas of baked fruit, cream soda and vanilla are welcoming. Interestingly, the wine is a bit more tart and refined on the palate, where zesty but full apple and pear flavors run the show. Not lean but definitely streamlined and acidic. More of a food wine than a stand-alone sipper.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fairly agile, floral and friendly, with precise peach, nectarine and citrus flavors. With its easy personality and good mouthfeel, this is what you're looking for in a solid, everyday white wine.",Spain,Albariño
"Shows good fruit aromas, moderate depth and a touch of sandalwood on the nose. The palate features ripe blackberry and chocolate, while the feel is cushioned and chewy. Modern in style; just a cut below the 2001.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This rendition of Segura Viudas's off-dry bubbly is nice and yeasty, with plenty of baked apple pie and buttered toast on the nose. The palate is spunky but round, with semi-sweet flavors of apples and ripe nectarines. Shows some complexity and depth on the finish as well as a richness that makes it to all corners of your mouth.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A lot of dill and coconut on the nose, and that dill character remains on the palate and finish. Aside from that, the red-fruit character is zesty and true, while the spice element works well. Imported by Vinamericas Selections.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Typically dry and earthy, with aromas of wet leaves, rubber and cherry drink mix. The palate features tart red fruit floating on a wave of aggressive acids. Some spice on the finish is a decent second act. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A touch chalky, but for the most part it's clean and dry. A bit of roasted corn and baked apple along with lower acidity make it a soft, drink-now kind of wine. Plump and peppery, with some pith and bitterness late. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Spain,Viura
"Adequately smoky and raw, with rubber, cassis and black cherry. A bit unfocused and clumsy, but good in a natural, no-frills kind of way. Finishes easy, with oak and some earthy mushroom. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Initial aromas of tree bark, root beer and leather give way to stronger, obvious oak notes. Very snappy on the palate; in fact, it's downright sharp and acidic in the midpalate. Has its positives but is too racy and shrill in the middle. Imported by Haro Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet and syrupy, but also murky, with aromas of wet dog and moist leaves. Rich on the palate, with thick, stewy flavors of prune and carob. Warm and chocolaty on the finish, but still sort of ponderous and clumsy. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark and crusty aromas of black fruit, wild black truffles, coconut and lemon peel are pure Priorato, while the tight, tannic palate provokes salivation as it delivers firm black cherry, dark plum and citrusy (lemon) flavors. Finishes with coffee and coconut. The definition of a harmonious Priorat red. Drink from 2011 through 2016.",Spain,Red Blend
"Impressive for the way it blends modern richness with authentic aromas and flavors. The nose offers prune, leather, blackberry and fine dried cheese, while the palate is savory and smooth, with chocolaty, round berry fruit flavors and then additional chocolate and toast on the finish. Lively and dense, but not heavy. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The aromas are powerful and just the slightest bit brambly. A little hot and rugged on the palate, but loaded with prime black fruit, pepper and mocha notes. It's a potent wine with meaty blackness and plenty of raw power. With 65,000 cases produced, it's not a “boutique” wine, as evidenced by the friendly price tag.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"The aromas are sweet, while the palate is light and graced by easygoing cherry and raspberry flavors. A little bit pointed and sharp in feel, but good in a citrusy sort of way.",Spain,Garnacha
"Patience is a must to make it through this burly, earthy, almost murky blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon. Early aromas of mulch and coffee morph into black fruit and leather, while initially reduced black cherry and currant flavors take on more character and depth with time. Never does it really shine, but it is a serious wine that has its merits.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"One of my personal favorites among the giant collection of Freixenet cavas is the extra dry, which isn't dry in the least. Just the opposite, it's loaded with sweet apple and apricot aromas along with peach, melon and candied citrus flavors. Best of all, it maintains its poise while never falling toward cloying or sappy.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Robust and dark, with plum and berry aromas that also carry hints of citrus and mineral. Overall this is a balanced specimen; the palate is round and full of bright plum and berry while the feel is moderately deep, somewhat tannic, and medium in acidity. Drink now.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A bit lighter on the nose than many, with notes of raspberry and strawberry. That same character works its way onto the palate, where raspberry and plum flavors are front and center. Fruity and balanced, with a ripe, easy-to-like personality.",Spain,Red Blend
"Hard spices, smoke and tar darken up the berry nose, while the palate is round and solid, with nice berry and plum fruit. The finish delivers a wave of blackened toast, while licorice plays from the second chair. Nicely made and familiar as RDD goes.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Dark in color, with brawny aromas of oak, clove and leather. In the mouth, there's a mix of black plum and cherry but also a streak of bell pepper. Finishes round, spicy, properly tannic and dark, with coffee and a light hint of green.",Spain,Red Blend
"Bulky and a bit stewy, but still balanced enough to earn its positive points. The palate is ripe and sweet, as it oozes with black fruit. Some might call it a touch chunky, but for the most part this blend of Monastrell, Tempranillo and Syrah registers as a highly pleasurable red.",Spain,Red Blend
"Sweet and spicy stuff, with plenty of oak-based coconut and butter on the nose. In the mouth, it's quite saturated and flush, with overt plum, blackberry and wood resin notes. A big, modern wine that's a bit oafish but also rather easy to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light and generally unexpressive, with peach and melon aromas. Basic honeydew and nectarine flavors lead to a waxy, grippy palate that carries some pineapple and banana flavors. Sweet but not overly. Imported by Haro Imports.",Spain,White Blend
"The nose of this Bobal-based red displays soft, candied fruit aromas and something akin to citrus. Light plum and peach flavors carry the short, simple palate. Tastes pretty good but lacks depth and stuffing. Imported by Tasman Imports, Ltd.",Spain,Bobal
"Smoke and rubber aromas along with soy carry the nose. Raspberry and spice, mainly clove, kick in on the palate. Finishes sharp and juicy, with a lot of acidity. Also plenty of drawn out, unflinching wood. Imported by Metrowine Distribution.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Heavily oaked, with aromas of coconut, rubber and fruitcake. Bold tannins warm the palate, which dishes out cherry, currant and plum flavors. A bit too stewy on the whole, but with merits between the cracks. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Deep and dark on the nose, with licorice, cola and prune aromas. The palate is chunky and full, albeit a touch soft. Saturated flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate define it as a rich, modern wine, and the finish is appropriately creamy and stacked with sweetness and depth. A lush blend of Garnacha, Cabernet and two indigenous varieties. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Red Blend
"Opens with earth, tobacco, briar and nutty aromas. This is now aged to its best state, and while there's still some tannic bite, it's at a straightforward, mature place. Flavors of roasted plum and spice are classy, and the finish is reflective of a fine vintage. Drink now or in the near future.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark and dense, with aromas of rich black fruits, grilled meat and a lot of oak. The palate is extracted but it's not the least bit hard or biting. Flavors of Concord grapes and blackberry are sweet, and the finish keeps its fruit. Could it use more minerality and toughness? Maybe, but as is it's very approachable. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Violet and blackberry aromas are an inviting first act, while the palate is lush and fairly deep, with thick blackberry and mildly brambly flavors. Maybe it doesn't reach the penthouse, but as Ribera del Duero goes it more than makes the grade. 45,000 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dark plum aromas are sweetened and softened by oak-based coconut aromas, while the color and weight are deeper and darker than average. The palate is full, ripe, semicushioned but also acidic and vital, with black fruit, mocha and coffee notes. It finishes chocolaty, with a slight herbal note.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Not much different than the basic Sarria rosado, with maybe a touch more concentration and richness. The nose is a bit dusty, with good berry fruit notes and a whiff of cherry blossom. The palate is wet and fresh, with raspberry and plum-skin flavors. Crisp and refreshing.",Spain,Garnacha
"A little bit off balance, with mild compost and earth on the nose giving way to an angular palate with pointed acids along with flavors of zesty berries and red apple skins.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Pinot Noir-based cavas are touchy; sometimes they take on a rough, peppery personality that some might find offputting. This wine does that, but only to an extent. The nose pushes peach pit and campfire aromas, while the palate features dry fruits like papaya and melon, but with cinnamon and pepper shadings. Good mouthfeel and well made, but the flavors and aromas require some getting used to.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Brick colored, with a baked, spicy nose that is true Rioja in that it also pushes Sherry, raisin and cinnamon notes. Fairly dry, acidic and zesty in the mouth, with cherry and cola flavors. Forceful acidity keeps it moving along. Needs food to absorb that acid.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Generally speaking, this wine is nicely balanced and a bit less over the top than most 2003s. The nose shows mint, fresh herbs, graphite and berry aromas. The palate is juicy, not dull or heavy, with black cherry and dark plum flavors. Finishes almost crisp, with a shot of balancing acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Deep in color, falling somewhere between copper and red. The nose is forward as could be, with raspberry and a strong hint of orange blossom. Solid across the palate, with dry berry flavors and a powerful edge of pepper. Based on Pinot Noir; you can taste the essence of that variety at its core.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"With its citrusy nose and well-balanced palate, this is what Best Buy sparklers are all about. Tangerine and orange peel grace the bouquet, while crisp flavors of berries and stone fruits win you over. A bit of strawberry and snap close the deal. Nice stuff.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Begins with cola and root beer aromas before going decidedly stewy. Ultra lemony on the palate, a combination of thin but cooked fruit along with overaggressive oak. Finishes reedy, with tomato notes. A wine with greater intentions that doesn't click. Imported by Frederick Wildman and Sons, Ltd.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sharp and green at first, with cranberry and herbal aromas. Ultrafirm and smoky on the palate, with a hard-cooked flavor profile. Decent tannins and structure, but short on friendliness and depth. Typical base-level Bobal. Imported by Tasman Imports, Ltd.",Spain,Red Blend
"Sharp, with harsh, reduced aromas of tar, rhubarb and molasses. A lot of heavy plum and berry flavors raise hopes, but in the end it's just not that thrilling. Authentic, however. Imported by Table 31 Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Intriguing earthy, leafy aromas as well as a lot of roasted meat and berry fruit to the nose. Any high expectations, however, are lost on the palate, where it's sour and scouring. Yes, there's red cherry and rhubarb for the tart-fruit lovers, but the bet here is that most will find it starched out and not that pleasant to drink. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flat and heavy, with pasty aromas. The palate deals bulky plum flavors, which are followed by black cherry and kirsch. Almost a red wine in its color and weight. Imported by The Marchetti Co.",Spain,Garnacha
"Out of the ordinary, so it's hard to gauge. To enjoy this you have to appreciate the off-dry style that features residual sugar and overt sweetness. In that sense, it's a lot like White Zin. Assuming that's not your bag, it won't score big. Imported by Haro Imports.",Spain,Rosé
"Simple and fruity, with red-cherry and candied aromas. The palate offers pie cherry and raspberry with a streak of acidity running through the center. Finishes light and zesty. Not much to it, but not bad. Imported by Tasman Imports, Ltd.",Spain,Bobal
"Stewy, with aromas of baked beans and cooked fruit. A bit more secure and balanced in the mouth, where plum, cherry and earth notes are heavy but inoffensive. Strives for better balance without really finding it. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The bouquet begins with uncanny aromas of Italian bitters before turning fat and sweet. The palate is thin and stretched out, with flavors of strawberry and citrus zest. Sort of spicy but more stripped down and dull than exciting. Imported by Baron Francois Collection.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Moderate cinnamon spice notes to the nose, with thick, soft apple flavors on the palate. Not the most forward wine, with a leaden mouthfeel. Fails to improve in the glass. Imported by Table 31 Imports.",Spain,Verdejo
"Rosy in color, with simple jammy aromas. Basic strawberry and black cherry flavors are backed by rubbery tannins. Seems cleanly made; just not all that exciting. Imported by Haro Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of warm cedar planks, tobacco and mushroom turn more murky and leafy with air. Quite acidic, which is why the wine is still kicking and screaming. The fruit is slick and racy, while the finish is hot, fiery and bitter like espresso. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The label says it: fermented in barrel. And one sniff delivers the buttery, toasted character of a Burgundy or California Chardonnay. Underneath the oak, there's fine acidity and blazing apple fruit, and once it finishes you get a finely baked aftertaste. An interesting, elevated mix of Treixadura, Godello, Loureira and Albariño.",Spain,White Blend
"The opening of peach, mineral, honey and wild green herbs is alluring, and the palate runs smooth and full, and also a little soft and mature. Banana, papaya and melon flavors are pretty and the finish holds its stature. Not as minerally and tight as some; this wine has sweetness and depth. Drink soon.",Spain,Godello
"A treasure at this price. The nose is impeccably clean, with tropical fruit and honeyed melon aromas. Elegant in the mouth yet there's also just the right acidic pop to liven up the melon, kiwi and apple flavors. A pure, fruity ride. Treixadura, Torrontées, Loureira and Albariño comprise the blend.",Spain,White Blend
"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime. The palate is mostly fresh, though not as lively as it probably was nine months ago, while the flavors of 7Up and peach are refreshing. Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Spain,Albariño
"The “value” label from Condes de Albarei is always a good bet. Oceanic aromas and a spritz of lime make the nose just right, and the lively palate of lemon, melon and banana is charged up. Tight on the finish, with citrus and almond skins, and then a lasting impression of pineapple. Young and raring to go.",Spain,Albariño
Opens with candied berry and salinic aromas. It's tough in its youth and also a little too funky to inspire much confidence for the future. Toughness in tannins; toughness in fruit; quite peppery on the finish. It just isn't that inviting.,Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Light on the nose, with nondistinct but fairly fresh fruit aromas. The palate is tangy and shows a combo of red apple and citrus flavors. Finishes with pink grapefruit pith and cleansing acids.",Spain,Rosé
"With some toast and popcorn to fatten up the standard apple aromas, this is a fairly rich cava, especially given the price. Apple, pear and cinnamon flavors grace the palate, while the finish is persistent beyond expectations. Not overly bubbly but still lively. Strides better than your average quaffer.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"As under-$10 sparklers go, you'd be hard-pressed to find better than this medium-bodied and toasty version from Catalonia's White Castle. The nose is mildly yeasty but basic, while the palate deals juicy apple and white-grape flavors propelled by fresh acidity. Virtuous yet basic. But who's complaining?",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A little bit sweet and doughy, but hardly offputting. Deep flavors of cherry, raspberry and strawberry control the palate, while the finish is chocolaty and long. This is one easy-to-like red; it's not complex but it scores plenty of simple pleasure points.",Spain,Monastrell
"Sweet and fresh smelling, with aromas of lime, pear and peach. The palate is all about citrus, with some spice and mineral thrown in for good measure. Balanced and zesty, like Albariño should be.",Spain,Albariño
"Consistency at a good price is what this textbook cava is all about. The bouquet offers your basic fruit-cocktail aromas, while the palate is sort of plump as it pours on the nectarine and ripe peach flavors. Easygoing, with some weight and roundness.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dry berry aromas and a rubbery, saucy quality lead to gritty cherry and raspberry flavors. Very thin and starching, with potent tannins and astringent acids. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This wine proves that “organic” doesn't automatically translate into great. The nose is leathery and sweet, with red licorice and peanut aromas. Sweet and sugary on the palate, with flavors of beets and fruit roll-up. Hard and reduced on the finish. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A heavy, awkward, rather tasteless blend of Viura and Malvasia. And it's barrel fermented from a hot year. So just imagine the weight. The opposite of a refreshing Spanish white, this is an oily wine with distant notes of dried apricot and vanilla. Imported by Vineyard Brands.",Spain,White Blend
"Leafy and lean, and muddy. The palate is fiery and generic, with sour flavors of red plum and cherry. Table wine on its best day. Imported by Winery Exchange.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Thin, with flavors of cherry skins and lemon juice. Not nearly enough flesh to support the acidity. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Weedy and leafy, with penetrating aromas of rhubarb and burning hayfield. Never finds much fruit or style, as it finishes with a bland, raspy burn. Imported by Prestige Wine Group.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This medium-sweet wine has a lot of issues. First off, it smells like cooked bananas. Next, the palate is like mango cotton candy. Third, the juice itself will take a coat of enamel off your teeth. Need more? Imported by Vineyard Brands.",Spain,White Blend
"Green, grassy aromas precede sour plum and apple-skin flavors. Thin and weak. Not a lot going in its favor. Imported by Winery Exchange.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Heavy and stewy, with sweet molasses aromas but little to no freshness. Flavors of raisins and plums are dark and meaty, but lifeless. Imported by Classical Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A little more herbal, stalky and tomato-influenced than the riper, fresher 2005, but still an elegant, complex wine that shines a positive light on this little-known region at the base of the Pyrenees. Tobacco, tomato leaf, root beer and bouillon flavors set up an herbal, almost Bordeaux-like finish. Layered and structured to boot. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Full and dark, with aromas of bacon, crusty minerality, black fruits and spice. Balanced yet bullish, with integrated tannins and toasty, coffee-infused flavors that go straight to black. Long and showing additional coffee on the finish. Drinkable now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of leather, smoked meats, charred oak and lacquer are not for the weak, while the mouthfeel is firm, deep and just right. Juicy and bright in terms of flavors, with black cherry, vanilla and coconut. Toasty and alert on the finish, but with smacking tannins. Drinkable now and good for another four or five years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"If you catch this wine young and properly chilled, it isn't that bad. It's very sweet and sugary, with candied melon, mango and citrus flavors. Then it gets more tropical on the finish, with ending notes of banana and mango. On the verge of tasting fake but not quite.",Spain,White Blend
"Hot and earthy, with herbal aromas sitting in front of a hard, grabby palate. The flavors show more plum skin and sourness than sweet, ripe juice. Hence the wine is narrow and fairly astringent. On the plus side, it seems natural and typical for what Cariñena produces.",Spain,Red Blend
"Despite a fairly positive bouquet, the mouthfeel is tight and the flavor profile is narrow. Sheer across the palate with hard cherry and mild citrus flavors. There's no shortage of tannin either on this young red.",Spain,Red Blend
"Red fruit is the focus of this zesty, rugged Tempranillo-based wine. The palate is lively and acidic, as plum and berry flavors get lots of boost. The finish is firm and medium in depth, with a stout amount of tannin. Drink now, preferably with food.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Hay, corn and buttered toast are the initial aromas, and soon after the wine settles into a pretty good groove. The palate is pure and sweet, with sticky, ripe fruit flavors that veer toward fruit cocktail and mango but never turn cloying. This wine handles its sugar like a pro.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A wave of pleasant but light cherry, blackberry and sage offers a powerful but not overpowering opening. The palate is juicy and fresh, with controlled cherry and a touch of buttered toast. Round and medium in size on the finish, with solid but correct tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Warm and the slightest bit raisiny, but overall it's a bright, fruity blend of Monastrell and Tempranillo that's tasty and worth every dollar. Flavors of black cherry and vanilla are cuddly, while the finish is long and of medium potency. A treat for those who enjoy fruity, somewhat softer reds.",Spain,Red Blend
"Murky, with barnyard aromas. Bland but sour flavors. Not awful but not that appealing. Imported by Classical Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Very dark and oaky, with lemon, bacon, charcoal and high-toned black fruit aromas. The palate is rich and warm, almost heavy, with intense blackberry, chocolate and figgy flavors. Shows very nice texture and size but also tips toward molten ripeness and heavy sweetness. Drink soon.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A well-made and refreshing wine for the price. The nose is crisp and smells of nettles, grapefruit, cilantro and stony minerals, while the feel is zesty and the flavors bring a mix of green fruits, citrus and tropicality. Stays on point from start to finish. A fine wine for summer sipping.",Spain,Verdejo
"Opens with exotic, earthy aromas and lots of black fruit, but it turns more quiet and timid with airing. The palate shows plenty of bright acidity and some heft and grab, while the flavors of dark berries and plum are accented by light herbal notes and other common Ribera accents like thyme and oregano.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Slightly dusty, spicy and cider-like on the nose, with a tight palate holding nectarine, melon and apple flavors. It's fairly exact in terms of mouthfeel, while the finish is clean and reflects well on the wine. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Old wines are not easy to appreciate, so we'd almost rather have you judge this wine. In our opinion, it's way too sour and lacking in fruit to justify rave reviews. Thirty years of age doesn't seem to have helped it, and what's left is sherried and pruny, yet with sharp acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Rather minty and herbal up front, with grassy, field-like aromas overriding the red fruit that wants to peek through. The palate offers only secondary fruit flavors that turn to cider if given time. Acceptable but doesn't offer much.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Past its prime. The nose is heavy and the palate deals minimal peach flavors. It's wet but losing clarity, with bland apple and pear flavors left on the finish. This is not quite dead but best to wait for 2007.",Spain,Albariño
"The nose kicks up ginger ale and a touch of lime, and that's followed by apple and mild citrus flavors. The mouthfeel is good and the finish crisp, clean and full of vibrant acidity. A perfectly fine and pleasant cava, but nothing out of the ordinary.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Full and fruity as well as dense and structured. Not bad for an inexpensive Spanish red. The palate is fairly smooth but also a tad bit juicy. Chocolate, coffee and a dryness work the palate. Even shows some finesse along the way.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lemon peel and zesty raspberry aromas greet you, and next in line comes a mouthful of sharp red-fruit flavors that are tangy and juicy. This represents the fresh, almost austere side of Tempranillo. It's also similar to most 2002s, which are more lean and tart than average.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Yeasty and round, with aromas of citrus and spent campfire. The palate runs toward peach and cantaloupe with a brown sugar coating. A bit sweet and candied late, yet mouthfilling and pleasant.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Very round and candied, with a ton of vanilla on the nose. It's made in the supersweet style, as if it's supposed to go with wedding cake or caramel bon bons. Yet there's enough balance to keep it on an even keel, which should make it perfect for those raised on candy-sweet wines and their kin. Certainly not to everyone's liking but not a poorly made wine by any means.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Nice on the bouquet, with aromas of licorice, tobacco, earth, mineral and solid berry fruit. The palate is a blend of power and smooth tannins, and the flavors of black fruit tilt toward fleshy, with buttery oak as an accent. A little flat on the finish, with herbal notes, toast and fig spread. Ready to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Initiates with savory, mildly soupy aromas on top of berry fruit. The palate is plump, ripe and balanced, with mocha, coffee and dark, meaty berry flavors. Toasty, dry and very solid on the finish, and convincingly rich as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Miserere offers most of what you'd expect from a high-end Priorat red. The nose features mineral, grilled meat, raisin, berry, cherry and even a citrusy accent. The palate has a full, complete feel and warm flavors of black cherry, licorice and raisin. Very nice but one step short of excellence. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Toasty, earthy, chocolaty and meaty, but not overly fruity or sweet. The palate features solid structure and body, with rooty raspberry, plum, nutmeg and other spice-based flavors. A little rough and short on the finish, with firm tannins. Gets better the longer it sits, so decant or let breathe before pouring.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Baked, roasted and earthy, with a deep palate of plum, berry and spice aromas. We wouldn't label this a complex or complicated wine; what you smell and taste initially is more or less what you get. Spicy and chocolaty on the finish, and satisfying.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Having not seen the Valsacro wines for several years, it's nice to know that they are up to good things. This is a dark wine dominated by aromas of cassis liqueur and earth. It's lively and structured, with layers of toasted berry, chocolate and black pepper flavors. Shows a lot of shadings and trimmings, including creamy oak on the finish. Drink now and over the next two years.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromas of mineral and jammy raspberry are attractive, yet the palate seems a bit metallic and clicky, with hard to penetrate flavors of rooty fruits, vanilla, coconut and cola. Opens with airing to display secondary berry fruit flavors in front of a tough, firm finish. Nice and ripe, and ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"Solid as a rock, with earthy berry and mild herbal aromas. The palate is firm and a touch angular, with sweet raisin, blackberry, candy and chocolate flavors. Long and steady on the finish, with a nice mix of freshness and richness that serves it well. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pickled on the nose, with aromas that hint at white grapes such as Verdejo. This is jumpy and unsettled, with citrus and white grapefruit flavors leaving a tangy burn on the finish. Jangled and sharp.",Spain,Rosé
"Given the high level at which Rioja is running these days, this green wine with aromas of pole beans and tobacco ash just isn't up to standards. Balance and elegance are nowhere to be found.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Meaty and composed, with an earthy nose that carries plenty of dark fruit and minty herbal accents. The palate shows clarity and density, but it's a touch gritty, hard and tannic. Flavors of cola, blackberry and burnt toast are masculine, while the finish is also kind of crusty and dark.",Spain,Garnacha
"Earthy black cherry aromas give this easygoing Rioja an honest and true nose. The palate is almost what you'd call flush, but on the other hand it's snappy and fresh, with commendable black cherry and plum flavors. With a touch of oak and mocha on the finish, it's a complete wine that should come across familiar.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Round up front, with solid fruit aromas mixed with oak and vanilla. In the mouth, it features bold cherry and raspberry flavors supported by zesty acidity and bold tannins. Finishes full, with a lot of oak-driven butter. More than competent.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Deep and secure on the nose, with richness and a strong whiff of fresh leather. The palate is serious as it deals black fruit and spice. Chocolate and rugged tannins carry the hard, almost grabby finish. A power¬ful but approachable blend.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Much more spicy and nuanced than most cavas, whether we're talking rosado or not. This one begins with aromas of black gumdrops and orange drink. The palate echoes the nose as it displays star anise and Sambuca flavors along with distant citrus. A different breed that's both odd and intriguing.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Tight-grained oak on top of slightly herbal fruit gives this wine an Old World bouquet. Juicy cherry, raspberry and olive flavors work the palate, followed by an acidic, drying finish that lasts for quite a while. Lean and zesty; this has definite merits.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Open on the bouquet, with a pleasant spiciness. The flavors veer toward tangy nectarine and apricot, while the snappy finish is long and slightly bitter. Shows good citrus character and plenty of pop. Quite good for a white from central Spain.",Spain,Viura
"This is a perfectly good, fairly dark Garnacha that oozes bacon smoke and blueberry syrup aromas. The palate is mildly zesty due to adequate acidity, while the blackberry flavors carry a certain savory quality along with firm tannins.",Spain,Garnacha
"Round and balanced, with a nice mix of cherry, spice and leather on the bouquet. The palate comes across as totally fresh and zesty, with ample red fruit pumped up by acidity that creates a slight citric character. Racy and crisp wine; nice with chorizo or other basic foods.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet black fruit starts up the engine, and beyond that it mostly tastes like raspberry and plum. Quite big and fruity, with a peppery streak to the finish. Registers full but a bit tough, with some tannic bite.",Spain,Red Blend
"The best new release in the Eguren family's collection of modern Rioja wines is this small-production, 100% Tempranillo. It's a true nuevo classico with proper touches of smoked meat, herbs and sweet black fruits as well as a lush, round mouthfeel that culminates in a mile-long finish. Destined to rock your socks off. Just over 300 cases produced. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"As expected, the wine exhibits a dense black color, with mineral, burnt toast and dark fruit on the bouquet. The flavor profile offers cured meat, leather, graphite and plenty of blackberry, mocha, caramel and coffee. Beautiful modern Rioja. 4,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark as night, and dominated by meaty plum and beef jerky aromas. The palate is huge, with pure fruit, tannin and chocolate pooling at the finish. A new classic in every sense, with stellar balance and complexity. Less than 400 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The bouquet explodes with tobacco, leather, dry oak and waves of berry fruit. In the mouth, the wine sits comfortably on the tongue, with firm tannins offering structure to the bedazzling boysenberry, black cherry and cassis flavors. Long and intoxicating on the finish. It's 90% Tempranillo and 10% Garnacha and Graciano. 650 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rooty smelling, with cola, sarsparilla, spiced meats and leafy berry aromas. The palate is plump and soft but healthy, with round, sweet berry fruit flavors and ample spice. A generous wine that's hefty, broad and ready to drink. Impressive given that its run is 45,000 cases.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An immense, heavily concentrated and sweet wine with aromas of bacon, wood smoke, citrus peel and jammy berry. The palate is rich and unctuous, so much so that it might qualify as syrupy in some circles. The flavors run toward roasted berries, fig paste and chocolate, and all totaled it's bold but a little overripe. Drink now.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Some patience is required to plow through the early aromas of cherry cough drops, bitter chocolate and smoke, but once you make it past that the wine turns decidedly red and fresh. The palate has tang and a citrusy quality, while flavors of zesty red fruits hint at lemon and pie cherry. A high-toned wine that's ready to drink now and over the next five years with lamb or beef.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of apple, fresh hay, pineapple and natural vanilla draw you in, while the palate is lively and fresh, with citrus, pineapple and pithy lemon flavors. Juicy, clean and zesty on the finish, and chiseled in terms of structure and acidity. Very nice Albariño for the price.",Spain,Albariño
"Black as night, with chunky, sweet, candied aromas as well as notes of bacon, shoe polish and cough medicine. This is a classic modern-styled wine with intense roasted berry, herb and exotic spice flavors. Licorine, prune, coffee and oak emerge on the broad finish. Very ripe yet it does a good job of straddling the line between big and overripe.",Spain,Red Blend
"Round, mossy and deep smelling, but austere in the mouth. A berry and plum flavor profile is infused with tomato and herbal notes, while the finish is long, healthy and cleansing. Very sturdy and Navarran in every sense because it blends juicy fruit with cool-climate typicity. Good but not for fans of sweet, bulky, superripe reds.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Pleasant but a little light on the nose, with candied fruit notes. Flavors of green melon, apple and citrus are standard fare and clean, while the feel is fresh and peachy. A balanced and nice wine, but not overly exciting or precise. Drink now with salad or fish.",Spain,Albariño
"Not all of the new wines that we see from up and coming regions like Montsant are good. This one is a lean, burnt and minty offering with an odd baked, nutty character. Not up to standards.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mature for Cariñena, but it's still a hard wine with juniper and other narrow aromas. The palate is almost sour, with tight tannins and noticeable astringency.",Spain,Red Blend
"Modest on the nose, and then very little after that. The flavors are basic lime and citrus, and the feel is tangy and lemony sharp. Generic, with little to no varietal character.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Best on the nose, but sharp and narrow as can be on the palate. Cranberry and sour cherry flavors dominate, while the finish is astringent. No amount of swirling and saving is going help it much.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Red fruit, hints of spice and a touch of herbal essence kick it off. The palate is leafy and drying, with medium-ripe cherry and berry flavors. Quite your basic red table wine, and if that's what you're looking for it's not disappointing.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Heavy, with a lot of oak, which is reflected in both the amber color and the aromas. Flavors of vanilla, lemon drop, banana and wood resin take a moment or two to get used to, but they grow on you. Not a lot of complexity or breadth, but interesting for what it is.",Spain,Viura
"Attractive on the nose, with violet, cherry and a bit of candy. Round and satisfying in the mouth, with full berry flavors and mouthcoating tannins. Not all that nuanced or complex, but good in a dense, hit-me sort of way.",Spain,Merlot
"A touch minty and rustic, but with enough black cherry, marmalade and tannin to make the grade. Jammy, medium in density and solid. A stout, friendly red made for early drinking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Warm and earthy, with a round, ripe nose. The palate is a touch on the sweet, cooked side, but it avoids being stewy or soupy and instead shows ripe black fruit, licorice and smoked meat. Quite soft and low in acid. Drink right away.",Spain,Red Blend
"A sweet, almost punch-bowl nose greets you, followed by mellow apple and tropical fruit flavors. Medium-bodied and generally balanced, with shy but layered flavors and dryness that offers a bit of complexity.",Spain,Verdejo
"Classic in color, and backed by aromatics of lavender, graphite and pure blackberry. This is not overly weighty, as the acidity keeps it pointed and pure. There's a lot of elegance and balance to this wine; a perfect example of how to blend multiple vineyards into one excellent whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Masculine and heady stuff, as leather, espresso, smoked meat, mocha and intense blackberry aromas set the stage for an intense, driven, structured palate that's full of coconut, vanilla bean, cocoa and pure plum and berry. A serious nuevo classico Rioja if there ever was one.",Spain,Tempranillo
"What a superb combination of new oak, leather, mineral, mocha and berry fruit this wine delivers. It's a giant, with a ripped palate of upfront boysenberry and then coffee and vanilla in support. All the power, precision and other attributes of modern Rioja are on display. Best in a few more years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Full and ready, this fabulous wine from Rioja Alavesa sets the bar very high for any of its Vanguardia co-runners. Gloria hits hard with bacon, tire rubber, tobacco and pastry crust aromas, but also pure dark fruit. Then it's wave after wave of boysenberry and crisped brown sugar flavors prior to a finale of heady European chocolate. Need we say more? 750 cases produced; best now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Plant-by-plant fruit selection leads to intensity, concentration and structure. Aro shows gripping tannins and juicy acidity, and overall it reeks of power and precision. At this young stage it seems like it could last forever. In reality, it should be just right in about seven years. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Only a select portion of a prized 30-year-old vineyard gives fruit to the wine named after the Eguren brothers' great grandfather. It's rich, ripe and impeccably balanced, with a brilliant dark-purple tint and an avalanche of finishing toast, chocolate and tannin. Hold until 2009. 330 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"One half of the wine is lush and opulent, the other juicy, fresh and pulsing with the essence of old-vines Rioja fruit. So for every note of molasses, burnt toast, chocolate or baked berry pie, there's a twinge of acidity, a spike of tannin and a dollop of earthy terroir. Tempranillo with 15% Graciano. 500 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly tighter and more complex than previous years, this single-  vineyard wine delivers a ton of spice and herbs on a masculine bouquet and palate. Well-blended acids and tannins allow for it to be drunk now or over the next five to eight years. About 4,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is yet another magnetic example from the Eguren stable that includes El Puntido, San Vicente, Finca El Bosque and the many Sierra Cantabria wines. It's a racy, red-fruit dominated Tempranillo with raspberry, plum and cassis flavors accented by firm, almost blazing acidity. It's definitely tighter and more compact than the more generous, richer 2005 La Nieta. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A nicely made and easy to like kind of young Ribera red with clean, bold blackberry aromas and flavors that fit the wine's big, tannic structure. Composed on the back palate and beefy on the finish. Perfect for grilled meats. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark in color and hefty for an '07, with vanilla, balsam wood and berry aromas. The feel and body here are appropriate, while the flavors of black cherry and plum are snappy, direct, pure and clean. Bold, lively and nice, but nothing too complicated or powerful.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"This is a higher-end blend from Onix, and it offers an earthy, almost compost-like opening with leafy notes of tobacco, coffee grinds, leather and hard cheese. The palate is solidly built, with cheek-blasting berry and coffee flavors. Toasty on the back end, with bitter chocolate. Very big but lacks some precision and purity of aromas and flavors. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Roasted and dark on the nose, with raisin, prune and exotic spice aromas. The palate is chewy and a bit lemony, with sweet baked fruit flavors and a load of chocolaty richness. Mocha and fudge are the key finishing notes, and overall this is a proper yet full-bodied big boy.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Big, bawdy, hard and concentrated, with black fruit and floral aromas. The palate is grabby and fully tannic, while the flavors run toward blackberry, coffee and vanilla. Rich and espresso-like on the finish, with no shortage of oak and richness. Very big at 15% alcohol.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Fruity, minerally and nice, with aromas of pear, apple and pineapple that make you want to take a drink. The palate is juicy and fresh, with slate-driven green apple and citrus flavors. Quick on the finish, with a revisiting of the wine's mineral component.",Spain,Godello
"Berry, earth and a touch of citrus peel make for a good bouquet, while the palate shows structure and lots of verve. The flavor profile of plum, cherry and roasted berry is solid and complete, while the finish is fresh, clean and reaches a proper finale. Call it a well-made but familiar type of old-vines Garnacha.",Spain,Garnacha
"Clean, fresh and layered up front, with peach, cherry and nectarine flavors and then apricot on the finish. The feel is good throughout, with no excess weight or sweetness. An uncomplicated, no-frills rosé, which is what Navarra and Señoría de Sarria do best.",Spain,Grenache
"Interesting blanco from the inland Galician region of Ribeira Sacra. It's Albariño with 15% Godello, and it's ready to drink now. Aromas of pulpy peach and pineapple are nice, while the apple and lime flavors are fairly gentle and flush. Finishes with adequate freshness for an '07, making it a no-qualms type of white wine.",Spain,Albariño
"For the most part this is a full-bodied, full-fruited wine that has what it takes to win people over. The nose is full of cherry, plum, licorice and coconut, while the palate is bright and ripe. It's a bit clumsy and not all that complex, but you can't knock the power and extract.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is a good table wine with sweet, woodsy aromas of sandalwood, clove, cinnamon and earth. The palate turns a bit to the tangy, sharp side. But in a world with so many overripe heavyweights, this edgy, almost racy blend has the right stuff.",Spain,Shiraz-Tempranillo
"Smells a touch green and pasty, and while the wine is deep and dark, there isn't a whole lot of definition or specificity to it. Sweet and heavy in the mouth, with chocolate notes. Creamy on the finish, with minimal flavor. Not bad but doesn't have an identifiable personality.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Round in style, with soft white-fruit and apple blossom aromas. Tastes a touch reduced, as if the lemon, lime and melon flavors had been condensed and amplified. The finish is lively, with citrus and some pithiness. Good but limited.",Spain,Albariño
"Fairly big and muscular, with black fruit, cinnamon and olive notes on the nose. The palate is beefy and deep, with plum and blackberry flavors. With big tannins and a full-bodied personality, this is not a lightweight.",Spain,Merlot
"Some early pickle and sauerkraut aromas were worrisome until they completely disappeared. Left in their wake are flavors of apple juice and peaches, while the mouthfeel registers as solid and full. A little funky and definitely not for everyone, given the wine's overt sweetness and oddities.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Not a complete swing and a miss, but nothing special despite the miniscule production and higher-than-normal price. The color is pale and the nose has some gaps. In the mouth, you get dry soda crackers and white-peach flavors. Finishes with lime and apple. No glaring faults but hollow.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fairly sweet and fruity, with notes of raspberry jam and cotton candy on the bouquet. Feels nice across the palate, with tangy strawberry and red-cherry flavors leading to a fresh, wet, bright finish. A good but pedestrian wine at a reasonable price.",Spain,Garnacha
"A very pretty middle-aged wine that has at least another decade in it. At this point in time, the nose is still showing a lot of black-fruit aromas, while the palate is chewy, meaty and rich as it spreads out with ripe flavors mixed with touches of mushroom, truffle and vanilla. A fine Gran Reserva with equal bits of tradition and modernity showing through.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Beautiful in color as it blends hues of purple and red. The nose is endowed with leather, herbs and cherry, while the full palate houses a delicious range of fruit and wood flavors along with fine tannins and length. It's like a new-school classic with a traditional name and packaging. 1,250 cases made. Good now thru 2016. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose. This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character. Drink now through 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Right away this shows the requisite signs of excellence. The meaty, earthy, leathery, full-fruit nose is just right, and the palate is elevated in how it is infused with pure blackberry and plum as well as chocolate and fine herbs. Finishes with class and kick. Best from 2008–2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Like all young Sierra Cantabria wines made from old vines, this has a purple color that's supported by aromas of coffee, mocha and black fruits. It's half aged in American oak (the other half is French), and it's much more tannic, acidic and structured than the fleshy 2003. A wine with pure flavors and a dynamic structure. Just under 1,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Benjamin Romeo makes nothing but big, idiosyncratic wines. And some are big hits while others may not be your thing. This modern, round, polished blend is creamy and smooth but also loaded with almond, pear, citrus and toast flavors. Certainly there's a strong wood element, but it handles it with aplomb and oozes class. Drink as soon as possible. It won't age much past 2007. Only 25 cases made.",Spain,White Blend
"Robust and sexy, with smoke, leather and pure berry and plum aromas that make for a sensational bouquet. The palate is up to the precedent set by the nose, as the cherry and cola flavors are outright lovely. For what you get, this is almost a value. It shows us what that Muga can do in a great vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Stylish and serious, with polished, fancy oak sitting like royalty atop dark   fruit that is almost pruney. The palate hits with a solid smack of blackberry, while a secondary layer delivers chocolate, mocha and spice. Not quite at the level of the classic 2001 but still excellent.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Floral and lighter bodied, with attractive red fruit aromas and a modicum of exotic spice. The palate is tight, pure and a little sharp and pointed, while the flavors are of flashy, zesty raspberry. A juicy wine that treads lightly rather than with a hammer.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Leafy and spicy, with notes of paprika, tomato, dried leaves and broth. But in the mouth, it's fresh and vital, with good balance and flavors of dried cassis, tobacco and herbs. For an older wine from industrial Valdepeñas it's doing a good job. But now is the time to drink it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smoky and dry, with aromas of tire rubber and mildly herbal, leafy red fruits. The palate has a dry, rugged, scratchy feel while the flavors veer toward baked raspberry, earth notes and coffee. Finishes nicely, with berry fruit at first and then herbal, oaky afternotes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark and very toasty, with espresso, bacon and roasted black fruit aromas. Tight and drying in the mouth, with biting tannins, a lot of oak and finally mildly herbal flavors of blackberry and burnt toast. Hard and dark, but big and boisterous, with a blatant barrel influence.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Leather, tobacco, citrus peel and herbs make for a controlled bouquet that doesn't smack you in the face. The body, however, is tannic and grabby, while the flavors of sweet berry carry a roasted angle and a dash of spice. Chocolaty and spicy on the finish, but again it goes down hard and tannic, which is a drawback.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Very sweet and rich, and probably a little too much so for some folks. Aromas of cassis, berry liqueur and black fruit candy are sweet, sweet, sweet, but after the sugary richness subsides you do get a dark, brooding, mammoth Garnacha with prune, chocolate and baked power. A 15.5% heavyweight to drink before 2011.",Spain,Garnacha
"Cuatro implies four grapes blended together, and the nose on this Tempranillo/Cab/Merlot/Syrah mix is a bit leathery and tight. In the mouth, it's linear and borderline lean, with plum and bramble flavors backstopped by tomato and herb notes. Juicy, intense and solid, but not overly generous or evolved. Typical Somontano red wine.",Spain,Red Blend
"For years this wine was a big-time bargain from Navarra. Now it's not so inexpensive yet the quality is the same. There's common nectarine and raspberry aromas before snappy peach and berry flavors. It's juicy and modest, with crispness and a drying finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Light and modest in aromas, although scents of citrus blossom and nectarine manage to work their way to the top of the bouquet. The palate is smooth and creamy, with flavors of red plum, melon and chocolate. A good wine that won't make you go crazy looking for complexities and depth.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Plump and full of plum and licorice aromas. Weighs in big and a touch sweet, with black cherry and ripe plum flavors. Very soft in the feel department, with a soft finish that's like a cushioned fall. Healthy as a whole, with lively tannins.",Spain,Grenache-Syrah
"This full-bodied, cherry-dominated Garnacha is pretty good considering the price. The nose is a bit raisiny and ripe, while the palate is sweet but balanced. A standard red wine with clarity and no surprises.",Spain,Garnacha
"This Monastrell-based rosado is indicative of the Jumilla region, meaning it's sweet, a bit heavy, and fairly candied in its aromas. Flavors of fleshy raspberry and strawberry are full, while the round finish is neutral. Low in acid; drink right away.",Spain,Rosé
"Sweet and floral, like light berries with crushed flower petals. The palate is not as comforting; it's acidic and bouncy, which fosters good flavors but a jagged, jumpy mouthfeel. You want to like this wine but the feel doesn't make it easy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pretty good for a $6 sparkler, even if the nose has a whiff of rubber band and wet clay to go along with light citrus and cherry aromas. The palate is fruity and carbonated, so you get spritz with your cherry, strawberry and tangerine flavors. Good for sparkling Sangria as well as casual sipping.",Spain,Rosé
"It has taken this bodega a few years to get it right, but in 2004 this blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet is dark and rocking. The nose offers that modern but increasingly familiar blast of bacon, baked fruit pastry and leather, and the palate works its magic with black plum and smoked game flavors. If it were just a touch longer and richer toward the finish it might rank as a nuevo classico.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with black fruit aromas, dry oak and spice. The palate shows an oaky creaminess, sticky tannins and solid berry fruit flavors that are matched and maybe even trumped by buttery oak. A little dry and drawing on the finish, but still a very nice RDD.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"A black wine with aromas of graphite, molten earth and black fruit. The palate is a pounder with strong tannins and blazing acidity, and that creates a mouthfeel with grating intensity and roasted black fruit flavors. Lively late, with herbal notes and a lasting tannic bite. At over 15% alcohol, there's a lot of fire and toughness, so hold for a few more years and hopefully the tannins will soften.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flowery and fresh, with a bit of talc and creaminess to the bouquet. A little soft in the mouth, but still wet and likable. Flavors of lemon-lime and celery are solid, while the finish is dry and peachy. Treixadura, Godello, Loureira and Albariño comprise the grape blend.",Spain,White Blend
"Tropical smelling, with green banana, minerality and firmness to the bouquet. The palate is clean and cleansing, which are two very different things, while the wine tastes of tangy citrus and green melon. Fresh, tropical and uncomplicated. Drink this year.",Spain,Albariño
"Smoky, grapey and spicy on the nose. The palate is full and aggressive in a bring-it-on sort of way. It's a touch heavy and tannic, but it's also pretty long and toasty on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Seems like the brutal heat of 2003 got to this wine in a negative way. The result is a thick, unctuous, syrupy wine with a ton of sweetness but not much balance. The alcohol is listed at 15.5%, and it seems bigger. Very much a heavyweight, and with no agility.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Apple and peach define the bouquet, but where's the pop? This cava seems a touch quiet and reticent. It's drying, with flavors of apple, white corn and soda cracker. But the bead is weak and the overall personality is shy. Has 15% Chardonnay in addition to the traditional cava three-pack of Macabeo, Parellada and Xarello.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Sweet cherry and berry aromas are blended with cookie dough scents to create a simple, easy bouquet. The palate is a bit lean, with tight red-fruit flavors and a blast of citrus essence. Shows some kick and tannins at its core.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Slightly amber in color, with pastry, peach and pear aromas. The palate is tangy, with flavors of green apple along with some bitterness. Finishes light and dry, with zest and freshness. Simple yet solid.",Spain,White Blend
"With its spice and fig aromas, this registers as a rich, mature Rioja reserva. The palate runs toward sweet plums and blackberry, while the finish is mildly toasty and full, with coffee as the lasting flavor. This has many good qualities, not the least of which is balance and a touch of citrus peel. Best now–2010. 525 cases produced.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A sweet, ripe, jammy style for Roda I, with smooth tannins, corpulence and more than adequate minerality and power. This is not a flabby wine despite the heat of the vintage, and the lush cassis, blackberry and mocha notes come together on the back palate and finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Thick, brooding and aromatically mature, this delivers heft, grab and balance. It has developed black-fruit flavors followed by a cushioned, soft finish. Drink now and over the next several years as the 2001 gets better and the promising but not yet released 2004 begins to settle. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"You're going to like this masculine, well-oaked blend of 80% Tempranillo with 10% each Graciano and Garnacha. It's got modern touches but a lot of tradition as well. The wine is rich and round, with tobacco, coffee, chocolate and earth creating depth and character. With fine mouthfeel and a solid finish, you can drink now or hold a few more years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This seems eminently ageworthy; it has the strong foundation and pulsing acidity required of a true cellar dweller. The raspberry and plum fruit have a beam of acidity and the tannins are not shy. Shows all the hallmarks of a fine modern Rioja: power, purity and balance. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A dense wine from the start, and each subsequent whiff of the oaky but vital nose is convincing. The palate here is exemplary, especially for an '02; there's dark berry and plum flavors backed by notes of black licorice and pepper. An exceedingly nice wine with a textbook mix of tannins, flesh and acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Minerality is a major player in this peachy white blend that throws off some salinity and pool water on the nose. The palate has a round balance to it, while the flavors of lemon-lime, pineapple and mango get it done. Fresh and melony on the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Colorful and fresh, with a bit of latex/Band-Aid on the nose to go with bacon, raspberry and oak-based maple aromas. The feel is stout and chewy, while flavors of cassis, cherry and chocolate work well together. An oaky customer but a good and tasty one. Drink now and over the next two years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly earthy and herbal, as Somontano reds are prone to be, with a gritty mouthfeel and sweet black fruit flavors that come with proper herbal accents. Tastes roasted and toasty, with pepper and heat on the lusty finish. Balanced and good; drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"Clean, solid aromas of black cherry and berry are just what you want from Spanish Monastrell, and while this isn't the most unique or original wine, it sure is tasty, balanced and pleasing. Flavors of lightly baked black fruits are lush, while the finish is medium-long and easygoing. Hard to find anything wrong with this affordable red from Alicante.",Spain,Monastrell
"From Freixenet, this is perfectly good yet familiar, which for $15 is about as good as we can expect. The palate is juicy and also smooth, with red berry, tomato and herbal flavors. There's good depth and balance throughout, and the finish rounds into form and closes things out in a tasty, subdued fashion.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A solid, earthy style of Navarran red wine, with plum, berry and meaty aromas. The palate is forward, with solid flavors of tobacco, plum, tomato and leather. More fruity than herbal, with heat, thyme, mocha and coffee on the finish. Tastes like something from the Old World. Not currently imported.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dried fruit, a touch of compost and then bold coffee and mocha aromas give the wine a decent nose, and the palate, while zesty and snappy, is endowed with pretty good raspberry, cherry and strawberry flavors. Overall it's fruity and ready to drink but fairly ordinary, and while we like the wine we can't say it's a knockout.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Round and sweet up front, with aromas of candied berries. More alert and red-fruit dominated on the palate, with snappy acidity keeping it well propped up. Finishes with bright acidity and modest tannins. Straight-ahead red wine with crispness.",Spain,Shiraz
"Black raspberry and raisin control the bouquet on this carbonically macerated wine from inland Valencia. Lively plum and black cherry work the rubbery, mildly tannic palate, while the finish is leisurely enough. A touch narrow in flavor but broad in feel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Albariño is not known for its aging potential, and this wine already seems to be on the way out. The nose veers toward apricot and cider, as does the palate. Finishes with a final kick of acidity. Drink soon, or wait for the 2005.",Spain,Albariño
"Jammy and full of raisin, stewed berries and leather. Calling it ultraripe might be an understatement because it's nearly over the top in its heft, extract and tannin level. A high-production bruiser that has tons of power but very little precision.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Hits with force as well as notes of raisin and Sherry. No doubt this comes from a hot vintage, evidenced by the prune, brandied cherry and chocolate flavors. Still there's some tannin to keep it moving ahead. Overall, however, it's pretty heavy and condensed.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mildly floral and tropical at first, but then it seems to go heavy and flat on the bouquet the longer it sits. Look for decent grapefruit and tangerine flavors on a healthy but rudimentary cassis.",Spain,White Blend
"The color is an odd orange, which should come as an indicator that not all is right with this wine. The bouquet starts with dust on a warming radiator, and there's some vanilla as well. Soft citrus and nectarine flavors work the palate, followed by a round but somewhat mushy finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Broad-shouldered and muscled-up, this hearty wine seems more youthful than it is. The nose is spicy and full of lively berry aromas, while the palate is laced with red cherry, raspberry and vanilla. It's a classic gran reserva with dried qualities and spice. It's right on the money.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bramble, cherry cola and snappy red berry aromas announce this as a secure, snappy wine. The flavor profile is round, genial and nicely balanced between plum and berry and vanilla/mocha notes. Like most Sierra Cantabria reds, this touches all the bases and should elicit a smile of satisfaction.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark berry, spice cake, savory leather and roasted meat aromas give this a deep, brooding, heavy exterior. The mouth has acceptable acidic kick for Toro, while the flavors are saucy and meaty, with licorice and earth notes. Not overly fruity or lively; it's more meaty and thick.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"The nose of red fruits comes with oak, mocha and toast, while the palate is crisp and tight, with juicy, dry red berry flavors and backgroud notes of chocolate and spice. Seems like an Old World throwback due to its leaner body and an emphasis on dry spice and acid-driven red fruit.",Spain,Tempranillo
"More tan in color than the usual light yellow, with true aromas of flower blossoms, lemon and tropical fruits. The acidity is a bit pronounced and scouring, but that only means that the citrus and green apple flavors cut and cleanse. Juicy but modest when it comes to depth of flavor. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"A bit rubbery and earthy, with compost, smoky bacon and black fruit aromas. Nicely balanced with a good mouthfeel, and showing solid berry and plum flavors. Peppery on the finish, with some roasted overtones. Perfectly good for a tough vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This five-grape blend is based on Treixadura but also includes Albariño, Loureira, Lado and Torrontès. The grapes were picked well into October, so the richness and alcohol are up there. Still, the flowery aromas are alluring and the flavors of mango, pear and apple are clean despite some oak aging. Only 50 cases imported into the States.",Spain,White Blend
"Gets going with earthy, lightly leathery aromas of red fruits, and that bouquet is backed by lively raspberry, plum and fresh-tomato flavors. It's not narrow, but it's hardly broad either. Finishes with a lively herbal note.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Look for the wine wrapped in banana-yellow paper, and you'll likely be surprised and pleased by its ripe, clean aromas and easygoing plum and cherry flavors. It's medium-bodied and nice on the palate, with a smooth, nonprobing finish. It's 75% Garnacha and 25% Tempranillo done well.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark, balsamic aromas blend with hints of wood, bramble and briar to give this wine rusticity, while the palate is slick and medium in weight, with black-fruit and tea-like flavors. It's a little narrow on the finish, but there's also a creamy, oak-driven vanilla flavor that softens things up. A good wine that's 70% Tempranillo and 30% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Smells like cherries and fruit punch. The palate is snappy and simple, with red fruit front and center. Shows a tiny bit of wood on the finish, but overall it's a tart, lean wine that grabs at the palate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Brawny plum and blackberry aromas feature notes of bacon, rubber and leather, all of which lead you to expect big, ripe flavors. But the news is, those flavors aren't anywhere to be found. The profile is tangy and lean, with sharp berry notes. Quick and simple on the finish, with aggressive acidity and tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A wine searching for an identity. The nose deals menthol, licorice, grilled meat and molasses but little-to-no bright fruit. That heaviness transfers to the mouth, where marinated, baked flavors mix with green tomato. Fails to impress.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Functional and fruity, with big aromas of plum and berry on the slightly foxy nose. Fully tannic across the palate, so it feels kind of hard. The big berry flavors are loud and basic.",Spain,Merlot
Light raspberry and strawberry aromas lead into snappy berry flavors. The feel is almost astringent; call it tangy and tight. Juicy but also rubbery. Shows both positives and negatives.,Spain,Tempranillo
"Far more lean, raw and rough than ideal, with a touch of burnt field on the nose. The palate keeps that raw, reedy taste, which is smoothed out by softening oak notes. Better on the finish than up front.",Spain,Red Blend
"It has been a few years since 2001 was a current vintage, and while Montsant wines can age, this one doesn't seem to be going anywhere in particular. The nose is overdone with heavy mint, menthol and cinnamon-driven oak, while the palate is jumpy and tannic. Not a cheap wine, but also not that great.",Spain,Red Blend
"Earthy fruit aromas, blackberry and cola flavors and a soft, saturated finish all add up to a flush wine typical of La Mancha, where elegance is fleeting. And while this fruit-filled middleweight isn't off, it's not that alluring either.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This wine is Cáceres' attempt at a modern (yet for the masses) Rioja, and frankly it's not working. The bouquet is nothing but an avalanche of coconut and butter, which stems from the barrel regimen the wine goes through. And the palate is loud, chunky and clumsy. Yes, there's big fruit and bulk; but it's grabby, oversized and overoaked.",Spain,Tempranillo
"After a couple of vintages of really raving about this Merlot, the '02, from a cool, wet vintage, just isn't that great. The nose is dominated by rhubarb and sharpness, while the palate offers peppery flavors and a rough feel. Plenty of olive on the finish brings ripeness into question.",Spain,Merlot
"Dark mineral, toasted French oak and black fruit carry the nose. This is a sturdy, nicely made high-end Rioja, but due to the heat of the year its range of flavors is narrow as it settles on baked plum and molasses. Medium long on the finish, with a lasting taste of chocolate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"For a value-priced wine this scores well. The nose offers a nice mix of earth, warmth and berry fruit, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of zesty berry. Composed on the finish, which is also fresh and lively. Perfect for by-the-glass or casual consumption.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Chiseled aromas of lemon-lime and spring flowers are lean but clean, and that pretty much describes this blend of Treixadura, Torrontés and Palomino. Lime and green banana are the key flavors, and the finish brings back lemon-lime and minerality. More basic than flashy, but nice in a neutral way.",Spain,White Blend
"The packaging and name are a little contrived, but what's in the bottle stands up to scrutiny. The aromas are warm and plummy, with a hint of toast and cream. The palate is clean and juicy, with snappy black raspberry fruit and a fruity carry-over onto the finish. Spunky, fresh and pleasant.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The sweet, rubbery nose deals earth, herbs, smoked meat and richness, while the palate is candied and big, with sweet, medicinal flavors of blackberry and black cherry. A touch lactic on the finish, but otherwise the wine is alert and ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mildly pickled and stemmy at first, with earthy compost aromas that fade and are replaced by raspberry and other berry fruit scents. The palate has snap and smacking tannins, with flavors of raspberry, cherry and a staunch buttery dryness. Brambly but with enough good fruit and body to make the cut.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A clean, easygoing style of Albariño with salinic aromas along with apple and peach. The palate has a perfectly good feel to it, while the flavors of citrus and peach are a little plump and sweet. Finishes with tropical notes and pithy white grapefruit.",Spain,Albariño
"A mature, more traditional Spanish wine that's ready to drink. The nose mixes tomato leaf, mint and maturing berry aromas, while the starchy, grabby palate shows aging raspberry and strawberry fruit with ample leather and dryness. Caramel, vanilla and toast notes grace the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Roasted berry, marzipan, prune, spice and earth are rolled into a solid whole on the bouquet, while the palate rides on the heavy side with grating tannins and deep but clumsy flavors of blackberry, raisin and fruitcake. Smooth but not complex or demanding. Chewy and bulky, which isn't uncommon for Toro.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Palacios started his Valdeorras winery in 2004, and in short order he has established himself as a quality leader. His As Sortes is 100% Godello, from dry-farmed vines with age. This wine is rich, with ample oak, fresh and dry fruit flavors, and a walnut-infused finish. Quite Burgundian in style.",Spain,Godello
"Pezas is the Meursault of Valdeorras. It starts with a smoky, slate-driven nose and then opens to reveal pear, green apple and vanilla flavors. Shows excellent backbone courtesy of refined but powerful acidity. One of Galicia's few ageworthy whites; good through at least 2008.",Spain,White Blend
"From extremely old Godello vines, this barrel-fermented wine comes only in magnums. It's currently showing a lot of oak, but it's also extremely well structured. It has an acid backbone that nobody could crack. Very serious, with intense apple, pear and minerality. Much like a fine Burgundy.",Spain,Godello
"Put this Spanish rosado in the summer rotation. The nose gives you raspberry and strawberry aromas in light, airy form but avoids the candied side of the rosé spectrum. Pink grapefruit and nectarine flavors give it a fresh, clean, Mediterranean style.",Spain,Rosé
"Bold in color, with a stewy nose that oozes raisin and licorice. The palate is heavy, with bacon and reduced berry flavors. Flat and a touch burnt late, and in general it's in dire need of an infusion of acidity.",Spain,Syrah
"The bouquet mixes bramble and berry notes, which turn rougher and more vegetal as time passes. The palate is peppery and light, with just adequate cherry and berry flavors. A light, distant wine with some similarities to Beaujolais Nouveau.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Soft aromatically, with notes of pear, vanilla and banana. Surprisingly, the palate is short and tart, with sharp citrus and pineapple flavors. Entirely basic and lacking punch. Already seems to be in decline and it's brand new.",Spain,Albariño
"Light melon and vanilla aromas are simple yet muddled, while the green melon and lemon flavors are not overly generous but acceptable. A narrow wine with a lean figure and protruding acidity.",Spain,Verdejo
"Woodsy and smoky up front, which sort of hides the fact that there's very little fruit on the bones of this wine. On the palate, it's peppery and firm, with spiky tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Short and slightly chemical on the nose, with hard-to-define melon, citrus and apple flavors. A tart wine without too much going on.",Spain,White Blend
"Light reddish in color, with dry cranberry aromas and a strong hint of spearmint. Surprisingly heavy in the mouth, with slightly cooked flavors and a wave of burnt brown sugar on the finish. A wine with some issues.",Spain,Garnacha
"This Navarran winery usually does well, but its '02 Crianza isn't up to snuff. The nose is clumsy and jammy, while the fruit is underdeveloped and dull. Acceptable on its best day.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Stylish and alluring nose; quite sexy. The malolactic fermentation took place in barrel, so the wine has mouthfeel and richness. Yet it's a juicy, friendly, fruit-forward style of Tempranillo, one that finishes with mocha and wood-driven spice notes. 20,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy and fully ripe, with classic Rioja aromas of sweet leather, herbs and a touch of raisin. But once you get it onto the palate you'll be impressed with the roundness of the body and the depth of the cola, cherry and plum flavors. Finishes with cocoa, buttered toast and width. Drink now through 2008.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Plenty of white flowers and tropical-fruit aromas signal that this is special. The palate is full to the brim with pure flavors of melon, nectarine and green herbs, while the finish is exact. Drinking this baby is like taking a trip to the heart of Salnés.",Spain,Albariño
"Round, fruity and quite exceptional in its class. This Verdejo sets the standard for Rueda; it's loaded with green melon and pineapple up front and backed by bright apple, pear and green herb flavors. Perfectly balanced and fresh. Stands out from the crowd.",Spain,Verdejo
"Treixadura-based, with Godello, Loureira and tiny portions of Albariño, Torrontes, Caino Blanca and Albilla. The whole, however, is all that counts, and this is simply an excellent white that's aromatic, dry as a bone, and fresh as spring.",Spain,White Blend
"A recommended entry-level Ribera, with aromas of violets, minerals and oak. The palate has a standard, competent feel and balance along with flavors of gangly berry fruit and black cherry. Mocha and vanilla help sweeten and soften up the finish, but overall it's a regular, fresh type of wine.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Aromas of black fruits, light oak and violets are good but basic, and that pretty much defines the rest of the wine. Expect an easy flowing palate with candied, regular berry flavors in front of a light to medium finish. Nicely done and approachable.",Spain,Monastrell
"A jammy, fruity, extracted Tempranillo with simple, candied berry aromas followed by a heavy, bulky palate that's packed with warm berry fruit. A rich, young, jumpy sweetie that's designed to make you happy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice and prickly, with aromas of nettles, citrus and minerals. The palate is fresh and acidic, while the flavors of green apple, scallion, pineapple, lemon and grapefruit come together well. Clean and not overly acidic on the finish. Varietally speaking, this is on the money.",Spain,Verdejo
"A full-bodied red blend from Montsant. The nose is big and smells of black cherry, licorice and herbal, foresty notes, while the palate is saturated and grabby at the edges, with herb-tinged, roasted-berry flavors. Snappy and cheek-starching on the finish; drink now through 2011.",Spain,Red Blend
"Starts out sort of jumbled, with heavy aromas, deep fruit scents and a shot of leather or animal hide. The palate is healthy, however, with proper acidity pushing earthy plum and berry flavors. Shows good structure and ample size and mouthfeel. The blend is 75% Garnacha and 25% Graciano.",Spain,Red Blend
"Brambly red fruit, leather and a strong whiff of dill pickle create a less than welcoming nose, which is backed by tart red fruit that carries a roasted overtone. Oaky and tomatoey throughout, with a lean mouthfeel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lean and peppery, with more citrus than berry on the nose. The mouth is a bit grabby, with a starchy feel and far-reaching tannins. Clearly not a great wine but it holds itself together.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard and jumbled up front, with slightly harsh peppery notes interlocking with light raspberry fruit. A light, airy, almost innocuous wine with mild bitterness on the finish. Doesn't impress.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Grenache that can only be described as strange. The nose is stewy, the palate full of root beer, baked berries and syrup. It's even cloying on the finish. Yet through all that there's still a little something redeeming about it.",Spain,Red Blend
"Reddish in color and plump on the nose. The palate, however, deals only light cherry and dilute berry flavors. Inconsequential on the finish, with little character overall.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy and sweet on the nose, like a jar of strawberry preserves. The palate, however, is light and tart, with burnt berry flavors. Finishes peppery and short, with little to latch onto.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Medicinal and chalky on the nose; tart and lively, with acidic cherry and plum flavors. Short on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Almost volatile with its cooked rhubarb and berry aromas. Screechy black cherry and raspberry flavors don't really help it along. Simply a hard, closed-down wine that isn't up to its price tag.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Seductive and classy aromas of sandalwood, cola, spice, licorice and leather amount to pretty much everything you could ask for. Ripe and complex in terms of its earth and tree-fruit flavors. Finishes svelte and sturdy, but with ample vanilla, toffee and tobacco nuances. Classic gran reserva. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Top-notch manzanilla, plain and simple. What's not plain and simple is the fact that this is so pure and smooth that it dances across your palate. From the vanilla and almond on the nose to the pastry and mushroom on the palate to the creamed butter on the finish, this is as good as it gets in this class.",Spain,Sherry
"Blackberry and cola are the prime aromas that comprise the alluring bouquet. And as you'd expect, there's also leather and spicy wood thrown in. In the mouth, it's an intense ride of rich black cherry and plum. For now it's a little closed on the finish; will likely be better in three years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fresh as can be, with pure aromas of nectarine and cherry blossoms. The palate is light but refreshing and lithe, with semisweet, punchy flavors of orange, peach and pith. Finishes clean and light in the classic, subtle, utilitarian way that a good Rioja rosé should.",Spain,Rosé
"Warm, lightly baked aromas of berries and earth give this a common, likable bouquet, which is backed by a proper feeling palate and flavors of plum, mulberry, earth and herbs. Settles well on the finish, with good length and more than adequate purity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Fairly dense and slightly herbal on the nose, with balsamic notes, dried cheese and mature fruit aromas. This is still spunky and well composed in the mouth, with flavors of tobacco, earthy berry and toasty oak. Shows weight and grab on the finish. An honest, mature wine to drink now; it's not going to improve.",Spain,Garnacha-Cabernet
"Nice on the nose, with berry aromas, ample richness and rubber. The powerful palate delivers big-time blackberry, toast, roasted plum, coffee and chocolate, while the finish is also chocolaty and stout in structure. Chunky but tasty. A good Jumilla wine consisting of 85% Monastrell and 15% Syrah.",Spain,Monastrell
"A chunky, thick, earthy type of wine with syrupy, sweet berry flavors and a friendly palate that's tannic but not too much so. Caramel and carob mix with coffee and cola on the finish, and overall it is good RDD if you don't mind full extraction and syrupy richness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A Priorat blend made in a softer, more simple style. The nose has plum, prune, licorice and rooty scents, which precedes a thick, sweet palate that has mild tannic grip and flavors of raisin, black plum and wild berry. Plump and broad, with good depth.",Spain,Red Blend
"Good for a mature wine but it does smell a bit flat and damp. That murkiness blows off somewhat, leaving a solid, aged Rioja wine with acidic zap and lightly baked berry, cherry, tomato and spice flavors. Mild on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy smelling, with slightly murky baked berry aromas. The palate is juicy and snappy, with strawberry and raspberry flavors that carry a bit of richness. Becomes sweeter as it opens, with vanilla and fresh tomato and herb accents. Reliable as always.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"In the past we've found this wine to be a bit flat and overwooded, but the '04 is balanced, fresh and downright lovely. Light vanilla and toast shadings accent bright peach and melon flavors, and the texture is something to behold. Excluding Valdeorras, this is Galician white wine in its most refined state.",Spain,White Blend
"A small portion of the wine went through malolactic fermentation, so it offers a lovely roundness. Features floral aromas backed by pure tangerine and nectarine flavors. Registers more fruity and smooth than mineral, with a perfect finish.",Spain,Albariño
"A powerful wine with forceful minerality. Still, it's loaded with expressive fruit that falls squarely into the pineapple/mango category. Finishes crisp but precise, with notes of wet stone and lingering nips of green apple and peach.",Spain,Albariño
"Two vintages running this is good, even-flowing rosé. The color is on the red side, but the nose dials in on fluffy red-berry aromas. Plum is the primary fruit flavor, and there's body and a flame of heat and spice to the finish. A good food wine to drink now.",Spain,Rosé
"Light cherry and raspberry aromas take it to a level above neutral, while the palate is just as clean and light, with apricot, peach and strawberry flavors. With some tang and good acidity, it shows freshness and persistence.",Spain,Garnacha
"Initially it smells a bit cheesy and drawn, but with time it evolves to show plum, raspberry and tire rubber aromas. In the mouth, it's tight, fresh and a little gritty, with red-fruit flavors of cherry and raspberry. Not overly generous in terms of mouthfeel, but it does push the fruit until the final bell. More of a food wine than a solo sipper.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with marshmallow-like sweetness on the nose, but that changes to lean fruit and saline with time. The palate is solid and zesty, with standard Rioja-style plum, berry and dill flavors. It's a fresh but quiet wine, with a tight body, medium tannins and pretty good flavors. Well done but nothing unusual.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ochoa usually puts out a good rosado made from Garnacha, and this vintage keeps the winery's reputation intact. It starts with fresh peachy aromas and then comes on with light berry and peach flavors. Arguably a bit candied, but perfectly good for summer quaffing.",Spain,Garnacha
"Light aromas of melon, apple and pear are just fine, and the mildly chunky palate sporting apple-based flavors is good, as is the pineapple finish. Tasty and simple Albariño, and really not much more to say. Good for the summer into fall.",Spain,Albariño
"A sweet, raisiny old-vines Garnacha with candied aromas and a fat, chunky body that houses soft, short black fruit and peppery flavors. Tastes like licorice candy on the finish, which brings some heat and burn as well. An interesting Grenache that is sweet but isn't over the top in terms of ripeness.",Spain,Grenache
"Rusty in color, with initial aromas of smoke, dried leaves, herbs, tobacco and subtle berry. That all indicates that it's not overdone, and thus the tobacco, earth and dried fruit flavors are par for the course. Dry and leafy on the finish, which indicates that now is the time to get at it.",Spain,Garnacha
"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather. The palate has a nice, ripe, bodied feel, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry bring just the slightest hint of herbal green. Toasty and solid on the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas. The palate has good snap and verve to it, while the feel is on the lean side. Flavors of baked berry, earth, caramel and coffee ring true, and the dry, toffee-tinged finish is a nice ending. Ready to go now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors. Warm, simple touches of licorice and mint define the finish. A blend of 60% Monastrell with 20% each Syrah and Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fresh berry aromas carry some spice notes, while the palate is rugged and a little hot. Juicy berry flavors are forward but not overly evolved or complex, and the the finish is tight and aggressive. Spunky and clean, with honest flavors.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A solid but seemingly standard blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha with berry and cherry aromas along with touches of mint and leather. The palate is woody, with spiced berry flavors and decent body and structure. Vanilla and then oak-based bitterness define the finish. A good wine but hardly a knockout.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Tight and largely neutral white fruit aromas show a little apple but little more. The palate is friendly and easy, with melon as the lead flavor. Turns more citrusy and weighty on the finish, which fades fast.",Spain,White Blend
"One of the best $7 wines you'll find from Spain. The nose is bright, medicinal and floral, while the palate is loud and peppy, with sweet red fruit flavors that sport a candied coating. Fresh, tasty and simple, which is what it should be. 60% Bobal and 40% Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Full, roasted and earthy on the nose, with only some coconut and berry aromas to sweeten things up. Tight, level and structured in the mouth, with roasted raspberry and plum along with oaky, buttery, smoky accents that confirm the wine's “roble” designation. Good but with some excess oak to process.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Floral, spicy, semi-oaky aromas precede a tangy, fresh, higher-acid palate with snappy raspberry and red cherry flavors. There's an abundance of pop and snap to this medium-bodied wine, and then drying woody notes to the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of balsam wood, dry leather, and slightly herbal berry fruit are generally appealing, while the palate has size, balance and a healthy feel to it. More woody and spicy than outright fruity, with a touch of zesty raspberry and strawberry at the core. Nice but simple red wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous. The palate is well balanced and the flavors run sweet, ripe and chewy, with berry fruit and creamy licorice notes on the finish. A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Garnacha from Catalonia.",Spain,Syrah-Grenache
"Aromas of cactus pad, green apple and jalapeño are true Verdejo, while the palate brings citrusy, melony fruit as well as chalky, minerally dryness. Tastes a bit like white grape skins, with tangerine and lemon on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Opens with a blast of cola and minty grass, and then comes a raisiny wave and mossy herbal notes that are typical of Navarran Merlot, which makes up 60% of this three-grape blend. Gritty in the mouth, with black cherry, licorice, herbs, raisin and lasting sweetness on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Starts with a crusty, almost mineral top over oaky, chunky blackberry fruit. It's a standard, semiherbal, juicy red blend (75% Tempranillo) with flavors of dried cherry and mocha. Short on the finish, with a hint of vanilla and chocolate. Good overall.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Light and dominated by red fruit from the nose to the palate to the finish. Along the way are edgy accents of spice, stem, citrus and dry oak. Among all the big bruisers out there today, this is more from the old school, meaning it's fresh, lithe and crisp.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts with punchbowl aromas of berry fruit, flowery scents and candy. The palate has a good freshness to it along with snap and flavors of cherry, plum and berry. Nothing complicated here; just a juicy, fresh wine that's likable and not overpriced.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with good berry fruit aromas, mineral notes and coconutty sweetness, which is followed by a plump, well-balanced palate of black fruits, plum and licorice. Finishes solid and warm, with enough vitality and juiciness to maintain balance. More or less what you want from affordable Monastrell.",Spain,Monastrell
"On the plus side, there's a smoky, meaty set of aromas. But on the down side, there's a rubbery character reminiscent of burnt tire tread. That rubbery element passes through to the flavors, which also bring roasted berry into the fold. Rustic stuff with just enough bold berry fruit to make it worth a go.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Begins with muddled, murky, syrupy aromas of caramel and berries. The palate is more high-toned, with lemony accents to tomato, baked fruit and savory flavors. Finishes solid albeit lightly damp and bitter. Comes around with time but always seems a bit murky.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Roasted and mildly leafy, and then clacky and a bit tannic in the mouth. The fruit flavors are good and mostly pure as they settle on black cherry and blackberry, while the finish is jammy but short. For $8 this should not disappoint.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This new wine from the Torres group is a little heavy and baked on the nose, but once you get it onto the palate there's depth, mouthfeel and solid flavors of savory fruit, soy, rubber and dark berry. Dry on the finish, with a mounting note of coffee. Not overly fruity or sweet, which may be a blessing for some palates.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Concentrated, willing aromas of black cherry and sweet plum are nice and friendly, while the palate is lively, juicy and a little tart for Garnacha, with an emphasis on red raspberry. The wine dries out a bit on the finish, leaving vanilla and spice. Good enough for a basic Aragonese red.",Spain,Garnacha
"A pretty good Tempranillo-Garnacha blend with simple but fresh berry and plum aromas. The palate has snap but no overt acidic bite, while flavors of cherry and berry are slightly herbal and end with a mild buttery accent. A touch flimsy but keeps it together.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Standard black-cherry aromas carry a candied, vanilla-like twinge, while the feel is juicy and snappy. Flavors of sweet berries and cherry are just fine, and they come with a nod of spice and bitterness. Punchy and fresh overall, with good ripeness and balance.",Spain,Garnacha
"Punchy berry aromas are floral and jumpy, and the palate is more sheering and tart than expected, but still fresh and clean. Zesty black cherry flavors are softened by buttery oak, and the finish is racy. Could use more flavor and depth along with less acidic bite.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"A better wine than the label's varietal Garnacha, so it seems as though the Tempranillo brings character and elevation. Wild berry and cherry aromas mix in citrus and spice, while the palate is fruity, with pepper and soft spice flavors. Turns a touch tart and toward cranberry the longer it's open.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"A little bit dark and crusty on the bouquet, with murky, earthy black cherry aromas that get clearer and cleaner with air. Briary plum and cherry flavors are solid if nothing else, and the finish is basically more of the same, with length. A competent wine, but that's where it ends.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty, lightly oaked berry aromas are entirely regular, while the berry driven palate is dry, drawing and oaky, with pretty good body but stand-out acidity as well. Tastes a bit woody and peppery late. A highly generic wine that makes you wonder why it costs $30.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Super dense and hard as a rock, with bacon and black fruit aromas that lead straight to a saturated, chewy, tannic palate that pounds away as it delivers blackberry, coffee, licorice and other huge flavors. As big, baked and heavy as they come, with gargantuan tannins. Includes 15% Syrah in addition to Monastrell.",Spain,Monastrell
"Smells sort of gummy and candied, with aromas of red licorice stick, raisin and raspberry jam. The palate is sizable but comes with racy acidity, thus the flavors veer toward red fruits with an herbal accent. Burns a little on the finish due to sharp acids.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lightly stemmy and brambly, with lean red fruit aromas, a touch of saline and red licorice candy. The palate is lean and sort of scratchy, while the flavors are suggestive of red apple skins and red plum. Tight on the finish; similar is some ways to a simple Chianti.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef. It's super-chunky on the tongue, with dominating roasted black fruit flavors. It has its merits but is still too blackened for our liking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Uncomplicated and dominated by red fruit aromas and flavors. This is your everyday type of red wine that could probably be made from just about any grape or blend of grapes. Here, Tempranillo and 15% Shiraz make for a dry, mildly oaky red with freshness and little else. Fine if you're not looking for anything special.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Opens with peppery, earthy black cherry and berry aromas, yet the palate is clacky and narrow, with high acidity and dry, limited flavors of blackberry and black cherry. Narrow as well on the finish. Middle-of-the road and respectable but hardly a head-turner.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little herbal and minty on the nose, but at this price one can't complain too mightily. The palate smacks down with bite and acidity, while the flavors run herbal and a little stemmy, with caramel as a backdrop. Roasted and herbal but not offensive, especially at $7 a bottle.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Heavy, minty and smelling of shoe polish, barrel char and black licorice. The palate is chunky but overall it has pretty good structure. Meanwhile, the flavors of raspberry and plum carry a heavy oak influence. Spice and resin, additional reflections of the oak, dominate the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rather barnyardy and gaseous at first, but air breathes more clarity into the nose. The palate is chunky, grabby and a little awkward, with herbal, medicinal black fruit and buttery flavors. Slight heat and burn hamper the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Big and bold stuff from southern Spain with burnt, hot aromas of roasted black fruits and stems. Better on the palate, where it brings plum and berry flavors but also some heat and saline. Slightly stemmy and roasted on the finish, much like the bouquet.",Spain,Monastrell
"Dark and chunky, but also salinic and clammy smelling, with black fruit aromas sitting in front of a palate of salinic, woody, baked fruit flavors. The tannic finish is hard and edgy, and there's some heat too. Has its high and low points.",Spain,Monastrell
"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.",Spain,Albariño
"Light to medium aromas of cherry and berry are fresh and snappy, while the palate has high acidity, light extract and crisp, almost lean flavors of cherry and red plum. A pointed but clean wine that will do well with simple foods like sliced ham or salami.",Spain,Garnacha
"A touch green smelling, with aromas of coffee grinds and earth. Tannic in the mouth, and then hollow in the middle, with green-leaning, leafy flavors of blackberry and cola. Roasted on the finish, with burnt coffee and chewy, bitter tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rubber and plum aromas are accented by cinnamon spice notes on this fuller-sized, somewhat sticky but basic Garnacha. Dark in color and slightly herbal in terms of flavors, with tart cherry and a slightly dilute feel to the finish. Basic but honest.",Spain,Garnacha
"Basa has long been one of our go-to whites from Rueda, but this vintage seems to be on the slide. The nose is oily and short, while the fruit is turning toward bitter. It still has some vitality and green fruit character, but our advice is to wait for the 2009. A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo.",Spain,White Blend
"Light berry aromas carry a citrusy edge, while the crisp palate is lean but clean, with dry, peppery plum and cherry flavors. There's not too much body or complexity here; it's juicy, a little metallic and highly regular. 60% Tempranillo and 40% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Jammy smelling, with raisin and cough drop aromas. The palate maintains that jammy profile, while the flavors run creamy and short, with a lean toward strawberry and raspberry. A little grassy and green on the finish, with a final dose of candy.",Spain,Red Blend
"A bit strange smelling for Rioja in that the nose deals a mix of candied berry aromas along with stemmy, herbal, compost notes. The palate is thick and chewy, while the flavor profile includes lightly baked, creamy berry and roasted accents. Stocky and fruity but with issues.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Starts out with gassy, earthy aromas that suggest heat and barnyard, while the palate is chunky and full, with stemmy black cherry, plum and berry flavors along with coffee and chocolate accents. Delivers power and length but not much in the way of character or complexity.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A mix of standard berry fruit and leafy, herbal qualities is the starting point. Next up is a tangy, acidic palate of red fruits, vanilla, acidity and ultimately some bitterness. Short and gritty on the finish. Tastes and smells like mass-market Bordeaux. A blend of 60% Tempranillo and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Hot, earthy aromas settle on leather and tomato, while the palate is gritty and tastes of dark, smoky, chunky black fruit. More tangy and angular on the finish than desirable, with limited depth. Standard stuff on its best day.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Warm and smelling of menthol, cough syrup and sweet, jammy berry fruit. The palate is also fairly medicinal in terms of flavor, while the feel is a bit hard and underdeveloped. Turns more tart and herbal the more you get to know it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stemmy and leathery smelling, with heat, roasted fruit and cheesy aromas. The palate is full but soupy, with roasted, baked black fruit flavors. A bit of cinnamon and spice help out the finish, but by then the wine's very average fate has been sealed.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A little burnt and leathery smelling, with stem, bramble and raspberry aromas. The palate is sheering and tight, with semisharp acidity enlivening herbal, peppery red fruit flavors. As a whole, there isn't a lot of substance here to weigh.",Spain,Garnacha
"Clearly this isn't a vintage for long keeping. In fact, one of our usual favorite Ruedas is already on the downslide. The nose is chunky pineapple and the palate is dull and wayward, with flat, pithy citrus. Lacks the vibrancy José Pariente is know for. Wait for the 2009.",Spain,Verdejo
"Minty and herbal smelling, with stemmy, generic fruit aromas. The palate is sticky and creamy, while the flavors are chunky, flat and lean toward herbal berry. An oaky, syrupy wine with a mild green streak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flat and fleshy smelling, with little zap and only soft green fruit aromas. The palate maintains some tang and citrus, while flavors of lemon and tangerine are chunky, loud and lean toward bitter on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Pineapple aromas lead to a soft, smooth, but lifeless palate of slightly bitter melon and banana flavors. Pithy on the finish and short on pulse. Drink immediately or let it go by altogether.",Spain,Verdejo
"Nothing special about this blend of Tempranillo and Shiraz. In fact, it's more austere and less pleasing than the brand's basic 2007 Temp-Shiraz blend. That said, this wine shows thin raspberry flavors and a tangy, almost sour back end. Probably best with food; not real good on its own.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Cherry and mild sawdust aromas are brought down by sharpness that is almost vinegar-like. The palate has an acceptable mouthfeel along with sweet and sour flavors of plum and berry. Tart on the finish, and a bit stemmy and sharp throughout.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earth, rubber and chunky black fruit aromas make for a heavy, muddled nose, while the medium-sized palate is stewy and briary, with jammy flavors of red fruits and rubber. More stewed and medicinal than anything.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sharp, medicinal and a little skunky to start with, and it remains acidic, tangy and hard in the mouth, with cranberry and cough medicine for flavors. Herbal and cutting on the finish. Not much to write home about.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells like wet cement, spearmint and light red fruits. The palate is dilute and acidic, with tangy, citrusy flavors of raspberry and cherry. Citric on the finish as well, although on the plus side you could say it's crisp and mostly fresh.",Spain,Tempranillo
"While this wine doesn't really appeal to us, we can envision fans of Old World, leaner, more acidic wines signing on. What we see, however, is a light-bodied, high-acid wine with tart, lean raspberry and cherry skin flavors and a sour finish. Fresh for sure, but hollow and in need of more.",Spain,Monastrell
"Gassy smelling and candied on the nose, with medicinal, jumpy cherry aromas. The palate is hot and hard, with underwhelming, semisour plum and berry flavors. Herbal on the back end, with a weak, faux buttery aftertaste.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Green to the point of being vegetal, with bell pepper and green bean aromas in addition to hidden berry fruit. It's grabby and tannic across the palate, while the flavors run toward green fruit and caramel. Deficient and hard as nails.",Spain,Tempranillo
"As in previous years, this wine just isn't that fresh and pure. The nose is briney, and the palate follows suit. There's some chunky grapefruit to ponder, but there's unavoidable pickled, vegetal notes come finishing time.",Spain,Rosé
"Candied on one hand but also gassy, barnyardy and less than clean and pure on the other. A basic mouthfeel is probably the high point, while flavors of underdeveloped berry fruit are more salty and leathery than anything. Fails to impress.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Funky smelling and unfamiliar, with sweet, candied spice notes and strange candied cherry aromas. Vibrant and bouncy in terms of feel, but follows the nose by tasting sweet and weird. Weak on the finish as well.",Spain,Garnacha
"Smells like compost, and never does that earthy, stenchiness lift. The palate is thick and muddled, with wan, dry, buttery raspberry flavors that lack direction. Finishes dry and bland, without much structure.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells candied as well as burnt and stemmy. The palate is adequate on the surface but hollow in the middle, with dry, herbal raspberry flavors. Tastes more stemmy and distracted the longer you play with it. Not ready for prime time.",Spain,Monastrell
"Dull aromas of raspberry and plum skins turn sweeter with air, but the palate is too centered on thick, creamy, generic berry flavors that turn raisiny and chunky with time. Not grabby or cloying, but even so this wine doesn't hit many high notes.",Spain,Monastrell
"Jammy, sweet and extremely raisiny, with a nose that matches the palate. Low in acid, so low in pulse. Pruney on the finish and seemingly overripe. Not well balanced.",Spain,Garnacha
"Colorful but aromatically defined by lean, green alfalfa, which doesn't portend much good. The palate is hard and underwhelming, with herbal, almost green berry fruit flavors. Similar on the finish. A 200,000-case product that comes across like a 200,000-case product.",Spain,Red Blend
"Only if you enjoy very lean, ultrafresh and tart red wines will this work. It starts with simple punchbowl aromas of red grapes and berry, and then comes a skinny, tart, grating palate that's all acid and no substance. Calling it “traditional” or a “terroir” wine would only be misleading.",Spain,Monastrell
"A weird wine in every way. The nose smells like something off the grid, with briney fruit, funky spice notes and compost. Creamy and oaky in the mouth, with herbal flavors and a dash of nutmeg and/or cardamom. Hard on the finish, and just too strange to bother with.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A burnt, stemmy nose is an indicator of what's to some. And while the palate has an o.k. feel to it, the flavors here are bitter, herbal and burnt. A wine that lacks freshness of fruit.",Spain,Monastrell
"Stemmy, brambly raspberry aromas lead to a scouring, light palate of snappy, sharp-tasting red cherry and plum-skin flavors. Lean to the point that it's almost sour, and overall it's stretched extremely thin.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Burnt smelling at first, and tart throughout, with pie cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors. There's not much to measure here; the wine runs sour and tastes mostly of red fruit skins and citric acid. 65% Tempranillo and 35% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Way too charred and roasted. The mouthfeel is acceptable and ranks as the best part of the wine. The rest is just a burnt, charred, overoaked mess with flavors of earthy berry, leather, peanut and resin. A poor effort that makes you wonder what the winery was thinking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flat and gaseous smelling, with sulfur and no fruit to speak of. Tastes like bland nectarine and tangerine, and the body and finish are almost flabby. Borderline in terms of its acceptability.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Soft, chunky and fading fast, with aromas of asparagus and canned green beans. The palate is flat as a board, with vegetal flavors and bitterness on the finish. Barely worth a sip at this point in its evolution.",Spain,Verdejo
"If it weren't for the wine's stout color and pretty good mouthfeel, we'd sink it. The nose is green and cheesy, and the flavors are also green almost to the point of vegetal. Stemmy on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Heavy and definitely on the mealy side of the fence, and fighting for any semblance of balance. Pithy as well. Sadly, the citrus fruit in this wine is not that appealing.",Spain,Godello
"Quite sweaty, oily and hard, almost like an underdeveloped Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is also on the bitter, oily, pithy side, with only a little grapefruit and orange working their way through.",Spain,White Blend
"This is showing mineral, saline, spice, peach and melon—all good signs. The palate leans toward tropical, with pineapple leading the way. With no surprises, it finishes clean and a touch fleshy. An excellent Albariño that's maturing quickly. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"A unique take on Manzanilla Sherry, which is often light and sea-flecked but in this case is more amber, hazy and full. The nose is racy and spicy, while the palate offers dried apricots, orange peel and salt. Finishes with tang offsetting hazelnut and walnut notes. Oily, interesting and very good if you are a Sherry fan.",Spain,Sherry
"Spicy and a little woody on the bouquet, with ripe black-fruit aromas, a speck of mineral and a touch of cough drop. This is Torres' first commercial Priorat wine, and it's not a tannic specimen, yet the raspberry and dark-fruit flavors are sound and tasty. Finishes smooth, with a beam of acidity keeping it in balance. Drink now or at any time over the next few years.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark and definitely not reserved, this is a big blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot that pours on the rich blackberry, cola, chocolate and smoke character. A lot of powerful new oak backs it all up, leaving espresso bitterness and mocha sweetness on the finish. A modern wine with ample lushness.",Spain,Red Blend
"Overall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Àn has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors. Finishes with pepper and a lash of leftover oak that hopefully will disappear as the wine ages. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Garnacha is the lead in this five-grape blend, and overall it shows almost all of what's good about Catalonian wine. The nose offers sweet cherry and a whiff of hard dried cheese; the palate is racy at first and then thickens as blackberry, red licorice and fig flavors take over. A steady wine.",Spain,Red Blend
"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon. So unless you have years to cellar this wine, it will likely hold onto its hard, tannic personality. Hold another three years, if possible.",Spain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"This wine is made from old-vines Verdejo and it shows more minerality and intensity than something made from younger grapes. The nose has wax, mineral and citrus aromas, while the palate shows passion fruit and pineapple flavors. Grows on you nicely with structure, acidity and a smack of Rueda terroir.",Spain,Verdejo
"The gold tint may look imposing, and it does signal a richer-styled wine. But let this heavier, more ripe Albariño roll over your palate and you'll probably wind up liking its citrus and nectarine flavors but softer body. Finishes with apricot, kumquat and vanilla notes. An interesting wine to drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Mallorca gives us this ripe but intriguing mix of Mantonegro, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. The new oak on the nose is plentiful, and along with that there's asphalt and marshmallow. The palate is full with berry and plum flavors, and there's a fleshy and plump character to the finish. A worthy wine from off the beaten path.",Spain,Red Blend
"Ripe plum and berry aromas are on the soft and cuddly side, but have some spunk. The palate on this classic Garnacha-Craignan-Syrah blend is adequately juicy and fresh, with a basket's worth of berry flavor. And the finish is complementary and offers some chocolate as an aftertaste. Drink now and over the next two years.",Spain,Red Blend
"Youthful and exuberant, with a generous blend of lead pencil, molasses and plum/berry aromas. Torres got the perfect level of ripeness and balance in this favorable vintage, and thus this is probably as good a Merlot as you're ever going to see from the Penedès. It's full and just sweet enough. Drink now through 2010.",Spain,Merlot
"Darker and a touch more stewy than the winery's less pricey old-vines effort. Airing loosens it up, but throughout it's a big, stewy wine with extracted blackberry and coffee cake flavors. The finish is equally on the rich side, with swirling toffee and coffee afternotes. It's a big wine with heft but also some chunkiness.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark as night, with forceful aromas of root beer, menthol, warm earth and baked fruits. Maybe it's a bit soft and widespread given the heat of 2003, but if flesh and fruit turn you on and the lack of complexity isn't too disconcerting, it's a fine modern Syrah. Good with bacon burgers, steak off the grill, etc.",Spain,Syrah
"Dusty black cherry and raspberry aromas are true to the variety, and the buttery quality on the palate adds weight and vanilla to the berry and cassis flavors. Overall this is a structured, fairly oaky wine with firm tannins and a toasty finish. Will go well with steak.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"The earthy brick color and dry fruit aromas announce that this isn't a typical wine. The blend is Merlot, Callet and Syrah, and it hails from the island of Mallorca. The wine is a bit tough and angular, but the plum, raspberry and cherry flavors are tightly formed and fenced in by potent acidity and oak. Interesting but not for everyone.",Spain,Red Blend
"Heavily oaked and loaded down with butter and resin, this is a wine for those infatuated with the obscure. The blend is 90% Callet and 10% Fogoneu, and don't ask us to give you the history of these Mallorcan grapes. Suffice it to say that this wine is broad, a bit stewy and very different. It's not heavy like an anchor but it has its chunky shoulder pads to deal with. Only 25 cases made.",Spain,Red Blend
"An austere blend of Cab Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot. There's color and power galore, but also a choppy, firm mouthfeel that guards intense cherry flavors and smoldering oak. An aggressive wine that doesn't back down from its essence. Will do much better with food than by itself.",Spain,Red Blend
"Emina is a label under the Matarromera group, and this Rueda white (80% Verdejo and 20% Viura) is light, clean and a touch flowery. But mostly it pumps forth with simple orange and grapefruit qualities along with lemon drops on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"This is an interesting wine that offers a nice perfume but limited flavors and complexity. So what makes it so interesting, you ask? Well, the fact that it's varietal Petit Verdot from the Duero River Valley, which is not common; that and the fact that it's a mind-boggling $200. The wine itself shows a deep color, vanilla and cocoa flavors, and a range of dark-berry flavors. Elegant and provacative, it's not.",Spain,Petit Verdot
"Welcome back to the classic off-dry Sherry that helped make the category's reputation. It's amber in color, with toasted almonds, citrus peel and cinnamon on the nose. The mouthfeel is solid and not too overtly sweet, and the finish is coated with burnt brown sugar. Best served on the rocks, or at least with a very good chill.",Spain,Sherry
"Starts with aromas of clove, Band-Aid and other spicy aromas. It has a minor herbal essence both on the nose and palate, which is typical of Spanish Cabernet. But the feel is good and chewy, while the oak is moderate as it supports raspberry and dry cherry flavors. Features 15% Tempranillo; drink now.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Borderline exotic on the nose, with aromas of black cherry, violet and a touch of earthy leather. The palate has some prickle and snap to it, but it settles into lively black plum and boysenberry. Finishes smooth, ripe and big, with medium length. The coupage is 80% Syrah and 20% Monastrell.",Spain,Syrah
"Consistent with past vintages, this crianza gets it right without setting off any balloons. It starts with raspberry and cassis aromas and backs that up with slightly citrusy red-fruit flavors. Any rawness or heat on the palate will be tamed by matching it with meat, chorizo, ham, cheese, etc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An oily, earthy wine with plenty of belt strap and dark fruit on the nose. The palate is a bit scattered, but there's ample mineral and blackberry to move it forward. The feel is choppy due to pronounced acidity, yet the finish is generally clean and fluid.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stocky and warm, with mild baked-fruit aromas and a hint of bramble. This venerable table wine is made from 65% Garnacha and 35 Cariñena, and from 2005 it's pretty much on the money. Expect earthy, mildly brambly flavors, lively acidity and soft tannins. Good for a wide range of simple foods and appetizers.",Spain,Red Blend
"A holdover from 1999, this varietal single-vineyard Cabernet offers tree bark, molasses and prune on the nose, while the palate has raspberry flavors sitting front and center, with drying tannins in support. It's a woody and grabby wine, with vanilla notes toward the end. And at eight years old, it doesn't appear as though it will improve beyond where it's at now. So drink soon.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Slightly warmer in style, with caramel and vanilla aromas, yet the palate runs more toward freshness, with orange and pineapple standing out. With its good acidity and zest, this wine won't ever be called flabby. Drink now for solid results.",Spain,Verdejo
"Lots of oak gives the nose a strong coconut essence, while the flavors of baked red plum and berries bring along notes of pepper and spice. This is a meaty, hot wine with maple and resin on the finish. It shows flashes of brilliance but also ruggedness and a few clumsy characteristics.",Spain,Red Blend
"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness.",Spain,Tempranillo
A better effort than in previous years. This vintage has a tangy personality and no tricks up its sleeve. The pineapple and citrus flavors are solid and the finish holds onto the Verdejo's citrusy profile. Steady and clean all the way through.,Spain,Verdejo
"Early on the wine is dominated by buttery oak, and it's all over the nose, palate and finish. Airing settles it down, and up from the creamy underworld comes raspberry, stewed plums and chocolate. Not the thinking man's Ribera del Duero, but it gets the job done. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This Garnacha- and Carignan-based wine offers a brilliant color and a true bouquet of graphite, mineral, char and black fruit. Thus expectations are high as you head to the palate, which turns out to be sheer, acidic and hard. Amid the scour you'll pull out plum and blackberry flavors. It gets it two-thirds right; the nose and color are there but the mouthfeel is lacking.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mineral, citrus, natural vanilla and grass aromas send this still-kicking Verdejo on its way. The palate is all about apple and citrus, and the feel is more polished than edgy. Seems as if it's flattening and losing some steam, so drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"Peach, nectarine and green pear aromas and flavors dominate this ripe-styled Verdejo-Viura blend. Typical of Rueda, it's citrusy and a zesty, but there's enough warmth and heft so that you wouldn't call it steely or stark. Drink now.",Spain,White Blend
"A little warmer and rounder than most. This waxy wine offers banana and melon on the nose, while the palate is just juicy and racy enough, with apple and citrus anchoring things. Finishes easy and will go well with salads and seafood.",Spain,White Blend
"Sulfurous early on, and then citrus and apple blossom aromas get into the game. The palate is ripe and tropical, with melon, mango and banana flavors. With no angularity or sharpness, this is an easy wine with soft edges. Drink now before it gets even softer.",Spain,Verdejo
"Berry fruit, vanilla and violet aromas are friendlier than the rugged, ultrafirm palate on this Syrah-Graciano blend. With food, the wine will be a strong counterpoint and will hold its own. By itself it may slip in pleasure points; the Graciano is tight as nails and adds astringency. Imported by Möet Hennessy USA, Inc.",Spain,Red Blend
"Open, round and a bit rubbery, this bright-styled wine is jammy and easy to drink. It has black cherry and blueberry flavors riding on grabby tannins, and the finish is where you get some of the “roble,” meaning oak-based chocolate and vanilla notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not a bad value in the Albariño category. Alba Rosa is the second wine from Martinez Serantes, and it's yellowish in color, with a pineapple and pear nose. Solid in the mouth, with touches of apple, white peach and lime. Proper acidity keeps it fresh.",Spain,Albariño
"The nose has the vintage's heavy quality, yet the palate runs toward acidic, with an emphasis on red cherry and raspberry. The more it opens, and the more the wine's tannins and acids do their thing, the tougher it gets. Food seems like a must.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cantaloupe, almond candy and orange blossom make for a sweet nose. The palate seems too close to orange juice and tangerine than the apple and peach that best defines Rías Baixas. But for anyone who likes fresh, pulpy juice, it tastes perfectly good.",Spain,Albariño
"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an ‘03, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smooth on the nose, with vanilla and peach aromas. It's starting to fade but if you catch it soon you'll get apple, pineapple and some pithy character on both the palate and finish. Tastes wet and easy, and not at all complicated.",Spain,White Blend
"Lush and full-bodied, this Tempranillo from vines more than 65 years of age handles its size gracefully, with precise flavors of blackberries and peppery spice rounded out by hints of vanilla and tobacco.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With its creamy oak and baked, stretched-out flavors, is it worth $110? You can decide, but the nose has that mildly cooked, heavy character that is reflective of 2003, and the palate is bland and drying as it mixes in oaky coconut and vanilla flavors. At one moment it's sharp and tangy; then it seems better. A confounding Tempranillo that doesn't excite.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Leathery and peanutty on the nose; soon the aromas expand to baked plum and stewy berries. The palate is sturdy and tannic, but there's enough flesh and weight to the fruit that it's mostly balanced. Finishes with bacon and leather accents.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Osborne can usually be counted on for consistency and traditional flavors. But this Amontillado is all over the map. The nose has some harsh chemical compounds, while the palate is salty like a handfull of peanuts. Shows flashes but tends to fall back into a realm best left alone. Imported by W. J. Deutsch & Sons.",Spain,Sherry
"Not every swing for the fences is rewarded with a home run. This wine, from a hot year, spent 22 months in oak. Thus it's a firebomb of dark, medicinal fruit mixed with root beer, lemon peel and creamy chocolate. Never does it really unfold or find a groove, and at times it's aggressive.",Spain,Tempranillo
"At 70% Tempranillo and only 25% Cabernet and Merlot, there's a detectable green core running through the nose and palate. Surrounding that is sizable fruit and oak, the latter of which adds dill to the fray. All in all there's enough body and soul to save the wine, but along the way it's got some issues.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A new take on Harveys Bristol Cream. Instead of you adding a twist of orange with the final pour, they've done it for you. But as with many infused drinks, the aromas are kind of artificial and the flavors run straight to candied and never come back. Worth a go if you like orange as a lead flavor—serve on the rocks.",Spain,Sherry
"Verdejo and Viura comprise this mineral- and pepper-tinged wine. The palate is clean but a touch blanced out and drying. Flavors of citrus, apple and banana transform into walnut and aging cider on the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Heavily stewed and raisiny, almost to the point of no return. And while the wine is definitely cooked and starchy, it rallies on the palate and finish to show some decent Priorat-style richness and flavor. But let's face it, the wine is 80% baked and won't last for much longer.",Spain,Red Blend
"Big, bulky and struggling for balance. The alcohol is 15.5% and we can't say that it wears it well. The nose is sulfuric and smells quite a bit like spent fireworks, and after that match stick quality blows off what's left is mostly black fruit, extract, tannin and heat. 450 cases made.",Spain,Red Blend
Simple on the nose and like biting into a green apple when you taste it. There isn't much structure or grab to the wine; it's more like a wet wash of the mouth that finishes like ginger ale. An easy game to solve; drink now.,Spain,Albariño
"“Light” is misleading, because this really isn't a light fino at all. In fact, it's rather heavy and clunky, with a salty undercurrent to its lemon and nut flavors. Tastes more cooked than ideal.",Spain,Sherry
"Cola, cherry and mint aromas give reason for optimisim, but the palate is extraordinarily hard and acidic. Thus the flavors are of lemony citrus more than Tempranillo, and the feel is stark as nails. You can see certain positives but balance and mouthfeel aren't among them.",Spain,Tempranillo
"In general O. Fournier gets it right, be it in Spain or Argentina. But this Ribera del Duero struggles from the outset. It's rubbery, damp and lacks clarity of fruit. And the feel is sharp and lemony, seemingly a combo of excessive oak and raw fruit. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Candied fruit and punch bowl aromas are not what you'd call sophisticated, and the mouth pretty much follows suit with tart, rubbery raspberry fruit that comes on a bit hot and raw. Tough but with full flavor; sort of like chewing on a plum skin.",Spain,Mencía
"Lean, dry aromas of cherry skins and citrus lead to a competent but basic palate of raspberry and cherry flavors. Everything about this wine screams “regular,” from the tart red fruit core to the tough but fresh mouthfeel to the edgy finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Vivid pink in color, with dusty, easygoing raspberry aromas. The palate is a bit soft and low in acidity, which indicates that this is the year to drink the wine...and as soon as possible. Flavors of cherry and strawberry are regular, if a touch bitter toward the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"By no means is this the best wine from Pedrosa; it has decent red berry aromas, but what you really get is minty, forward oak. The palate has an acidic tang to it that suggests medium ripeness, while flavors of cherry tomatoes, herbs, vanilla and mint take you only so far. More barrel than substance here.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Minty-grassy top aromas indicate that the wine, while endowed with decent berry character, has an herbal side as well. In the mouth, it's hard, lean and compact, with tart cherry/plum flavors and a quick finish. Basic with a touch of sourness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with a blast of hot, basic red fruit that's fiery and a little pickled. The palate is lean and acidic but doesn't burn, while the cherry and red plum flavors are elementary. Inoffensive, highly regular red wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Just like the previous vintage, this is a melony, fresh wine with apple aromas backed by a semi-creamy palate of peach and banana. It has a soft outlook but it isn't flabby, and thus a slight finishing note of powdered sugar and vanilla frosting seems right. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd. Best Buy.",Spain,Viura
"Slightly baked and raisiny, with aromas of black currants and blackberry jam. The palate pushes some zest and kick, while the raspberry and plum flavors are best initially and then break up before a simple finish. Offers a good midlevel taste of Priorato. Imported by Fine Estates From Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"An interesting white wine based on Chardonnay and Xarello. It's like Cava without the fizz, and the nose starts out dry and like Sherry before green apple and lime come into view. Tastes really dry and chalky, with mineral and apple at its core. Imported by Organic Vintners.",Spain,White Blend
"Starts with tough, almost harsh green aromas on the nose, but with time it settles on herbs and tobacco. The palate is fresh but a touch spiky and grabby, with herbal plum and berry flavors. Solid mouthfeel and length make it worthwhile even if it's herbal and slightly green tasting.",Spain,Garnacha
"Opens with vinaigrette and balsamic notes along with leather and black fruit aromas. The palate is soft and muddled, with soupy, stewy flavors and a jagged, candied finish. Seems to struggle for balance, which is a common flaw in many Toro wines.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Sweet, plummy and unrefined on both the nose and palate. This is nothing more than simple juice that isn't terrible. It's grapey, sweet and tart, with an edgy bit of tang to the finish. Regular at best; subpar if you're being critical.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy aromas mix with grassy green notes in front of a sweet, chunky palate that offers unconvincing, generic berry flavors. Devoid of elegance and character but loaded with heft and baked fruit. A sweet, rudimentary wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Balsamic and hard, with a briney, stemmy set of chemical-tinged black fruit aromas. The palate hits with force and noise; it's hard, tannic and unforgiving. The flavors of baked berry are rich, but the finish is grating and blazes with tannic burn.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Concentrated, willing aromas of black cherry and sweet plum are nice and friendly, while the palate is lively, juicy and a little tart for Garnacha, with an emphasis on red raspberry. The wine dries out a bit on the finish, leaving vanilla and spice. Good enough for a basic Aragonese red.",Spain,Garnacha
"A pretty good Tempranillo-Garnacha blend with simple but fresh berry and plum aromas. The palate has snap but no overt acidic bite, while flavors of cherry and berry are slightly herbal and end with a mild buttery accent. A touch flimsy but keeps it together.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Standard black-cherry aromas carry a candied, vanilla-like twinge, while the feel is juicy and snappy. Flavors of sweet berries and cherry are just fine, and they come with a nod of spice and bitterness. Punchy and fresh overall, with good ripeness and balance.",Spain,Garnacha
"Concentrated to the max, with young, closed aromas of coconut, charcoal, mint leaf, leather, hot pavement and black fruit. The palate is juvenile, full and warm, and it delivers a jolt of meaty black fruit, licorice and baking-spice flavors. Toasty late, with no shortage of structure and oak. Should age well for a decade or so.",Spain,Red Blend
"One sniff gives you all the info needed to process this as a terrific modern Rioja. It's rich, cuddly, oaky and minty, with tons of spice and black fruit. The palate is juicier than in the past, with lively black cherry, cassis, tobacco, vanilla and mocha flavors. Yet another fine Nieta from the Eguren family. Drink now through 2018.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Strawberry and raspberry aromas come on with aggression, and the bouquet doesn't really evolve. The palate is crisp, snappy and high in acid, with grating red cherry and red plum flavors. Decent red fruit character throughout but not much feel or depth.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mint, carob and green-tinged fruit aromas precede an herbal-tasting palate with olive-influenced plum, berry and cola flavors. From down south in Spain, it shows pretty good body and an okay mouthfeel, but the flavor profile is a little funky and strange.",Spain,Garnacha
"Same score as the prior year, and pretty much the same wine. It's dusty and slightly burnt in aromas and flavors, with banana, peach and pithy bitterness extending onto the finish. Mouthfeel is the best part; otherwise it struggles to make the cut.",Spain,White Blend
"Saucy and jammy initially, and then a raisiny quality takes over. Plump and thick in the mouth, but ultra jammy in terms of mouthfeel. Syrupy and raisiny flavors run the game, and in the end it weighs in as an overripe wine from one of the hottest vintages on record.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard and earthy, with black fruit aromas that are big but closed. The palate is short, stocky and blocky, with mammoth but basic flavors that turn rubbery. Not much of a finish to speak of.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Disappointing given Telmo Rodriguez's overall track record. Dehesa Gago 2008 is jumpy, sweaty and stemmy smelling, with weedy, burnt, acrid flavors. Green, hard and bitter on the back end, with a candied sweetness. Try as we might, we can't find the higher level in this Toro red.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fairly green, a bit oxidized and old smelling. The palate is short and choppy, with hard leftover tannins and dry, herbal fruit flavors that push up against vegetal. Sweetness re-enters the picture on the finish, but overall this is too dried up and strained to rate higher.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Briary, herbal aromas bring hints of tomato sauce and burnt leaves to the game, while the palate is fairly innocuous in feel. Flavors of herbal berry fruit and beets are sweet and strained, while the finish hints at green herbs and dried leaves.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Leafy, dry and mature, with baked fruit and aromas of dried oregano and basil flakes. The palate has grating tannins, while the flavors are greenish and herbal, with hints of stewed berries and burnt grass. Grabby and stalky; not sure why this old three-grape blend is still on the market.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Banana and green herb aromas make for a challenging nose. The palate has verve and acidity but its flavors of dull white fruits, melon and peach are jumbled. A clumsy mishmash of a wine; 80% Macabeo (Viura) and 20% Chardonnay.",Spain,White Blend
"Bell pepper, green bean, green tobacco, tomato and herb aromas carry the nose toward an acid-dominated palate of tomato sauce and herbal fruit. Finishes dry and herbal, and a little bit sour. With 25% Cabernet, this is a small step up from Earth's 100% Tempranillo.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"This wine explores the fresher, racier side of the Priorat region. Berry fruit with just the slightest hint of raisin dominates the nose and the palate. Flavors of red plum and raspberry are borderline scouring, but then the finish gives some mocha and sage to bring everything into focus. Best with food; drink now. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Tropical and easy to like. We don't see many white Garnachas in the U.S., but this one shows mango, melon and vanilla on the nose and the palate follows up with lychee, apple and baking spice flavors. Plump and mellow but with adequate acidity; refreshing while it's young. Drink now. Imported by Grapes of Spain. Best Buy.",Spain,Grenache Blanc
"Gritty, granular and a bit raisiny at first, and then more settled later on. For Monastrell this is snappy, dry and solid, with cherry, raspberry, plum and vanilla forming a standard flavor package. The finish offers a bit of chocolate cream, but overall it's basic, tannic and full, with some bite.",Spain,Red Blend
"Punchy berry aromas are floral and jumpy, and the palate is more sheering and tart than expected, but still fresh and clean. Zesty black cherry flavors are softened by buttery oak, and the finish is racy. Could use more flavor and depth along with less acidic bite.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"A better wine than the label's varietal Garnacha, so it seems as though the Tempranillo brings character and elevation. Wild berry and cherry aromas mix in citrus and spice, while the palate is fruity, with pepper and soft spice flavors. Turns a touch tart and toward cranberry the longer it's open.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"A little bit dark and crusty on the bouquet, with murky, earthy black cherry aromas that get clearer and cleaner with air. Briary plum and cherry flavors are solid if nothing else, and the finish is basically more of the same, with length. A competent wine, but that's where it ends.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty, lightly oaked berry aromas are entirely regular, while the berry driven palate is dry, drawing and oaky, with pretty good body but stand-out acidity as well. Tastes a bit woody and peppery late. A highly generic wine that makes you wonder why it costs $30.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Smells fairly burnt and dull, with earthy, stemmy aromas that are strained and tough. The palate reflects the nose with heavy, roasted, leathery plum flavors that finish with a meaty thud. Rustic and stemmy, with a low pulse.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Jammy and flat smelling, with little to no depth to the nose. The palate is snappy but there's just enough body to offset the acidity, while the flavors of red fruits are tart and regular. Dull tasting, with a fairly long finish that's unexciting.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A green, struggling wine from front to back. The nose kicks up underripe aromas to go with distant red fruit, while the palate is edgy and prickly, with high acidity creating snappy cherry and green flavors.",Spain,Garnacha
"Hard, leathery aromas, with an intense but exceedingly tannic palate. Killer bite and raspy, with bitterness and heat. Has decent black fruit flavor but still it's tough and unrefined.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stemmy, pickled aromas send the fruit component to second fiddle. Tastes, smells and feels like a wine that didn't get fully ripe; the flavors are thin and light, with tea and dilute berry. Finishes same as above.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with hard, ripe, almost forced aromas, which settle with air. The palate is wiry, firm and a touch hot, with cola, raspberry and plum flavors that rattle around on a bed of racy acidity. Finishes rather lean and raw, but with honest flavors of Garnacha and Carignan, which comprise 90% of the blend. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromatically forward, with rubbery blackberry and grilled meat aromas. When it settles it shows grapey flavors and a chewy mouthfeel. Grabby, alert and snappy on the finish; this wine doesn't lack bounce or kick.",Spain,Red Blend
"Nice black cherry, cracked pepper and a slight wave of perfume make the nose attractive, while the palate is bright and a touch sharp with red-fruit flavors. Cherry, red plum and gentle spice notes work the finish, and overall the wine seems honest and well made.",Spain,Garnacha
"Lightly fragrant and fruity on the nose, with earth and leather to give it meaning. The palate is medium-weight, with fresh berry and cherry flavors along with finishing notes of pepper and tobacco. Rumbles along like a good, everyday, classic Rioja. A throwback in style. Imported by Palm Bay International.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Super dense and hard as a rock, with bacon and black fruit aromas that lead straight to a saturated, chewy, tannic palate that pounds away as it delivers blackberry, coffee, licorice and other huge flavors. As big, baked and heavy as they come, with gargantuan tannins. Includes 15% Syrah in addition to Monastrell.",Spain,Monastrell
"Smells sort of gummy and candied, with aromas of red licorice stick, raisin and raspberry jam. The palate is sizable but comes with racy acidity, thus the flavors veer toward red fruits with an herbal accent. Burns a little on the finish due to sharp acids.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lightly stemmy and brambly, with lean red fruit aromas, a touch of saline and red licorice candy. The palate is lean and sort of scratchy, while the flavors are suggestive of red apple skins and red plum. Tight on the finish; similar is some ways to a simple Chianti.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef. It's super-chunky on the tongue, with dominating roasted black fruit flavors. It has its merits but is still too blackened for our liking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard, pickled aromas settle on leathery and burnt after airing. The palate is jammy and sticky, with sweet, heavy, roasted, burnt-tasting black fruit flavors. Resiny as well. Tempranillo with 10% Syrah.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Very strange from the start. Odd stuff, with a candied, spice-like set of aromas that go straight to sweet, dull gumdrop flavors. Feels o.k. on the palate but tastes and smells weird.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Simple to the point of being boring. Aromas of generic white fruits don't stand out, while the palate is soft and tastes vaguely of kiwi and nectarine. Finishes flat. Similar to the 2007.",Spain,Xarel-lo
"Aromas of mealy melon, pineapple juice and warm radiator dust do nothing to distinguish this Viura-led white. The palate is clipped and tangy, with citrus flavors leading to a pithy, orange-peel finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Excessive green bean, green tobacco and grass on the nose put this into the “challenged” category. The palate is tart and tomatoey, with herbal raspberry flavors and a leafy, green finish. Barely registers on the pleasure meter.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite dilute, with gaseous, chemical aromas that subside with time but never really leave. The palate is dry, mulchy and briney, and dig as you might, there is never much fruit to latch onto. Too thin, even for a cool year like 2007.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stemmy and green, with herbal, earthy aromas. The palate doesn't offer much besides acid, stemmy flavors and herbal notes, and there's a spot of green bitterness to the finish. Not a lot going on here; acceptable at best.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard and oily smelling, with an acrid overtone. The palate is grating and tastes of bitter, pithy citrus, while the finish is equally bitter, with grapefruit pith lasting too long. Expensive for what you get.",Spain,White Blend
"Uncomplicated and dominated by red fruit aromas and flavors. This is your everyday type of red wine that could probably be made from just about any grape or blend of grapes. Here, Tempranillo and 15% Shiraz make for a dry, mildly oaky red with freshness and little else. Fine if you're not looking for anything special.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Opens with peppery, earthy black cherry and berry aromas, yet the palate is clacky and narrow, with high acidity and dry, limited flavors of blackberry and black cherry. Narrow as well on the finish. Middle-of-the road and respectable but hardly a head-turner.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little herbal and minty on the nose, but at this price one can't complain too mightily. The palate smacks down with bite and acidity, while the flavors run herbal and a little stemmy, with caramel as a backdrop. Roasted and herbal but not offensive, especially at $7 a bottle.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Heavy, minty and smelling of shoe polish, barrel char and black licorice. The palate is chunky but overall it has pretty good structure. Meanwhile, the flavors of raspberry and plum carry a heavy oak influence. Spice and resin, additional reflections of the oak, dominate the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rather barnyardy and gaseous at first, but air breathes more clarity into the nose. The palate is chunky, grabby and a little awkward, with herbal, medicinal black fruit and buttery flavors. Slight heat and burn hamper the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Big and bold stuff from southern Spain with burnt, hot aromas of roasted black fruits and stems. Better on the palate, where it brings plum and berry flavors but also some heat and saline. Slightly stemmy and roasted on the finish, much like the bouquet.",Spain,Monastrell
"Gritty and tough, but amid the rough tannins and bite there is red plum, licorice candy and brown sugar sweetness. Flavors of berry fruit and raisin cover the racy and sweet ends of the spectrum, while the finish is tight to the point of being raw.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"An unusual blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Picapoll that hits with apple and melon aromas. The palate is soda-like, with zest, spritz and tangy lemon-lime and green apple flavors. Dry, pithy and a little strange in its flavor profile. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,White Blend
"Pungent and sweaty like Verdejo, and definitely not Albariño as we know it. This Castillian white starts out strong and sweaty, like hockey gear left too long in the bag. But the flavors of pink grapefruit, kiwi and lime are good, and the feel is fleshy if a bit flat. Finishes pithy and citric. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,White Blend
Not for everyone but not a bad sweet wine for desserts and cheeses. The nose is hard to describe but the palate and flavors are familiar: sweet applesauce and sugared pastry along with mango and candy. Decent acidity keeps it fresh and moving forward. Imported by Admiral Imports.,Spain,White Blend
"Earthy, leafy compost aromas are initially evident on the nose, and while the wine has some feel issue due to an abundance of raw tannins, it eventually rounds out and delivers oily, herbal flavors of blackberry and plum. Dark and muscular, but also aggressive and beefy. Seems a little untamed for a Telmo Rodriguez wine. Imported by Vintus LLC.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Tight on the nose, with dense aromas of black fruit, leather, dried cheese and earth. It's also fairly smoky and lively, with textured tannins, a generous mouthfeel and complex flavors of berry, pepper and spice. A lively, forward style made from Tempranillo, Graciano, Garnacha and Mazuelo.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"An endearing, balanced, controlled Toro with earthy aromas of blackberry jam, fine leather and mellow herbs. The palate is big, tannic and rock solid, while the flavors are perfectly approachable, sweet and tilt toward chocolate and blackberry. A bit creamy on the finish, with molasses and caramel. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Lacks freshness; pickled and leathery, with heavy, bruising tannins. Dull, pounding flavors of plum and prune are short and fierce. Rough country wine.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
Seems like it's past its sell-by date. Smells musky and tastes sweet and gummy. Candied papaya and mango is about all you get. Low-pulse stuff.,Spain,Pansa Blanca
"Vanilla wafer aromas leave this taster lost. The longer it airs out, the more weird the wine gets. Milk chocolate, vanilla and marshmallow dominate everything from aromas to feel to flavor to finish. A barrel-fermented rosé from Ribera Del Duero: why?",Spain,Rosé
"Probably not to everyone's liking, but this oak-fermented Verdejo is a bit like Burgundy and/or white Bordeaux. Cured meat, match stick and pineapple-lemon aromas work their way onto the mildly oaky nose, while the palate has a vanilla-based lushness that works well. Rich, opulent and classy. A sincere food wine.",Spain,Verdejo
"Grapefruit, melon, lime and match stick aromas give this Rueda a solid opening. The palate is fruity and a bit green and phenolic, with flavors of green melon, grass, cucumber and tangerine pith. Simple and clean on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Clean as polished glass, with touches of red plum and cherry on the nose. The palate is fresh and balanced, but basic and moderate in terms of flavors. Finishes with light cherry and raspberry notes. Garnacha with 30% white Viura. Imported by Admiral Imports. Best Buy.",Spain,Rosé
"If basic Argentinean Torrontés is to your liking, so will this be. It's fresh and green on the nose, with melon and lychee aromas. Those fruits carry onto the palate, where lemon-lime and crystallized mango flavors are sweet but crisped up by snappy acidity. Serve chilled. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,White Blend
"Big and baked, with aromas of cheese and leather offsetting sweet black fruit. Flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate are as baked and sweet as the nose, and the feel is grabby and leaves a sugary residue on the finish. Wants to be a modern, ripe wine but proves to be simple and overdone. Imported by The Portfolio Group.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of barrel spice and grilled pineapple are solid, while the palate is thick and creamy with orange marmalade and banana flavors. If you like a thick, unctuous Chard with a glob of oak, this is it. Has its strong points but tastes too much like cinnamon stick and wood. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Spice and leather aromas are positive while the smells of burnt leaves and green herbs aren't too appealing. The palate is big and wide with a mix of cherry cough drop, plum and burnt coffee flavors. And the finish evaporates fast, leaving heat and medicinal notes.",Spain,Red Blend
"Minty smelling, with herbal red fruit and rhubarb scents. The wine is clack, clack, clack on the palate as acids and snappy red fruit draw everything down to the base level. Flavors of raspberry and light vanilla are clean but high-toned, and there's an undercurrent of tomato. A tough wine from a vintage to forget.",Spain,Red Blend
"A touch green and grassy at the start, with cinnamon, cherry candy and red-fruit aromas. The palate is fresh and snappy, with sweet berry flavors and just a slight bit of resin and/or green character. Finishes light and quick, making it an easygoing red wine that isn't meant for deep analysis.",Spain,Garnacha
"Jammy smelling but also lean and minty. The palate is almost sour, a bit better later on, but never does it rise above tight, lean and tart. Mesache means youthful but youth is wasted on the young in this case. Garnacha, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and the indigenous Parraleta.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark and chunky, but also salinic and clammy smelling, with black fruit aromas sitting in front of a palate of salinic, woody, baked fruit flavors. The tannic finish is hard and edgy, and there's some heat too. Has its high and low points.",Spain,Monastrell
"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.",Spain,Albariño
"Light to medium aromas of cherry and berry are fresh and snappy, while the palate has high acidity, light extract and crisp, almost lean flavors of cherry and red plum. A pointed but clean wine that will do well with simple foods like sliced ham or salami.",Spain,Garnacha
"A touch green smelling, with aromas of coffee grinds and earth. Tannic in the mouth, and then hollow in the middle, with green-leaning, leafy flavors of blackberry and cola. Roasted on the finish, with burnt coffee and chewy, bitter tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rubber and plum aromas are accented by cinnamon spice notes on this fuller-sized, somewhat sticky but basic Garnacha. Dark in color and slightly herbal in terms of flavors, with tart cherry and a slightly dilute feel to the finish. Basic but honest.",Spain,Garnacha
"Basa has long been one of our go-to whites from Rueda, but this vintage seems to be on the slide. The nose is oily and short, while the fruit is turning toward bitter. It still has some vitality and green fruit character, but our advice is to wait for the 2009. A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo.",Spain,White Blend
"Light berry aromas carry a citrusy edge, while the crisp palate is lean but clean, with dry, peppery plum and cherry flavors. There's not too much body or complexity here; it's juicy, a little metallic and highly regular. 60% Tempranillo and 40% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Jammy smelling, with raisin and cough drop aromas. The palate maintains that jammy profile, while the flavors run creamy and short, with a lean toward strawberry and raspberry. A little grassy and green on the finish, with a final dose of candy.",Spain,Red Blend
"A tiny bit earthy and peppery, with solid berry fruit aromas. The palate is sappy and medium-weight, with red-fruit flavors dominated by raspberry. Shows a touch of mocha/chocolate on a dry, basic finish. Imported by Bourgeois Family Selections.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Definitely sweet, syrupy and raisiny. Torres has made a chunky, plodding wine with saturated berry and plum flavors but hardly any of the mineral, schist, zest and excitement the Priorat is renowned for. Deep, dark and dense for sure, but ultimately flabby and mediocre. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stretched on the nose, with reedy, wiry, candied red-fruit aromas. Quite tannic and a bit syrupy in the mouth, with ultrasweet berry flavors and then a scratchy, forward finish. Has its merits but seems out of place and pushy for Spain. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A decent old-school throwback, with dried spice, pepper and slight red-fruit aromas followed by a light-bodied palate of plum and raspberry. While it's mostly lean, there is the smallest note of caramel and toffee to the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A fleshy, simple wine with gumball aromas. The palate is chubby but not all that structured, with plump but basic berry and plum flavors. The finish shows some blackberry but not much else. Good and generally clean, but rudimentary. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Starts out pretty good and fruity, but becomes more challenged with time. There's a truckload of early raspberry fruit, but it turns more sharp and piercing the more time it sits. Lengthy and potent, but not elevated.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Sweet and syrupy, with molasses on the nose. On one hand it's rich, ripe and flavorful, but also cooked, lumpy and heavy. It's almost like a sweet red; sappy and made to be drunk soon.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A bit strange smelling for Rioja in that the nose deals a mix of candied berry aromas along with stemmy, herbal, compost notes. The palate is thick and chewy, while the flavor profile includes lightly baked, creamy berry and roasted accents. Stocky and fruity but with issues.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Starts out with gassy, earthy aromas that suggest heat and barnyard, while the palate is chunky and full, with stemmy black cherry, plum and berry flavors along with coffee and chocolate accents. Delivers power and length but not much in the way of character or complexity.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A mix of standard berry fruit and leafy, herbal qualities is the starting point. Next up is a tangy, acidic palate of red fruits, vanilla, acidity and ultimately some bitterness. Short and gritty on the finish. Tastes and smells like mass-market Bordeaux. A blend of 60% Tempranillo and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A tough wine to enjoy. The nose has a cheesy top layer, while the base aromas are of bell pepper and lettuce. It's very tangy and juicy in the mouth, with searing red-cherry flavors and green accents. Snappy and whispy to the max.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ripe, dense and powerful, with on onslaught of raisin, spice, pepper and leather on the nose. The palate is direct and pure, with clean flavors of berry, spice and chocolate leading to a long, layered finish. Beautiful wine; one of the best I've had from this region. 70% Monastrell with 20% Cabernet and 10% Syrah.",Spain,Red Blend
"A slightly murky and chemical-smelling wine with a nose of rubber band, beets, red fruits and licorice. It's sweet and roasted in the mouth, with molasses and raisin flavors. Hard tannins and a gritty finish make it a tough run. The winery is trying to make something good and elevated, but the vintage (hot) didn't comply.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"Nobody ever said Yecla in southern Spain is Sauvignon Blanc country, but here is proof that the grape does exist there. The wine is generally clean and floral, with tart apple and citrus flavors heading straight to a pithy, driving, slightly bitter finish. Shows good verve but comes up a little empty. Imported by Marquee Artisan Wines.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"The nose is heavy and dosed with burnt rubber and leather, but the palate fares better, with cherry and raspberry flavors and a pretty clean and clear mouthfeel. A simple but sound wine with a slight resiny green character but mostly it shows decent red fruit with mild sweetness. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Garnacha
"Early match-stick aromas fade and give way to scents of white fruits and wisteria flower. The plump palate offers papaya, peach and nectarine flavors, while the finish dries out quickly, leaving a slight pithy bitterness. A little bland but still pretty good. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",Spain,White Blend
"Rather oily and hard on the nose, with dried cheese, brett, mint and black fruit. The palate is rich and extremely forward, and the flavors are sweet but not that substantive or complex. Chocolate and mocha on the finish are about as much carry-through as you get.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rather baked and heavy, with chunky black fruit and chocolate on the nose. First in line on the palate is raisin and prune, while in back of that there's vanilla, dill and brown sugar. With grating tannins and excess weight, this one has balance issues while still offering some good looks at Ribera del Duero. Imported by Admiral Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Hot, earthy aromas settle on leather and tomato, while the palate is gritty and tastes of dark, smoky, chunky black fruit. More tangy and angular on the finish than desirable, with limited depth. Standard stuff on its best day.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Warm and smelling of menthol, cough syrup and sweet, jammy berry fruit. The palate is also fairly medicinal in terms of flavor, while the feel is a bit hard and underdeveloped. Turns more tart and herbal the more you get to know it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stemmy and leathery smelling, with heat, roasted fruit and cheesy aromas. The palate is full but soupy, with roasted, baked black fruit flavors. A bit of cinnamon and spice help out the finish, but by then the wine's very average fate has been sealed.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A little burnt and leathery smelling, with stem, bramble and raspberry aromas. The palate is sheering and tight, with semisharp acidity enlivening herbal, peppery red fruit flavors. As a whole, there isn't a lot of substance here to weigh.",Spain,Garnacha
"Clearly this isn't a vintage for long keeping. In fact, one of our usual favorite Ruedas is already on the downslide. The nose is chunky pineapple and the palate is dull and wayward, with flat, pithy citrus. Lacks the vibrancy José Pariente is know for. Wait for the 2009.",Spain,Verdejo
"The previous two years we did not find this wine to be worthy of a rating. This time, we rate it but note that it's an almost-red wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon. It's sweet smelling, with fiery plum-skin flavors that evaporate along with the mouthfeel. Leaves a burn patch on the finish. Particular to the max.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Super pungent and forceful, with extreme aromas of grapefruit, nettle and sweat. Aggressive and spritzy feeling, with tangy lemon-lime flavors accented by a dose of sweeter tangerine. Citric at all points. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Sauvignon
"Peppery and lightly herbal on the nose, with a whiff of dry red fruits. The palate is pretty snappy and angular, however, the red-fruit flavors mixed with pepper and spice ring true. Finishes dry without a whole lot of carry. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Smells a little fiery, although you do get decent cherry and raspberry from the nose. Solid enough in the mouth, with ripe plum and black cherry flavors in front of a candied, vanilla-ladened finish. Pretty good, with commercially viable sweetness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A hint of burnt leaves and compost draws down the bouquet, but overall this is a decent $9 wine. It's crisp, acidic and a little stemmy, but amid the leanness it also has an appealing fresh quality that emphasizes red fruit, pepper and snap.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Given the price, this wine is more than acceptable and may even be pleasing for those not seeking greatness. It is punchy and grapey, with a bit of dried cheese on the nose along with berry and plum. It's sizable, loud, concentrated and tastes pretty good. Among $7 wines, it's recommended.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of berry fruits, coconut and leather add up well, but the wine falls off in the mouth, where it's sweet, gummy and jacked up. Very tannic and compact in terms of feel, with a hard finish anchored by serious tannins. Fruity and forward but lacking balance. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Big and heavy, with forceful aromas of shoe polish, tar and balsam wood. It's saturated and dense in the mouth, but the cherry and blackberry flavors are tart and underdeveloped. And the finish falls off fast. Imported by Baron Francois Ltd.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Char-accented wild berry and plum aromas go straight into a bright, edgy palate of cherry and plum, and overall this is a simple, slightly candied Garnacha that has some sizzle and burn to it. Racy and the slightest bit green at its core.",Spain,Garnacha
"A heavy aromatic dose of funk, bramble and rubber is what greets you, and that reduced awkwardness never leaves the wine. Size and in-your-face leather and animal notes are dominant traits, and only below that do you find blackberry, plum and any mellowness. A good mouthfeel is the wine's saving grace. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Minty and herbal smelling, with stemmy, generic fruit aromas. The palate is sticky and creamy, while the flavors are chunky, flat and lean toward herbal berry. An oaky, syrupy wine with a mild green streak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flat and fleshy smelling, with little zap and only soft green fruit aromas. The palate maintains some tang and citrus, while flavors of lemon and tangerine are chunky, loud and lean toward bitter on the finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Pineapple aromas lead to a soft, smooth, but lifeless palate of slightly bitter melon and banana flavors. Pithy on the finish and short on pulse. Drink immediately or let it go by altogether.",Spain,Verdejo
"Nothing special about this blend of Tempranillo and Shiraz. In fact, it's more austere and less pleasing than the brand's basic 2007 Temp-Shiraz blend. That said, this wine shows thin raspberry flavors and a tangy, almost sour back end. Probably best with food; not real good on its own.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Cherry and mild sawdust aromas are brought down by sharpness that is almost vinegar-like. The palate has an acceptable mouthfeel along with sweet and sour flavors of plum and berry. Tart on the finish, and a bit stemmy and sharp throughout.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earth, rubber and chunky black fruit aromas make for a heavy, muddled nose, while the medium-sized palate is stewy and briary, with jammy flavors of red fruits and rubber. More stewed and medicinal than anything.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pungent up front, with dry bayberry, leather, jam notes and schisty minerality. The palate is all about structure, snappy acids, sinewy tannins and lively, full-force red-fruit and plum flavors. Like in the past, this is a top-notch Priorato that holds its form through the acid-driven finish. Best from 2011–2015.",Spain,Red Blend
"With spice, raisin and driving dark-fruit aromas, this sweetie is lifted and enticing on the bouquet. Big, rowdy and complex in the mouth, with layered cherry, cough drop and kirsch flavors. Very pure late, with coffee, chocolate and even more spice to the finish. Shows good fruit, acids, heft and overall balance. Delicious and highly recommended.",Spain,Red Blend
"Lower in price than Cenit's Old Vines, but to me this is a better, more open wine with bacon, spice and bold black-fruit aromas. The palate is full but retains finesse as well as big tannins; flavors of black fruits come with chocolate, coffee and spice. Full-force stuff but still fairly refined. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark, condensed and inky, with big, muscular aromas of charcoal, cassis liqueur, blackberry and tar. The palate is just lush enough despite being staunch and tannic, and the flavors of black fruit and cassis are luscious and sweet, with a bit of lemony oak adding zest. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"The wine's tan-gold color tells you that it's fading, the aromas of canned pineapple are not particularly fresh, and the finish is fleshy and fat. Imported by Alconde Vineyards, LLC.",Spain,Verdejo
"Best early and then it shows its lesser pedigree later on. Early aromas of ripe berry fruit aren't bad before they shift to measurably jumpy and edgy. There's black cherry candy flavors and then snap, crackle and pop on the tongue. Good for the price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Seems sort of waxy and baked, with mildly acrid aromas of burnt corn leading the way. The palate has an o.k. feel but the flavors are rather bitter and burnt, and the fruit isn't pointed or expressive. May already be past its prime. Imported by Winery Exchange.",Spain,Verdejo
"Opens with dried red fruit and cinnamon aromas, but after that the mouth is creamy and grabby, with bland fruit and then a wave of vanilla cream and milk chocolate on the finish. A sticky wine that doesn't fully pass the balance test.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Not bad on the nose, where strawberry and cream aromas are doused a bit by a burnt-field smell. In the mouth, it's snappy and elastic, with tart flavors of apple, underripe nectarine and grapefruit. Finishes lean and crisp, without much personality. Imported by Testa Wines Of The World.",Spain,Rosé
"Pleasant but very basic, with a nose of dry cherry and a palate that's crisp, lean and features flavors of tart plum and cherry. A decidedly crisp and lean style of Rioja, with no richness to speak of save for a hint of butter on the finish. Imported by Classic Wines, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Starts out on shaky ground with coconut and chemical aromas. In the mouth, it hits very hard with cola, raisin and cherry flavors. Falls flat and empty on the finish, and as a whole it seems overdone. Seems like a novelty, and at $36 it fails to impress.",Spain,Petite Verdot
"Roll out the barrel, or the staves, or the oak dust, or whatever it is that gives this modest Chardonnay such an overpowering wood element. Amid all the toast and burnt popcorn there's honey, butter, baked white fruits and pretty good core acidity. Imported by JNJ International Inc.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Stemmy and rough out of the blocks, with aromas of rubber and strawberry. Seems grabby in the mouth due to rather rough tannins and high acidity, and overall the wine seems forced but lacking in the essentials. Quite expensive given the result. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With tobacco, licorice, herbs, bell pepper and carob, there's a bit of everything to this Navarran Cabernet. The palate is thick and chewy, but it's also sticky and very tannic. Flavors run toward vegetal and green, with clove, burnt sugar and roasted fruit. Heat and molasses work the finish of this beefy beast that lacks clarity.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"Sharp, medicinal and a little skunky to start with, and it remains acidic, tangy and hard in the mouth, with cranberry and cough medicine for flavors. Herbal and cutting on the finish. Not much to write home about.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells like wet cement, spearmint and light red fruits. The palate is dilute and acidic, with tangy, citrusy flavors of raspberry and cherry. Citric on the finish as well, although on the plus side you could say it's crisp and mostly fresh.",Spain,Tempranillo
"While this wine doesn't really appeal to us, we can envision fans of Old World, leaner, more acidic wines signing on. What we see, however, is a light-bodied, high-acid wine with tart, lean raspberry and cherry skin flavors and a sour finish. Fresh for sure, but hollow and in need of more.",Spain,Monastrell
"Gassy smelling and candied on the nose, with medicinal, jumpy cherry aromas. The palate is hot and hard, with underwhelming, semisour plum and berry flavors. Herbal on the back end, with a weak, faux buttery aftertaste.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Green to the point of being vegetal, with bell pepper and green bean aromas in addition to hidden berry fruit. It's grabby and tannic across the palate, while the flavors run toward green fruit and caramel. Deficient and hard as nails.",Spain,Tempranillo
"As in previous years, this wine just isn't that fresh and pure. The nose is briney, and the palate follows suit. There's some chunky grapefruit to ponder, but there's unavoidable pickled, vegetal notes come finishing time.",Spain,Rosé
"Tight, pure and just right from start to finish. The nose offers bold berry, roasted plum, vanilla and spice aromas along with exceptional clarity, and the palate is snappy and pure but also dark and loaded with coffee, chocolate, mocha and fine raspberry and cherry flavors. Slightly oaky but smooth late, and composed. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little heavy at first, but airing reveals a robust and stirring bouquet of plum and berry aromas mixed with coffee and leather. The palate is pure and deep, with a lush set of blackberry, ripe plum and berry syrup flavors. Shows a fine structure, a long and warm finish, and the potential to age another 5–8 years.",Spain,Red Blend
"Golden brown in color, with smooth, almondy aromas along with apricot, cinnamon and toffee. The palate is full, round, smooth and satisfying, with a fine blend of weight, acidity and prime Sherry flavors. Overall this is a rich, heady style of dry Amontillado that finishes long and secure.",Spain,Sherry
"Mature, classy and different than most, with earth, tobacco, warm fruit, baked notes and subtlety to the bouquet. The palate is whole, welcoming and full of baked plum, spice, molasses and leathery, and then it finish long and complex, but a little sweet and rooty. A winner from Mallorca for those seeking something different. Drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"A mixture of tomato, jammy red fruit, alcohol and grit gives this four-grape, Garnacha-led blend a tough path to hoe. In the mouth, the fruit is shrill as it settles on raspberry and cherry, while the feel and length are short. Hits the palate then it's gone in a flash.",Spain,Red Blend
"With basic pear, green melon and other sweet aromas, the nose is controlled. But the palate on this white Garnacha is dry and soda-like, with seltzer-like flavors touched up by citrus. Decent but bland. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Spain,Garnacha
"Standard berry along with warm, earthy aromas give it some size, and the palate shows medium-bodied raspberry and strawberry flavors. There's a forward, semiracy feel to it, but in the end there isn't a whole lot of finish, flavor or finesse.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Modest fruit aromas and a touch earthy and burnt smelling, with lively, somewhat tart raspberry and plum flavors. A bit of vanilla and caramel comes on late, and overall this ranks as a standard, lean-style Rioja. Imported by Admiral Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rhubarb and brambly black cherry aromas set up sweet, candied, fairly forced red-berry flavors that have a green element and a slightly cloying feel. The palate has some weight and creaminess to it, but also the sugary feel you get when eating cotton candy.",Spain,Garnacha
"Neutral smelling, with a hint of pool water to the nose. The palate delivers a strange combination of mustard and white grapefruit, and the finish is pithy to the extreme and mildly bitter. The blend is the uncommon mix of Sauvignon Blanc and Macabeo (Viura). Imported by Spanish Vines, Inc.",Spain,White Blend
"Aromas of strawberry, cassis and mocha are brought down a notch by vegetal notes, while the palate is heavier than the winery's straight-ahead Tempranillo. Flavors of plum and boysenberry are chunky and quick to fade, and green notes reappear on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Same score as the prior vintage, and pretty much the same tart wine. It's red in color, sweet and candied on the nose, and awkward in general. And then it's citric and sour in the mouth, with flavors of pink grapefruit. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Seems like the hot sun of central Spain got to this three-grape blend because it's undeniably sweet and baked. The aromas are pure raisin, while the palate is drawn down and syrupy. Too thick and sweet for its own good.",Spain,Red Blend
"Starts with pine, saline and berry candy aromas and it settles on sweet and jumpy. Juicy as can be and very lively, but also short, choppy, sweet and with a bubble gum character.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Candied on one hand but also gassy, barnyardy and less than clean and pure on the other. A basic mouthfeel is probably the high point, while flavors of underdeveloped berry fruit are more salty and leathery than anything. Fails to impress.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Funky smelling and unfamiliar, with sweet, candied spice notes and strange candied cherry aromas. Vibrant and bouncy in terms of feel, but follows the nose by tasting sweet and weird. Weak on the finish as well.",Spain,Garnacha
"Smells like compost, and never does that earthy, stenchiness lift. The palate is thick and muddled, with wan, dry, buttery raspberry flavors that lack direction. Finishes dry and bland, without much structure.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells candied as well as burnt and stemmy. The palate is adequate on the surface but hollow in the middle, with dry, herbal raspberry flavors. Tastes more stemmy and distracted the longer you play with it. Not ready for prime time.",Spain,Monastrell
"Dull aromas of raspberry and plum skins turn sweeter with air, but the palate is too centered on thick, creamy, generic berry flavors that turn raisiny and chunky with time. Not grabby or cloying, but even so this wine doesn't hit many high notes.",Spain,Monastrell
"Jammy, sweet and extremely raisiny, with a nose that matches the palate. Low in acid, so low in pulse. Pruney on the finish and seemingly overripe. Not well balanced.",Spain,Garnacha
"Colorful but aromatically defined by lean, green alfalfa, which doesn't portend much good. The palate is hard and underwhelming, with herbal, almost green berry fruit flavors. Similar on the finish. A 200,000-case product that comes across like a 200,000-case product.",Spain,Red Blend
"Only if you enjoy very lean, ultrafresh and tart red wines will this work. It starts with simple punchbowl aromas of red grapes and berry, and then comes a skinny, tart, grating palate that's all acid and no substance. Calling it “traditional” or a “terroir” wine would only be misleading.",Spain,Monastrell
"A weird wine in every way. The nose smells like something off the grid, with briney fruit, funky spice notes and compost. Creamy and oaky in the mouth, with herbal flavors and a dash of nutmeg and/or cardamom. Hard on the finish, and just too strange to bother with.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A burnt, stemmy nose is an indicator of what's to some. And while the palate has an o.k. feel to it, the flavors here are bitter, herbal and burnt. A wine that lacks freshness of fruit.",Spain,Monastrell
"Smells slightly exotic and different from the norm; the nose offers baked black-fruit scents, lemon peel, rubber and Eastern spices. Pure and driving on the palate, with good acidity and woodsy, complex flavors of blackberry, coffee and licorice. Snappy and pure on the finish; drink from 2011 through 2016.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Meaty, spicy and smooth on the nose, with subtle dryness that indicates maturity. The palate is saturated but not heavy or chewy, with body and balance that highlights plum, berry, cherry and toasty oak and spice flavors. Shows freshness, health, quality and finesse. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice and bronze, with nutty, potent aromas that are forward and chiseled. Lively, clipped and zesty in the mouth, with nutty pecan, toasted almonds, lemon zest and length. A powerful Sherry that represents the Palo Cortado category with aplomb.",Spain,Sherry
"Immediately this wine plays soft and raisiny. The nose has a stout molasses component, and the palate is sweet and vanilla-infused. A sticky strawberry flavor is sweetened up by coconut and vanilla on the finish. Not well balanced. Imported by Quintessential Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark fruit aromas come with a grainy, almost chemical side, while the palate feels gritty as it pushes licorice and black cherry flavors. Rubbery and without much finish. Imported by American Northwest Distributors Inc.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Thin and saline on the nose, with a chemical-chlorine smell. The palate is fairly sour and raw, with tough tannins and a killer grip. As a whole, the mid-level flavors don't taste like much, and the finish is clamp-down tight.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
Decent aromas but overly acidic and astringent. The cherry flavor is so sour that any vanilla or oak that may come on late can't save the day. Imported by Baron Francois Ltd.,Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lacquer and apple cider aromas lead to a sticky, sweet palate. There's a citric edge to it but mostly it's just sweet and tastes like orange slices and jelly beans. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Red licorice candy on the nose is the only sign of life. Otherwise it's just sour and dried-out, with flavors of citrus and plum skins. Past its prime.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Not much good to say here. Burnt, weak aromas include raspberry, while the acidic palate tastes of cherry and plum skins. Lean and tart-sour all the way.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Has some serious cleanliness issues on the nose, and while it's not entirely unpalatable, it does struggle to make many positive statements. Tastes flat, mealy and bitter, and there's even some burn to it. Imported by Scoperta Importing Co. Inc.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Stemmy, brambly raspberry aromas lead to a scouring, light palate of snappy, sharp-tasting red cherry and plum-skin flavors. Lean to the point that it's almost sour, and overall it's stretched extremely thin.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Burnt smelling at first, and tart throughout, with pie cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors. There's not much to measure here; the wine runs sour and tastes mostly of red fruit skins and citric acid. 65% Tempranillo and 35% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Way too charred and roasted. The mouthfeel is acceptable and ranks as the best part of the wine. The rest is just a burnt, charred, overoaked mess with flavors of earthy berry, leather, peanut and resin. A poor effort that makes you wonder what the winery was thinking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flat and gaseous smelling, with sulfur and no fruit to speak of. Tastes like bland nectarine and tangerine, and the body and finish are almost flabby. Borderline in terms of its acceptability.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"Soft, chunky and fading fast, with aromas of asparagus and canned green beans. The palate is flat as a board, with vegetal flavors and bitterness on the finish. Barely worth a sip at this point in its evolution.",Spain,Verdejo
"If it weren't for the wine's stout color and pretty good mouthfeel, we'd sink it. The nose is green and cheesy, and the flavors are also green almost to the point of vegetal. Stemmy on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Heavy and definitely on the mealy side of the fence, and fighting for any semblance of balance. Pithy as well. Sadly, the citrus fruit in this wine is not that appealing.",Spain,Godello
"Quite sweaty, oily and hard, almost like an underdeveloped Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is also on the bitter, oily, pithy side, with only a little grapefruit and orange working their way through.",Spain,White Blend
"Stocky, dark and pure, with inky aromas of shoe polish, black fruits and charcoal. The palate is brawny and tannic, with saturated blackberry, espresso and bitter chocolate flavors. It's rowdy but also attractive and full of everything good including chocolate, spice and pepper on the finish. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Green and hard, with carob and ashtray aromas. The palate is simple and narrow, with sour red-fruit flavors that come to a slightly bitter ending. A defining combination of tartness and bubble gum dust isn't impressive.",Spain,Red Blend
"Reasonably fresh on the nose, but ultranarrow and tart in the mouth. In fact, it's borderline sour in the way it presents such linear red fruit. Tight as a drum and sheering. Can't say this is what we want from La Mancha.",Spain,Shiraz
"Herbal, green and grassy, with less than fresh fruit character. The palate has a weedy taste, while the finish is green and peppery. Edgy mouthfeel; barely acceptable red wine for the second straight vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of bold black cherry, leather, bacon and sandalwood scream “modern,” yet its age renders it a bit classical. The palate is mildly woody but the flavors or creamy vanilla, dill and balsamic berry fruits are excellent. Toasty and full of coffee and depth on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little tight on the nose, with earthy characteristics as well as raspberry and plum aromas. The palate is juicy and offers good flow, while the flavors of raspberry and plum are classic and touched up by vanilla, spice, dill and toastiness. Long on the finish, with tobacco, spice and cocoa. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Very pretty aromatics of blackberry, vanilla, tobacco, spice and coffee draw you in. The palate is lush and deep, with black fruit, cola and integrated spice flavors. Concentrated and smooth, and already approachable with roasted fig and an extra dose of black fruit on the finish. Drink from 2011–2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Warm and smooth, with aromas of fresh dill, spiced cherries, mulled earth and more. The palate has a full, stacked feel with well-oaked flavors of vanilla, toffee and earthy berries. Finishes chewy, with complexity and light flavors of caramel and tobacco. Ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"Super smooth and complete on the nose, with black fruit, toasty oak and earth notes rolled into a nice whole. It's lush, plump and balanced, with full blackberry, raisin, chocolate and spice flavors resting in front of a mellow, spicy finish. A pretty, balanced blend of 75% Tempranillo and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon that shows Jumilla at its best.",Spain,Red Blend
"Códax really got it good in 2007. This is one of this co-op's best-balanced, easy-to-like bottlings we can remember. The bouquet is clean as a whistle, with pear, apple and slate. Graceful on the palate, with citrus and green-apple flavors. A little lime carves shape into the long finish. Imported by Martín Códax USA.",Spain,Albariño
"There's a nice shine to this slightly sweet but solid rosé out of Navarra. The bouquet is fresh for the most part, while the palate offers lively raspberry, citrus and melon flavors. A touch of residual sugar is sweetening things up, but overall it's very drinkable. Open right away or wait for the 2008 to arrive next summer.",Spain,Garnacha
"If the choice is between sleek packaging and good product, take the product every time. And with Garnacha de Fuego, the product is sound to the point of surprising. A bouquet of huge berry aromas is the opening act, followed by flavors of red apple, kirsch and plum. Offers lots of fruit in front of a short, simple finish. And then it's time to open another bottle.",Spain,Garnacha
"Muga always makes a solid, clear-style rosé, and this one fits that mold. It's light in color, with peach, melon and mineral on the clean, steely bouquet. Narrow on the palate, with peach and citrus flavors. Shows a sly touch and will work with food.",Spain,Rosé
"Not overly fruity up front; instead there's a strong hint of lettuce, greens and peach pit on the bouquet. The palate is more round and giving, with a tropical blend of pineapple, citrus and apple flavors. Finishes dry and firm, making it perfectly good in the $12-and-under category.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Subtle aromas of white fruits, talc and powdered sugar are totally what they should be given that this is an extra dry Cava. The palate is a little sudsy and active, but the flavors of citrus and white pepper are balanced and not overly sweet or confected. Shows good clarity from start to finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Clean, minerally, slightly green in aromatics and oh so approachable and nice. For an under-$15 white, this Godello from Monterrei excels with layered flavors of apple, minerals and natural spice. The finish is long and hints at fresh herbs like thyme and tarragon. Potentially superb with garlic shrimp or calamari over fresh greens.",Spain,Godello
"Rooty, warm and leathery at first, and then it really rounds into form. This Garnacha-led multigrape blend is a pretty, earthy, stylish wine that's at peak maturity. It brings baked, rich black cherry, cola and toffee flavors and then a finish of coffee and toast. A bit syrupy but still excellent and ready now.",Spain,Red Blend
"White pear, melon and almond skin aromas are good and correct, while the peachy palate has roundness and interesting flavors of orange, lime and nectarine. Crisp, precise and well-glued together, with harmony throughout. A textbook food-friendly white that's more interesting than other Rías Baixas wines due to the addition of Loureira and Caiño Blanco to traditional Albariño.",Spain,White Blend
"Roasted and baked on first blush, but then the wine's complexity and use of unusual Mallorcan grape varieties take over. Along the way there's flavors and aromas of prune, earth, leather, spice and Mediterranean terroir. It's also bringing tobacco and leaf notes to the table. A fun, different wine that goes nicely with tapas. Drink now through 2011–12.",Spain,Red Blend
"Deep and dark, with fruitcake, black fruit and chocolate aromas. The wine has vibrancy and depth, which are the keys to getting the so-called “modern formula” right. Flush and ripe in terms of mouthfeel, with black plum, bitter chocolate and fine coffee flavors on the plump finish. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of rubber, leafy red fruit and herbal raspberry are solid. It's crisp in the mouth, with raspy tannins supporting tight cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes like it flows, with firm acidity and zest more than richness, leaving a hint of creamy vanilla and heat as it fades away.",Spain,Red Blend
"Muga has crafted a steely, no-fat Viura (with 10% Malvasia), despite the wine being fermented in barrel. The nose is clean and passive, while the palate is crisp and tight but largely neutral in its delivery of apple and lemon flavors. From a cool vintage, this wine is like kissing the razor's edge. Good stuff but limited in what it has in store.",Spain,Viura
"The unheralded Tarragona D.O. delivers a basic winner in this varietal Tempranillo. It comes out of the gate well, with deep cherry, kirsch and coffee aromas. The palate falls off a touch from the promise of the bouquet, but overall the wine is generous and fruity and sincere. More balanced and complex than one might expect from a Catalonian value-priced red.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Citrusy on the nose, with just a hint of sulfuric burn and smoke. Flavors of sweet white grapefruit, tangerine and tarragon leaf give the palate that little bit extra, while the finish is smooth but short. Good but a touch flat on the back end and finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Both Freixenet and its sister property Segura Viudas put out myriad Cavas in this price and quality range. This one shows cherry candy on the nose and some seltzer. The palate is balanced between sweet red fruit and citrus, while the finish is dry despite some earlier sweetness. Bouncy and nice for a Pinot Noir Cava.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Nothing outrageous but this Garnacha, which now has a little age on it, is more than satisfying. The nose delivers cherry, plum and even a little cookie, while the savory palate features molasses, plum and spice. Subtle, composed and sort of old-school. Drink now.",Spain,Garnacha
"Pure and forward, with minerally aromas of citrus, grapefruit and wet stone. For basic Verdejo, this is head and shoulders above most; it bursts with fresh orange, grapefruit, green apple and peach, and the finish is pure and long. So tasty and super easy to like; a highly recommended go-to value white.",Spain,Verdejo
"A smoky number with vibrant aromas of dried fruits mixed with campfire and molasses. It's integrated and spicy, with cherry, apple-peel and other attractive secondary flavors. With no shortage of power and fine tannins, this wine is approaching its peak and should be good for another five years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Not many wines of this price are pulling legit 90-point scores. But this one deserves it. The wine delivers citrus and piquant green-fruit aromas, which are backed by honeyed melon and lime flavors. The texture is just soft enough to not bite, while the finish is wavy. 10,000 cases made.",Spain,Verdejo
"Rubbery, meaty and fully ripe smelling: that's the nose on this round and dark Monastrell. Yet while it hints at being bold and burly, the palate is more restrained and subtle. Don't expect a ton of stuffing, and instead look for savory plum and olive flavors in front of a short, stout finish. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Monastrell
"There's nothing not to like about this affordable Spanish bubbly. The nose is a little candied and shy, but it's pleasant overall. The palate foams a bit more than a stately Cava might, but the flavors of pear, apple and grapefruit are honest. Fresh yet soft, simple and easygoing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Good but basic wine from southern Spain that shows cherry aromas with a citrusy twist. The mix is Monastrell with Syrah and Tempranillo, and as a whole it is composed, with berry, plum and other straightforward flavors. A plump, friendly sort of wine that isn't too complicated.",Spain,Red Blend
"Campo de Borja's “everyman's” red rides again in 2007. Sure, it's sweet and candied, but that's the 75% Garnacha talking. Flavors of berry, plum and chocolate are bold and forward, though not very complex. Seems more lush and heavy than in the past. Good for those who don't want to think much about what they're drinking.",Spain,Red Blend
"Slightly more chunky and dusty than lively, with dry apple aromas and not much else. The palate offers a medium level of intensity and flavors of melon, banana and white pepper. Turns drier and more soda-like on the finish. Good but a little short on flavor.",Spain,Albariño
"A little cloudy and minty, with aromas of herbs and reeds bumping up against cherry cough drop. That medicinal cherry flavor joins plum and light pepper, while the feel is lively, bracing and forward. Gets better with airing, and overall it tastes a little more natural than some Jumilla heavyweights.",Spain,Monastrell
"Stylistically speaking, this oak-aged wine is very different from all of Borsao's fruit-first Garnachas. And that isn't exactly a full-out compliment. So while the wine has balance and structure, the oak seems dominant on the nose and palate, which lends more vanilla and cream than spice and character.",Spain,Red Blend
"Quintessential value wine from Spain is what you're getting with Viña Borgia's 100% Garnacha. The nose is candied for sure, but it settles to show the upside of Grenache rather than the weaker, more remedial side. Flavors of bright cherry and raspberry are high-toned and pure, and the finish offers a little pepper and edge.",Spain,Garnacha
"A tough, sun-belted wine with concentration, big tannins and a ton of power and flavor. The nose is all bacon, balsamic notes, tobacco and roasted black fruit, while the ridged palate is dark and tastes of blackberry, molasses, coconut and brown sugar. Edgy, lemony and tannic on the finish. Drink now with beef; can be held for another 3–5 years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Brawny but lovely, with monster black fruit, balsam wood, tobacco and cola nut aromas. The palate is ultra rich and modern in style, with deep, brandied flavors of cola, black cherry and spice. Driven, modern and properly tannic, with a fair amount of mocha and creaminess on the finish. Drink from late 2010 thru 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ginger ale and a touch of powdered sugar give this extra dry Cava its proper sweet aromas. The flavors are solid, if you like candied orange slices and lemon-lime soda. Shows good mouthfeel and more than adequate freshness. Perfectly competent given that it's $9.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The bouquet delivers some of that creamy, corn-like smell that many Cavas show. There is also cereal and citrus to the nose. Flavors of nectarine, grapefruit and green herbs are fresh and in the lead, and the feel is soft-edged. Shows some green bitterness on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Probably not a Cava for wine snobs. But who says all wines have to be super serious and complex? This one shows cured meat, tarragon, sweet tea and Muscat aromas, while the flavors are pure lychee and honeydew. Frothy and sugary, but that's the spumante style. Best with birthday cake, etc.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"From the Freixenet group of wineries, Vionta is clean but more neutral than we'd like to see. You won't be offended by the wine's green apple and lemon flavors, which are wet, fresh and zesty. But you might like a touch more refinement and dimension. A good wine, but a basic one.",Spain,Albariño
"Gets off early with fresh tomato, spiced red plum, tobacco and vanilla aromas. The palate is fine but tight, with herbal fruit flavors, pepper, tomato and sharp acidity. Finishes with olive and tomato notes. Not the sweetest or softest thing going, but good if you like Navarran wines and their patented herbal, red-fruit character.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Baked, earthy and leathery, just like all the AN wines. But there's also a smooth intersection of the old and new worlds here; it's one part rooty, oaky and rich but also dry, leathery and indigenous to the Balearics (the base grape is Callet). Finishes a little sweet and warm, and thus it's begging to be drunk now.",Spain,Red Blend
"A more traditional type of crianza with vanilla, spice, dry berry fruit and a quiet, subtle approach. The mouthfeel is Old World with it's clean, dusty weight and proper acid-tannin balance, and the flavors of spice, cherry, dried currant and earth don't overstep their place. Very nice wine for under $20.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice, clean and vibrant, with a welcoming set of peach, apricot and citrusy aromas. The wine is 100% correct and fresh, with clarity and flavors of apple, peach and green grapes. Shows just enough body, acid and pith on the finish, but drink now before it starts to fade.",Spain,Albariño
"Deep and dark as night, with a lake's worth of cassis and black fruit aromas. There is no interference here; just pure, big-boned, modern-style Tempranillo flavors of currants, blackberry and soft, cuddly oak. Finishes with cream and coconut, but length and power as well. Hold until late 2010 and drink through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Huge wine with sweetness and smooth qualities from head to toe. Aromas of mint leaf, pastry and sweet black fruits are magnetic, while the lush, layered palate is complete and packed with berry fruit, toast, fudge and tobacco flavors. Layered and deep on the finish, with cola, herbs and licorice notes. Beautiful wine. Drinkable now and good through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A slightly heavier version of Verdejo, especially given 2007's cool conditions in Rueda. The wine has waxy peach and papaya aromas follwed by apricot, pineapple and mango flavors. It definitely opens on the palate and then finishes with a fleshy texture, additional fruit and even some nuts. Good complexity yet still a forward type of white wine.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dry, smoky and showing a touch of leather, this is a smooth crianza with bright berry flavors, a bit of heft, and well-applied oak that doesn't overwhelm. Black cherry and raspberry flavors are bright, and the vanilla and butter elements are controlled and should subside in due time. Drink now into 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The nose delivers a light but perceptible blast of sucking candy, children's vitamin and perfume aromas. The palate shows additional candied characteristics, but for the most part it's fresh and easy, with a good feel. Generic as a whole, but competent and satisfying.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The smell of honey and lemon-lime soda give this a basic but respectable opening. It's sort of foamy and plump in the mouth, with apple and green-herb flavors. Lacks a little touch but offers bouncy fruit and no overt faults. Imported by Winelink Imports.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The neon pink color is a dead giveaway that Garnacha is the basis of this rosé. Smells spunky and quite fresh on the nose, with a touch of bubble-gum sweetness. Flavors of raspberry and cotton candy catch the tart and sweet sides of things, so overall it's offering a little of everything. Drink now.",Spain,Rosé
"A little aggressive out of the chute, with a nose that's sort of raspy. The fruit on the palate is tangy and tastes like early picked nectarines with a lemon twist. Crisp and short, but very clean and focused.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Salmon-colored and dense, with aromas of clay, cherry and brown sugar. Pinot Noir-ish in its smoky, dried-berry palate and peppery finish. Robust, solid and with texture.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Age is beginning to show up on this gran reserva. It's a little raisiny and Sherried on the nose, while the palate is wiry but not exactly thin, with dry raspberry, pie cherry and plum skin flavors. Baked bean, caramel, vanilla and tobacco all play big roles on the finish, which is scouring and tight. Drink now; it's probably not going to improve with further age.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of cherry-chocolate and rubber are firm and a little closed. And such a bouquet doesn't really portend a flavor profile dominated by pink grapefruit and tight citrus. But that's really where this Cava rests: in the mouth, it's single-mindedly about pink grapefruit, which is fine if that's a flavor you like.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Savory and deep given the price, with dark color, obvious ripeness and even a touch of vanilla and mocha on the nose. Round in the mouth and immensely fruity, with plum and berry flavors blending with vanilla. Textured and medium-long on the finish. Good for everyday quaffing, especially in the cold fall and winter months.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Interesting and very much showing Navarran qualities, including aromas of black olive, herbs and mossy fruit. The palate has good structure, balance and feel, and thus there's a nice platform for dry black cherry, cassis and mocha flavors. As an '05 it's evolved, still fresh enough, and ready to go.",Spain,Red Blend
"Crisp, clean and minerally on the nose, with apple and green-fruit aromas. It has a round, smooth feel and flavors of peach, apple and citrus that will enliven the palate and aid almost any seafood, vegetable or salad. A natural wine with just enough powdery sweetness to raise a smile.",Spain,Albariño
"Very solid and sturdy, with aromas of apple, lemon-lime, soda cracker and mineral. The palate is fuller and more flavorful than your average cava, with candied apple, papaya, lime and lemon flavors. Dry, pithy and hinting at complexity on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A different breed of blended wine, with earthy aromas of dried cheese, leather, dill and vanilla. The palate is tight and mildly tannic, with sweet cola, roasted berry and earthy tobacco flavors. Not your normal bulky, dark wine; it's complex and based on 85% Garnacha and Carignan.",Spain,Red Blend
"Oddly, this is preferable to El Nido's $140 Cab-heavy fruit bomb. Maybe that's because Monastrell is the go-to grape in Jumilla, and this is 70% Monastrell and only 30% Cab compared to the opposite with El Nido. All that said, this wine is ripe, approachable and dark, with excellent balance and a fudgy, warm finish of fruitcake and blackberry. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"Starts with the scent of beef on the grill, and then folds in black fruit and fine aged cheese. The palate is as rich and smooth as a silk throw, while flavors of berry, cassis, herbs and coffee cover the bases. Mildly balsamic on the finish, yet not complicated, demanding or overly complex. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A touch scratchy and rough on the nose, with pepper and leathery fruit aromas. The palate keeps that edge while offering peppery berry flavors and oak. More tannic and woody than one might hope for, with lactic notes on the finish. Shows flashes but comes up average. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Garnacha
"Silly name but pretty good wine. A tidal wave of cherry/berry aromas is authentic, natural, youthful and floral. The palate is just as bright and bouncy, with red fruit running away with things. A touch of mineral and chocolate at the end gives it some darkness to match the vibrancy.",Spain,Monastrell
"Even though it's a sweet-styled Cava, the nose kicks up lemon and apple aromas that are familiar as can be. The palate, however, is quite sweet and supports the Semi Dry labeling. Candied but not sticky, with a slightly chalky finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Ultra purple and sort of gummy and confected. But it's also pretty solid in the mouth, with tannin instead of flatness holding things together. Tastes like sweet dark plums and candy, while a hint of black coffee darkness enters on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The Borsao brand is a bargain pioneer, and while the wines aren't $4.99 anymore they are still squarely “value” oriented. This rosé is fairly steely and fresh, with pithy grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Lean and peppery on the finish, and ready to be consumed right away.",Spain,Rosé
"Already in the twilight of its lifespan, this is a friendly rosé with a little wiggle and kick. The palate sits on ripe nectarine and pink grapefruit, while the finish offers pepper and spice. A little pithy but pretty good if you get at it soon.",Spain,Rosé
"Torres' Celeste debuted in 2003, and the '05 is the best vintage to date. The wine has penetrating berry and spice aromas and an accent of animal leather. The palate is healthy and polished, with plum, blackberry and herbal notes. Comes together well and should be good in the cellar through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts out rustic and leathery, with hints of smoke, leafiness and earth along with baked berry and spice. This four-grape wine has good density and mouthfeel that frames leather, earth and slightly baked berry fruit flavors. Finishes chocolaty and sweet, with just enough acidity to maintain balance.",Spain,Red Blend
"A delicious wine and very much the model for value in Spanish Garnacha. That this has 25% Tempranillo only seems to make it better; the nose is sweet but full and plummy. The palate is pure, flavorful and sweet, with baked cherry, earthiness and a hint of chocolate. A wine to buy in quantity, i.e. by the case.",Spain,Red Blend
"Sappy green apple, grapefruit and citrus aromas are welcoming and pure, while the palate is soft-edged, citrusy and full or tangerine and melon flavors. A good, honest, clean Verdejo that has sure-fire mass appeal. More solid than special, which is what you should want from this kind of wine.",Spain,Verdejo
"Nutty and toasty, with toffee and butter pecan aromas. The palate is wet, light, alert and snappy, but also angular and citrusy. The acidity here is key; it pushes dried apricot and tangy flavors toward a nutty finish, and overall the wine delivers what a good, higher-end palo cortado should.",Spain,Palomino
"Fragrant, clean and tropical, with slate-driven minerality. The palate is just fleshy enough but mostly it's tight and crisp, with flavors of green apple, fresh green herbs and a drip of honey. Holds it together from front to back; just right for salads and seafood-based tapas.",Spain,Godello
"Another stellar El Puntido, this time with excellent concentration and full-load aromas of black fruit, leather, fine dried cheese and cola. The palate is tight, properly stretched and racy, with bursting black raspberry and cassis flavors. Coconut and resin on the finish is the first and only glaring announcement of oak. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Just right on the nose, with a smoky, attractive set of deep berry aromas. The palate is pure and composed, with a pure, tasty mix of berry fruit, cocoa and mild oak. Smooth, long and creamy on the finish, and delicious overall. Best wine to date from Emina. Drink now into 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Protos is a flagship Ribera del Duero property and its wines have been on the rise lately. This is ripe and spicy, with black fruit and then a twitch of prune and moss on the nose. It's racy, pure, forward and stout, with a mix of red and black fruit flavors. Warm and integrated on the finish. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit of forward oak comes across on the nose, while mocha and pretty good berry fruit keep things focused. Like most Navarran wines, this is snappy and “red” in character, with herbal tomato and plum flavors. Classic finishing notes of olive and dill close things out.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A typically reserved Navarran wine is what this is. The nose offers dry red fruit, spice and not much else. The palate is mildly citric and herbal, but there's enough cherry and leather to carry things to a medium-length   finish of dill, vanilla and spice. A nice and simple food wine.",Spain,Red Blend
"A little creamy, waxy and scattershot, but also far more exotic and different than most $8 wines. This is barrel-fermented Viura, but the oak level is light and manageable. Flavors of papaya, melon and citrus are almost tropical in scope, and the finish is pretty fresh. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",Spain,Viura
"Light, laudable aromas of wood smoke, cherry, raspberry and licorice are inviting, while the palate is firm but on the precipice of sharp. In general everything is nicely put together, and overall this reserva has nice raspberry, black cherry, pastry and chocolate notes. Hold for at least another year.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Floral fruit aromas suggest blueberry, but overall this vintage lacks the power and depth that Termes and its big brothers are known for. Airing sets up sweet, easygoing berry flavors and full tannins, but in the middle it's less whole than it has been in other years. A juicy, well-made wine that should not be judged as weak just because 2007 was a marginal vintage. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Opens with cherry aromas and brightness, then the palate fans out and fattens up with juicy plum and cherry flavors along with just a touch of medicinality. Toasty, warm and tasty, with a thoroughness not usually found in $8 wines. Garnacha at 70% with 30% Syrah.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"Very smooth with youthful, juicy, fragrant berry aromas along with a bouncy palate full of sweet cherry and cassis flavors. Clean, snappy, alert and healthy. More simple and straightforward than complex, but worth the money and then some.",Spain,Garnacha
"Yellow in color, with a waxy nose that's baked, rich, a bit stalky but also honeyed. The palate is round, hefty and thick, with full melon and peach flavors in front of a plump, woody finish. Good as you're likely to find among Spanish Chardonnay.",Spain,Chardonnay
"A really nice, dark, modern style of Rioja from a good vintage. The nose is mildly foresty early on and robustly fruity, with stand-out black cherry and blackberry aromas. The palate is full, clean and balanced, with alert flavors of berry, spice, citrus peel and chocolate. Smooth as a glass table on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells more meaty and leathery than you might expect for a basic, young Tempranillo. But enough berry fruit sneaks through to make it a solid but narrow wine driven by red plum and other standard red-fruit flavors. Finishes fresh but lean.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Black licorice, mint and a hint of raisin work the nose. However, the palate on this venerable Ribera wine is a bit jumpy and early on it seems tart and miserly; the upside is that the wine will age for 15 years. To drink now it'll need to go with food. If given plenty of airing or decanting it'll show its best.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The aromas of sarsparilla, tree bark, dried raspberry and cumin take you back to traditional Rioja winemaking. With lighter-weight fruit, herb and tomato leaf flavors, this is a solid old-school wine that will hit the right marks with tapas or roast meats. It's got some tea and tang as well, courtesy of zesty acids.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An opening of apricot and peach aromas is proper, while the palate delivers a jolt of zest and acidity to more pineapple, lime and punchy green-apple flavors. Tangy later on, with more than a drop of lemon and lime to the finish. Also slightly pithy and bitter, which is natural for Godello.",Spain,Godello
"Minerality and crispness define the bouquet, which brings green apple and citrus aromas. There's punch and spritz on the palate as well as sweet citrus and juicy lime flavors that break up a little as they fan out. Not sure if there's residual sugar, but the wine tastes a bit sweet.",Spain,Albariño
"Shy at first, with standard raspberry aromas, earth and buttery notes along with cherry and raspberry flavors. Becomes fuller and more satisfying with time, and once it's fully open you have a solid, satisfying Rioja with true flavors and good overall balance.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Full, heavy, chunky wine with a powerful bouquet of black fruit and chocolate. The palate is about as full and concentrated as they come, but there's good balance and aging potential along with cassis, blackberry and mild herbal shadings. Savory and strong as it is long on the finish. Drinkable now but better from 2011–2014.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fresh-cut oak is front and center on this now-aging blend of Monastrell and Merlot. There's a green, almost cheesy accent to the nose, which is followed by generic plum flavor. Always resiny and creamy due to the oak, with some prune to the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mildly raw and reduced, but at $6 expectations shouldn't be too high. In the mouth, it's tangy and light, with zingy strawberry/raspberry flavors that have some scour. Bland but lively.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raw and rough more than flush or lush. The nose deals mildly pickled red-fruit aromas in front of a tight, acidic palate that tastes of pie cherries. Firm and zesty but not much length or substance. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fizzy and foamy and aggressive. To give it a frame of reference, it is similar to Brachetto or Frascati from Italy, but it's clumsy on the palate and tastes too much like red licorice and candied fruit to be taken too seriously. Also a bit cloying on the finish. Imported by National Distributing Co., Inc.",Spain,Rosé
"For a large-production Rioja, this sings the proper notes and shiould please almost anyone with a taste for Spanish red wines. It's violet in color, indicating good ripeness. The nose is concentrated and likable, with solid berry and plum fruit to back it up. Round, pleasant and with a touch of oaky vanilla on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with a load of sweet, candied black-fruit aromas but this wine excels on the nose because it's composed and precise for being so young and simple in scope. Velvety, rich black-cherry flavors run the show, and the finish brings length and an herbal shading. Very nice for a wine from Toro at this price.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Comes out of the chute with some aggression, but that's settled by quality apple and grassy aromas. The palate is jumpy and lively, with pleasant, slightly sweet apple and peach flavors. Shows good refinement, ample layering of flavors and a spot of minerality. As a whole, this is good cava.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice. And the flavors are friendly and suggest black fruits and smoke. A little more oaky and charred than some, but a nice crianza nonetheless.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty lemon and cidery aromas are solid and draw you in. The palate has a fresh, clean feel and lively, tangy flavors of citrus, green fruits and green herbs. Zesty, a bit lemony, and nice on the finish. Not a complicated bubbly by any means.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dark and fully oaked Rioja with vanilla, mocha, char and black-fruit aromas. The body is good while the acidity is a bit high, and thus the flavors lean toward tart black cherry and zesty wild blackberry all with a robust amount of toast, spice and charred darkness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Warm, earthy aromas of molasses, moss and baked fruit scream rich and big, and the palate matches that early announcement with cola, baked blackberry, coffee and syrupy flavors. Weighty and forceful, but not without style and a flash of elegance. Pure Toro; drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A serious, oak-influenced Godello with smooth aromas of baked apple, wood resin, vanilla, spice and green melon. The palate has weight and fine acidity, so it's tight despite delivering a blast of oaky flavor. Alongside that resiny taste, there's green banana and peach notes. Fresh but woody; should age well for at least another 18 months.",Spain,Godello
"A round, chewy wine with a nice mix of black fruit, vanilla, aged cheese and light balsam wood on the nose. The palate is big but doesn't bite back, and the flavors of creamy berry are broad and nice. A very solid wine with weight and heat; drink now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Garnacha-Cabernet Sauvignon is the blend and it's showing some age. The nose is a little heavy and murky, and so is the palate. Flavors of melon and papaya are more plump than zesty and driven. Falls rather flat on the finish. Wait for the 2008.",Spain,Rosé
"All over the map. The nose offers toast offset by gym sweat, while the palate is both tangy yet pickled, with zingy orange flavors. The wine flows across the tongue but leaves a bit of citrus rind and vinegar. Not bad per se, but has some weak links. Imported by Winelink Imports.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Big in color, with meaty, rubbery aromas that seem reduced and gaseous. The palate is black and toasty, but sort of rubbery. Burnt toast, black coffee and some bitterness control the finish. More colorful and big than flavorful and complete.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A bit too rubbery and gassy to qualify as “clean,” with leafiness running the bouquet. The palate is sort of flat, with raisin, baked cherry and prune flavors. It's on the borderline of being stewed.",Spain,Red Blend
"Not super fruity. Instead it's a generic, racy specimen with lots of zap, kick and zest but not much style, warmth or fruit. Shows fiery flavors and a tight, driving finish. Expect many 2007s, including this one, to be on the miserly side.",Spain,Tempranillo
"As a young wine, this is bold, dark, crusty and slightly out of joint. There are salty, balsamic flavors along with muscular berry notes, and then butter and other barrel-driven flavors on the finish. It's chunky bordering on huge, with balance and integration issues. Maybe a little better in six months.",Spain,Red Blend
"Gummy, pasty and sweet, with no real elegance or finesse. It's simply a dark, candied wine that's pure tutti-frutti. And the feel is more narrow than one might hope for given the wine's immense color and body.",Spain,Grenache
"Toasty and rubbery aromas lead to a drastic, rather sharp palate of brazen red cherry and plum. More tang and pickled than rich and rewarding, with a fiery mouthfeel and scouring acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Here's a wine that manages to blend classic notes of dryness, fine acidity and red fruit with modern weight, ripeness, oak and color. It's not otherwordly but it does pass all the tests. The fruit is fine but regular, while the finish hints at licorice and chocolate. A no-frills winner without a lot of fanfare.",Spain,Tempranillo
"During the harvest last fall winemaker and owner Vicki Pariente said 2007 would be a lean year in Rueda with some great wines. Hers is very pungent and full of nettles, sweat and other cool-climate symptoms. Which doesn't make it a bad wine; just tight, lean and green. If you have liked Dos Victorias Verdejo in the past, stick with it in '07.",Spain,Verdejo
"Brickish in color, with mature aromas of cedar, pine, tobacco, olive and dried fruits. There's still some racy acidity that's keeping the rooty flavors of tobacco, dried berry, coffee and spice moving forward. Finishes dry and a little bit classic; drink now for an affordable taste of Navarra.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins. There's nothing not to like about this Albariño, which is pure, pithy on the finish, and more than solid in a pedestrian, familiar sort of way.",Spain,Albariño
"Smooth on the nose, with a pinch of rubber, earth, smoked beef and plum/prune. The palate offers structure, solid acidity, zestiness and bright flavors of cherry and raspberry. Finishes crisp and tight, with lingering vanilla. A nice wine for tapas and other meat-based dishes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"While I prefer the 2009 for its clarity and freshness, this '08 is no slouching tiger. The nose delivers still-fresh apple and mineral aromas, while the flavor profile leans toward gooseberry, lemon and green melon. Shows some pithy bitterness on the finish, so drink right away or seek out the '09.",Spain,Godello
"Mineral, lime and crisp apple aromas give it a precise, pure nose. And that same character exists on the palate and finish, where white peach, green banana and melon flavors are full and forward. Shows good concentration and quality for a large-production bubbly at this price.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Jammy and sweet smelling, with intensity and a lot of ripeness. Throughout it teeters on the precipice of being overripe, but amid the chunky darkness and sweetness there's tasty berry, chocolate and spice. Finishes a bit pruney and raisiny, so get at it as soon as you can.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"An interesting, well-made wine with distinct barrel notes. There's woodspice, toast, vanilla and elegant white fruit on the nose, yet the palate maintains Verdejo's natural verve while offering flavors of cinnamon apple, spiced pear, banana and tropical fruit. Drier on the finish, with a nip of butterscotch.",Spain,Verdejo
"Full, earthy and ripe, but also delivering alot of clean fruit, size and balance. The palate has moderate to full tannic grip, which props up berry, vanilla, wood and mild herbal flavors. Long, solid and a little oaky late, with proper purity and a commitment to the near future. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An attractive, ripe wine that pushes up against raisiny but then draws back to focus on blackberry, licorice and other dark aromas and flavors. Very good weight and mouthfeel, with nice balance supporting ripe berry, cola and mild chocolate flavors. Finishes lush and warm. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A different breed of cat. The nose is akin to nail polish and sweet perfume, while the palate is super simple and doesn't rise much above liquid candy. Not awful but not challenging or refined. Has a lasting simple jamminess that isn't elevating.",Spain,Garnacha
"Violet in color but sassy. The nose is pickled and brambly, while the palate offers crusty berry fruit and herbal, marinated flavors. Edgy and sharp as feel goes, with an angular, acid-driven finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Tobacco, spice and cranberry aromas mix with nutty leather and sweat. This is a tangy, choppy wine with more tomato and citrus flavor than ripe berry fruit. So even for fans of classic Rioja this will seem light, lean and leathery.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A little jammy up front, but mostly this is dull and bland, with generic citrus-inspired flavors and some bitterness late. Can't see this really helping out food or standing alone as an apéritif.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mami Mia, this is heavy stuff. The nose on this Garnacha-Graciano mix is muddled and rubbery, while the palate is saturated but murky. Finishes almost salty, with a hint of the veggies. A loud wine that doesn't really say anything.",Spain,Garnacha-Graciano
"No Time is the name but unfortunately there's no substance and no richness. As a whole, this Garnacha smells of bramble and pickle, while the palate is fresh and bouncy but sour.",Spain,Garnacha
"Despite basic strawberry and red licorice aromas, this wine is decidedly tart. It hits with snappy nectarine flavors and then turns citric and finishes up sour. Doesn't offer much rosé pleasure; makes you wonder what's the point.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flat and loamy on the nose, and then slightly floral. There is not much going on here; the palate offers distant strawberry flavors accented by pickle, and the finish is thin, tangy and hints at tomato. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This wine doesn't do much for Navarra's reputation as prime Spanish rosé country. It's a little burnt and acrid, with weak and muddled raspberry and pickle flavors. Finishes dry as a soda cracker.",Spain,Rosé
"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance. Powerful acidity pushes it in the right direction, and the finish of lychee, passion fruit and nectarine is lasting. Very nice wine but relatively high in price.",Spain,Albariño
"Stylistically, this is at odds with what I feel Albariño should be. That said, it's a well-executed and well-made barrel-fermented white with full-force toast and popcorn aromas followed by a resiny, vanilla-fueled flavor profile that folds in apple, banana and creamy frosting. Still vital and healthy after three years in bottle.",Spain,Albariño
"For Navarran Merlot-Cab, Inurrieta Norte is always a winner. This vintage has good darkness along with smooth aromas of black fruit, earth, rubber and spice. It's a bit acidic and shrill as a tasting wine but will do fine at the table. The mouth is spunky and shows slightly herbal raspberry and plum flavors. Finishes light and easy.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"For a rosado cava, this offers nice fruit, balance and complexity. The nose is pure cherry and raspberry, but in subdued doses. Meanwhile, it's zesty, foamy and fresh in the mouth, with nectarine, plum, strawberry and prickle. Perfectly nice for everyday quaffing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"For a Valencia D.O. wine, this is darn appealing. The nose is warm, rooty and smells of cola nut, fresh raisins and cassis, while the driving palate offers roasted black fruit flavors along with sweet tomato and herbs. Drying and tannic on the finish, but balanced. Neither cooked nor overweight. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pine needle, cedar plank and forest floor define the mature nose, while the full, grabby, tannic palate is loaded with likable cola, black fruit and chocolate flavors. Ripe, pure, rich and tannic, with some bite, burn and ruggedness. Drinkable now but needs food to cut the tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's no denying the wine's power and intensity. It's concentrated like a cement block, with richness, plummy aromas, sweetness and char. But it's also candied and ultrarich in the mouth, with syrupy flavors of berry extract, cola and chocolate. A heavy wine that shows every ounce of its 15.5% alcohol. Ultimately it's more sweet and powerful than it is precise. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"This wine gets it right. The color is dark and opaque, while the nose offers perfume, Middle Eastern spice, fruitcake and solid black fruit. Enticing in the mouth, where full black fruit flavors are pumped up by fine herb and spice notes. And then coffee and chocolate fill the finish. Drink now through 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A dud given that this is the winery's top effort. It's green and vegetal, with ashtray aromas. More like salad than wine. Not too many wines these days are blatantly bell peppery, but this is.",Spain,Red Blend
"Cáceres does basic Viura as well as anyone in Spain. Every year this wine shows a confident blend of citrus and mineral, with aromas of citrus fruits and pineapple and flavors of green apple and lime. It's juicy, fresh and amounts to the quintessential summer sipper.",Spain,Viura
"For inexpensive Albariño, Nessa delivers the goods. The nose is flowery and soft, but most of all it's inviting. The palate is easy and light in the middle, and along the edges apricot and citrus flavors are pleasant. Finishes round, with apple and melon notes. Drink right away.",Spain,Albariño
"Cotton candy and warm, dusty aromas give the wine pleasant, semisweet opening aromas. The palate is round and solidly formed, with creamsicle flavors and a bit of brown sugar or treacle. A good wine with just a touch of sweetness in the middle; must be a touch of residual sugar here.",Spain,Rosé
"Aromas of cherry and leather come with burnt earth and smoke, but overall the nose is inviting. The palate is solid in feel, with good weight and drive that supports a smoky flavor profile of red berries and controlled bitterness. Finishes toasty, with a lick of bitter chocolate.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A perfectly solid Garnacha with pepper, bright red fruit and a touch of country style to the bouquet despite its pedestrian price. The palate is bright and tastes of plum and red berry, while the feel is good and the finish fruity and lively. What inexpensive red wine should be.",Spain,Garnacha
"Opens with sly, clean mineral and white fruit aromas that hook you into its lively but round palate of citrus, green melon and fresh herbs. There's plenty of fruit and acidity to keep it moving, and overall it's a Verdejo done right.",Spain,Verdejo
"Ripe, stout and concentrated on the bouquet, with cassis and lightly roasted berry aromas. Solid and tannic in the mouth, with full plum and cherry flavors. Finishes big and friendly, with a very mild herbal undertone and a slight dose of sauciness. Very nice RDD.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This wine is clearly shooting for the modern style of Rioja; it's dark as night, soft and meaty. But it also has a lot of gaseous sulfur on the nose and hard tannins. Expect a chewy, broad Rioja that's hedonistic but on the cusp of overripe. Decant before drinking within the next two years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A little rough around the edges, i.e. there's a sharp note to the nose and then lots of barrel char to back that up. There's black fruit, pepper and lots of oak on the palate, which has a full feel and then firm, clamping tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Watermelon, cantaloupe and peach aromas are just as they should be, while the palate is whole, fresh and full of tangerine and nectarine. Compact, defined and complete, with a smooth, light finish. Nothing miraculous but great for summer sipping.",Spain,Rosé
"Coconut and wintergreen aromas announce new oak, and as it opens this somewhat muscular Rioja unveils butter and charred scents. It's full, with good acid-to-tannin balance, and the fruit is forward and ripe. A little bit sweet and chunky in the final analysis, but a nice modern-influenced Rioja on the whole. Drink now through 2009.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Clear and focused, with raspberry and edgy spice aromas to the nose. The palate doesn't bring a whole bunch of meat or heft, but it is clean, racy and food-friendly. Flavors of red berries and pepper are normal and expected, while the finish is dry and lean.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lime, citrus and other pungent aromas get it off to a good start, while the palate is wet and fresh, with clean, familiar grapefruit, lime and nectarine flavors. Lighter and less concentrated than Naia, but still a very good Verdejo for the price.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dry and subtle on the nose, with cherry and plum fruit scents mixed with balsam wood. The palate is tight, simple and offers a bit of creaminess to go with raspberry and oak-based vanilla and mocha. Light on the finish and fresh, with a medium body.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Timid but clean as a whistle on the nose, with apple and vanilla aromas along with a sprinkling of talcum powder. The palate is lively and fresh, with flavors of pineapple, lemon and other tropical hints. Entirely pedestrian as cava goes, but 100% clean and refreshing.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dry and peppery to start, with muted berry fruit aromas along with wood shavings. The palate is snappy, clean and juicy, with raspberry, vanilla and tobacco-like flavors. More basic than special, with a steady, light-framed finish. More than functional; likely good with food.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with floral, blueberry aromas, mineral notes and a spot of jammy candy. The palate is alert and well balanced, with grab and juicy flavors of raspberry and plum offset by a wave of buttery oak. Textured, full and satisfying on the finish. Very nice wine.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"A solid, serious Rioja reserva with licorice, leather, char and good berry aromas. The palate is juicy, pure and tastes of clean black cherry and cola flavors. Picks up steam as it opens up, and then finishes with a light butter streak and proper weight. No complaints; almost makes the upper echelon. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Classic Verdejo that won't wow but will definitely get your palate going. Standard but clean grapefruit and gooseberry aromas lead to citric but balanced flavors of orange, grapefruit and pineapple. On the dot in terms of balance. Drink as soon as possible.",Spain,Verdejo
"This vintage rosado is as good as always, but a bit lower on the quality ladder than previous years. The color is light pink and soft on the eye, while the nose suggests brick dust and orange peel. Smooth and easygoing, with sweet, generic flavors of orange and berry.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Normally this producer's high-end Sherries are outstanding, but this Amontillado is aggressive and hard, with a clod-like character that starts with molasses on the nose and then turns toward sharpness and bitterness on the palate. Try as I might, this one strikes me as good but loud, hard, forceful and lacking the suavity that great Sherries possess.",Spain,Sherry
"This is your quintessential simple quaff among brut cavas. It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors. It's slightly sweet and tropical, but still it holds onto its crisp qualities and dryness. No complaints for the money.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Slightly low on kick and bubbles for a blanc de blancs, but the wine's mix of green herb, apple, green banana and melon flavors is good and offers the proper set up to a finish that's citrusy as can be and only slightly pithy. Seems a touch flat or it might have rated even higher.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dusty, slightly candied aromas are briary and pretty good, and overall it's giving freshness, pop and red-fruit flavors touched up by dill, nutmeg and vanilla. Clean and lively on the finish, and more than competent as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts out with roasted, stewy, beefy aromas and not much brightness. The palate is measured and healthy, with dry raspberry, currant and medicinal plum flavors. It shows oak, earth, leather, acidity and some burn. In a nutshell, it's a good, standard, respectable Rioja that will complement almost any food.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A heavy, slightly strained wine that has a lot in tow. The nose is smoky, rubbery like an inner tube, and a bit herbal. In the mouth, it's a wide load with sweet, sugary, baked flavors of blackberry, prune, fig and chocolate. Very much on the ripe side, with a full tannic bite.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Initially it's rugged, but airing reveals black-cherry aromas and dry spice. The palate is crisp and a little sheer by itself, but the call here is that with food it'll be a winner. Flavors of red fruits are dry and collected, while the finish blends in coffee, spice and a touch of herbal Navarran panache.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Good on the nose, with solid raspberry and nectarine aromas. The palate is spunky and alert, with juicy red-cherry, rhubarb and integrated spice flavors. It's mostly a clean, basic, easy-to-drink bubbly, but it's persistent, harmonious and commendable. Pinot Noir with Trepat is the grape mix.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Aromas of apple cider and mild spice get it going in a good direction, and this colorfully packaged cava does pretty well in the mouth, where the texture is on the soft side and the flavors of apple and orange run a bit sweet. Not complex but good, fluffy and yeasty.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Definitely a once-ripe, raisiny wine with hard Toro tannins and molasses aromas and flavors. Borderline syrupy but with enough structure and grip to make the grade. Warming and rich wine, with a fierce strucutre and big tannic framework. Drink now.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Bold and chunky Ribera wine with black fruit aromas that don't tread lightly. The palate is lush and features a nice overall feel, while the flavors of berry fruit and chocolate hint at raisin but don't fully cross the threshhold. Heavier and darker than prior years. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's an exotic twist to the nose, which rests on black cherry, plum and a splash of black coffee. The palate is sound and structured, with dark fruit flavors accented by spice and tea notes. Comfortable on the finish, with good tannins and acids holding it all together. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Full, ripe and so tannic in its present form that it's scratchy and hard on the mouth. Aromas of ripe berry and syrup hint at its core power, while flavors of blackberry, fresh raisin and chocolate are true and good. A powerpacked wine with a fierce mouthfeel; only time can bring it around. Hold until 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Peachy, mildly sweet, smooth and inviting. Godeval always makes a true and easy wine that showcases the essence of Godello but doesn't go off the blueprint. Flavors of apple and citrus are well blended, and the grapefruity finish is only mildly pithy. Eminently drinkable white wine from Spain.",Spain,Godello
"A touch raisiny and sweet from nose to tail, but what's in between is convincing for Jumilla. Aromas of licorice and herbs are sweet but nice, while the flavors or raisin and blackberry are chunky, with a basic finish that's a little flat but definitely ripe. A blend of Monastrell, Cabernet, Tempranillo and Merlot that's ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"For Spanish Chardonnay, this is perfectly good and clean. The nose brings your basic set of white-fruit, mineral and fresh herb flavors, while the palate is lively despite some dry, resiny oak flavor. Even with banana, vanilla and creamy flavors, the wine is decidedly not cloying.",Spain,Chardonnay
"This winery is known for red Mencía, but this small-lot Godello is perfectly nice and drinkable. It has a neutral nose and a fresh palate of green melon, nectarine and apple flavors. The finish is clipped and a touch bitter, but there's no denying its tangy, forward approach. Only 250 cases made.",Spain,Godello
"Dusty earth and dry spice aromas blend with some char, vanilla and berry/cherry on the nose. The palate shows average density and depth, with lighter flavors of strawberry, raspberry, herbs, tobacco and vanilla. Finishes dry and peppery, with some toast.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A blend of Tempranillo with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot. Aromas of black cherry, spice, aged cheese and earth are solid, while the palate features good fruit but some weakness in structure. Flavors of black cherry and berry are rich at first but fade fast, while the finish is nice but short on complexity. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A round, full specimen with mineral-laden raspberry aromas and a fresh but serious palate of berry, cherry cough drop and fine rubber. There's a distinct creamy, oaky feel that's confirmed by finishing flavors of vanilla, mocha and woodspice. A step up the ladder for Campo de Borja.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"Coconut and vanilla aromas are squarely in the lead, but the nose's berry base is more than solid. Plump, round and showing good overall balance, with flavors of cola, dark fruit and coconut. A ripe, bulky crianza with plenty of leftover oak on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little heavy and sweet on the nose, but juicy and deep on the palate, with round, pleasant lemon, grapefruit and green melon flavors. Dry, pure and driving white wine with a long, clean finish. Galician Godello in good form.",Spain,Godello
"There's no shortage of ripe aromas: leather, berries and aged cheese. Yet the palate is quite sharp, with searing acidity sitting on top of red-berry flavors. This wine has unlimited aging potential, but will it ever taste great? That remains to be seen.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha fruit that leaves a red tint and sweet aromas. The palate has plenty of jump and bounce in its step, while the flavors are both sweet and sour. A little sheer but a good wine with ample character.",Spain,Rosé
"Leafy and peppery on the nose, with light red-fruit aromas and some citrus peel. It runs more lean and spicy than anything, with hints of tomato leaf, fennel and sausage.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"El Coto has gotten its game in gear in recent years. The brand's value-priced wines like this Viura are clean and proper. In this case, opening aromas of stone and lime yield to green fruits and cucumber. The wine is easy and fresh, with a juicy, simple mouthfeel.",Spain,Viura
"Clean and minerally, with stony aromas along with banana and pineapple. The palate is tight, clean and balanced, with flavors of green banana, papaya and apple. Finishes pithy and with a touch of fresh-grated white pepper. A good but common type of unoaked Chardonnay.",Spain,Chardonnay
"A clean, fresh, appealing sort of Tempranillo with cola, earth, black cherry and berry aromas followed by a bright, forward, spicy cherry palate. Honest, snappy, healthy and juicy; nice and solid for La Mancha.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Simple, nice and not trying too hard; this basic brut is graced with nice apple and citrus aromas. The palate is wet, juicy and classic, with crisp apple, green herb and melon flavors. Round, clean and just crisp enough.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish. For under $15 this is good, casual Albariño that won't steer you wrong.",Spain,Albariño
"A heavier style of Rioja, with raisin and prune aromas and a brandied character. The palate is expectedly flush and ripe, with weight and size along with black cherry and herbal tea flavors. Shows good stamina and fullness on the finish. Ready to drink now before it starts to fade.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Heavier and oakier than No. 12, and in our opinion not quite as balanced. The nose is rich, minty and raisiny, while the rock-solid palate has fierce tannic grip and flavors of black cherry, tomato and cola. Firm and composed on the finish, but a pounding heavyweight. Drink now thru 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Crisp on the bouquet, with green apple and controlled fresh celery aromas. The palate is also fresh, with basic roundness, bounce and natural flavors of apple cider, citrus and lime. Finishes with a slice of white grapefruit and a tiny spot of pith. Drink immediately.",Spain,Verdejo
"Aromas of sawdust announce oak, but otherwise the nose is earthy and fairly attractive, with plum and rooty notes. Round, ripe, tannic and solid in the mouth, with broad flavors of black cherry, rubber and oak. Shows good grip on a slightly oaky, medicinal finish. Hold another nine months to let the oak settle.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo
"Immediately this strikes you as true Verdejo from Rueda. It has pungency on the nose, with accents of cucumber and celery to the primary passion fruit, apricot and citrus aromas. Plenty of zing to it, and tastes of citrus and fresh green apples. Then tangerine and grapefruit carry the finish. Varietally correct.",Spain,Verdejo
"Quite rustic smelling, with hickory smoke, barbecue sauce, spice and cola aromas. Like most Cigales wines, it has a firm tannic bite and a grating mouthfeel. But the flavors of roast berry, black plum and savory marinade is good and par for the course. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Incognito deftly describes the unusual beet and blueberry aromas on this wine, which is a bit narrow and scracthy. On the plus side, it's concentrated and powerful, with bold berry flavors, tannic grip and herbal influences. Chunky on the finish but lacks the precision and identifiable Ribera del Duero character that a $75 wine should have.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not an expressive Rueda but it sizzles. Despite being young and driving, it's more neutral in flavor and texture than the winery's Verdejo, which is excellent. This wine shows all citrus with light green accents, and with shrimp or Asian foods it'll do well.",Spain,White Blend
"This semisweet blend of Malvasia and Viura is not everyday stuff, but if you have a taste for something sweet and different, give it a try. The nose is floral and waxy, while flavors of honey and ultraripe pineapple are heady and sugary. Not a drop-dead winner but unique and interesting.",Spain,White Blend
"Almond, sherry and banana aromas start it out. The palate is mellow and smooth, with apple and touches of lemon. There's ring and some zing on the finish, but not too much as the wine is beginning to show signs of reaching early maturity. Drink immediately.",Spain,Albariño
"Tan in color, with short flashes of apple and spice on the bouquet. The palate has a small level of oxidation, while the mouthfeel benefits from smooth but present acidity. Limited in scope and flavor, but solid for a wine that's beginning to fade.",Spain,Albariño
"Fresh and full of lime on the nose, and overall this is simple, smooth and gives you little reason to worry or fuss. The palate is smooth, creamy and a little low on acids, thus the lemon-lime and melon flavors have a fullness that's sweet and good.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Sweet and a little grassy on the nose, with lemon-lime aromas. The palate has a solid, regular, friendly feel along with sweet flavors of white nectarine, apple juice and tarragon. Perfectly quaffable, dry in feel despite being semisweet, and balanced. For the price, what's not to like? Imported",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Maturing fairly well, with brown edges to the wine's earthy hue. The nose is rooty and deep, but there's a definite cheesy, mildly bretty accent to it. And the mouthfeel is defined by major tannic grip and bite. Warm and mildly raisiny, with caramel on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Slightly prickly on the nose, but there's balancing melony sweetness to keep it on line. The palate is fresh and snappy, with citrus flavors, particularly grapefruit. And the finish is lemony and dry. No glaring faults; good Verdejo to drink ASAP.",Spain,Verdejo
"Firm, earthy and rubbery aromas lead to a tight, focused palate with robust black cherry in the lead and black tea and coffee notes along the side. Toasty, dark and a touch bitter on the finish, and overall it's a solid crianza with condensed flavors and a basic mouthfeel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sassy pepper and light rhubarb aromas give this medium-weight crianza a spicy, lean outlook. The palate has tang, vibrant red fruit and mildly grating acidity, while the finish runs zesty and rings about your mouth as it does a spicy fade. A wine for current consumption.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light berry and sugar cookie aromas kick it off, followed by peach pit and nectarine flavors. For a wine that's basic in composition and a little dilute, it's also fresh and held together by good acidity. Straightforward but solid.",Spain,Rosé
"Clean, fresh and simple. Gran Feudo will neither thrill nor disappoint as it delivers adequate citrus, raspberry and rhubarb flavors propelled by choppy, stinging acids. It shows a good attack before breaking up on the finish. A can't-fail rosé for the summer and fall of 2008.",Spain,Rosé
"A neutral cava with white candy and mango on the nose. The palate is both foamy and scouring, with soda cracker, apple and citrus pith creating the flavor profile and finish. Shows basic flavors, normal mouthfeel and scouring acidity.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Opens somewhat clipped and choppy, with citrusy aromas mixed with red fruits. The palate is healthy, lean and acidic, with bright plum and berry flavors softened by some creamy vanilla. A solid wine with punch, acidity and a good finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Lucid and basically colorless, with flowery, lychee-like aromas that suggest Malvasia or Moscatel. But it's only Viura and Chardonnay, and it tastes fresh, floral and nice, with lime and lychee. About as easy as they come.",Spain,White Blend
"A bit unusual and confusing, but that's because it hails from the Rioja region. The nose is herbal and mustardy, with green aromas leading to a cidery palate of apples and spice. There's also a bit of lemon and creaminess to this cava. Hard to understand but not without its merits.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dark, roasted lead aromas frame secondary baked black fruit and leather scents, while the palate is oaky, stocky and tannic, with creamy, barrel-led berry flavors and more than adequate balance and freshness. Mocha and toast are key finishing notes, and overall it's a nice blend of 85% Garnacha with Syrah.",Spain,Grenache-Syrah
"One of Spain's top value-oriented rosés. It's inviting, colorful, easy to understand and tasty. Aromas of fresh fruits and melon get it going, while the palate is clean, fresh, only mildly candied and full of cherry and red plum flavors. Scores high by keeping it simple. Drink ASAP.",Spain,Rosé
"A clean, almost oceanic opening is fresh and citrusy as it should be, while the palate shows pulse, balance and a little scour to go with orange, grapefruit and other citrusy flavors. Pithy and biting late, with ample fruit throughout.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"A forward specimen with lots of oak that settles on cinnamon and wood tannin. Also a touch leafy on the nose, and that's backed by tangy cranberry and acid-driven cherry flavors. Very tight and piercing, which for a 2005 crianza is asking too much.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A crisp, clean, no-frills white wine that pushes citrus more than heft. Mineral and lime aromas set up zesty citrus flavors, and overall it's a scouring but steady rendition that'll do best when served well chilled.",Spain,Viura
"The quality of the 2009 vintage is reflected in this value-priced Toro that's full and medicinal but also balanced and rewarding. Flavors of medicinal red-berry fruit are mixed with thicker, chocolaty notes, while the finish is bold, grabby and solid. A blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Clean and approachable, with lemon-lime aromas leading to an easy, mildly crisp palate with lemon, lime and honeydew flavors. Sweet in accordance with standard extra dry guidelines, and also good for apéritifs and sparkling cocktails.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Apple, spearmint, mixed greens and citrus carry the bouquet to a firm palate with dry papaya, lemon and herb flavors. Finishes with apple, lemon and bitterness. Very basic and quaffable, but nothing extraordinary.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Slightly saucy on the nose, with jammy, baked fruit aromas hinting at cherry and raspberry. The palate feel is a little tough but healthy, with red fruit flavors accented by vanilla and coconut. Tight, crisp and showing a final wave of tomato on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of Christmas spice, pepper and dried fruit fall more into the traditional category than modern, while the palate is snappy, a little lean and delivers strawberry and raspberry fruit with a light buttery oak note. Tight and dry on the finish, but lean. Ready to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Neutral aromas of citrus and almond skin precede a jumpy, fresh and spritzy palate of green apple and citrus flavors. Tight, crisp, food-friendly white wine with cut and zest. Comfortably fits the Rueda/Verdejo model.",Spain,Verdejo
"Much more fresh and perky than previous years, with grapefruit, nectarine and other citrusy aromas. Pink grapefruit is without doubt the lead player in terms of flavor, and otherwise it's simply a tight, citric wine with scour and poise. Drink now.",Spain,Godello
"A great Priorat, plain and simple. And while we have always liked Les Eres from Joan Simó, this vintage is the best we've tried. The nose is beautiful: coffee, cola, schist, black fruit and herbs rise up. In the mouth, there's strength but restraint; huge black fruit, pulsing tannins and subtleties. Power and precision as well. A brilliant wine that can be drunk now with decanting, or better: hold for another 4–12 years.",Spain,Red Blend
"The aromas are sweet, while the palate is light and graced by easygoing cherry and raspberry flavors. A little bit pointed and sharp in feel, but good in a citrusy sort of way.",Spain,Garnacha
"Concentrated to the hilt, with molten black fruit, coconut and mint aromas. The palate is driven, tannic, pure and features dynamite flavors of black fruit, bitter chocolate and spice cake. So beautiful and big, but also showing elegance and restraint. Drinkable now but will age well for another seven years or more.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"What a beauty! Masculine aromas of black fruits, cola and oak sit there begging to be sipped, while the lush, deep palate is home to dense blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Lively but dense, with tannins, plenty of oak and a finish of black pepper, fudge and vanilla. Complex and exciting Spanish wine. Needs time; best from 2012 through 2018.",Spain,Red Blend
"A rich, bacony, black fruit monster with deep, molten flavors and immense body and tannic grab. A bruising wine with boysenberry, blackberry, mint, licorice and chocolate for primary flavors, and then lemony oak as a backdrop. Young, tannic and wild now; best from 2011 through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Sort of generic and oily on the nose, with white-fruit aromas that don't fully register. The palate is both spongy and spritzy, with dry, soft flavors of melon and papaya. More fluffy and lush than zesty and precise.",Spain,Verdejo
"Waxy on the nose, with buttercup, creamy yellow-fruit scents and white flowers. The palate is wet, racy and a touch like soda, with sweet, candied flavors of peach and melon. Plods along with good enough acidity to support the wine's core sweetness and candied qualities.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Starts with distinct, hard aromas of mustard, horseradish and jerky. In the mouth, it's full, bullish and tannic, with flavors of bacon, wood resin, smoke and stewed blackberry. Very smoky and dark, with hard tannins, and just not as good as past vintages.",Spain,Merlot
"Unusual in that this cava hails from the Ribera del Duero region, where red wines are 99.9% of the show. For a no-dosage nature, it's properly crisp and dry, almost like a liquid version of a soda cracker. There are some holes in the fabric but overall it's citrusy, tight and only mildly bitter on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Bold, forward and extracted red wine, with raspberry, earth, compost and a light leafiness to the nose. Tannic and tight, with plum and heavy, ripe berry flavors. Toasty and dark on the finish too, with power and freshness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of rubber, smoked beef, syrupy berry and buttery oak are inviting enough, while the palate has edgy acidity that pushes the wine's black cherry element while cutting an obvious oak dosage. Accents of tea, herbs and spice give it character; finishes with an obvious kick of butter and resin.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"A little saucy and leathery on the nose, but there's also licorice, blackberry and woody aromas to ponder. Flush and well composed on the palate, with plum, raspberry and mild salty, savory notes. Finishes with good feel but a slight herbal taste of tomato and/or oregano.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bursts with bright, linear cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors, but it's not caustic, sharp or grating. Acidity at peak power yields a zesty, racy personality while a blanket of vanilla flavor softens the cherry and raspberry fruit. Crisp and a good food wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark purple in color, with can't-miss aromas of prune and raisin. The palate is predictably soft, with manageable heft but low acidity and thus very soft edges. Flavors of baked black fruits are warm but short, and the oak is plentiful. A little too ripe and raisiny to rate higher.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice value red wine with solid black fruit aromas, licorice and crushed mineral notes. It's flush and showing good volume, and the plum/berry core flavors have a vanilla accent. Mildly medicinal on the finish but overall it offers good power, structure and concentration.",Spain,Grenache-Syrah
"We would not have expected anything to match the stellar 2004 San Román, but this newest vintage is up to the task. It's opaque as midnight without a moon, and the nose is a delectable blend of vanilla, spice, hickory, mocha and meaty blackberry. The palate is both magnetic and sly; it pumps black fruit galore, but augments things with controlled chocolate and spice. Finishes a mile long, with cream, intensity and guile. This wine does not mess around. Best from 2010–2016.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A little bit off balance, with mild compost and earth on the nose giving way to an angular palate with pointed acids along with flavors of zesty berries and red apple skins.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Heavy, dark, candied and jammy, with a hint of licorice to the nose. The palate is chunky and concentrated, with meaty berry flavors and a dose of chocolate. Short on the finish, yet fruity if a bit flat.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Grassy and pungent, with lime, citrus and white pepper on the nose. Tangy and simple across the palate, with basic pineapple and passion fruit flavors. Good but thins out on the finish, leaving leftover acidity.",Spain,Verdejo
"Lean, focused cherry and raspberry aromas properly portend a snappy, fresh, edgy palate of semitart red plum and raspberry flavors. Buttery oak brings some softness, while the finish is a bit hot and high in acid. More traditional in style than modern.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Excelencia is a great wine that offers a lot of character beyond just bold fruit and body. This is by far the best El Albar that the Lurtons have made; it features citrus peel, sexy berry fruit and baking spices on the nose, and then sweet berry, black plum, spice and warmth on the palate. It's powerful as a Toro wine should be, but not tannic or harsh. A monster with a smile; drink now and over the next 5–8 years.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
Opens with candied berry and salinic aromas. It's tough in its youth and also a little too funky to inspire much confidence for the future. Toughness in tannins; toughness in fruit; quite peppery on the finish. It just isn't that inviting.,Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Light on the nose, with nondistinct but fairly fresh fruit aromas. The palate is tangy and shows a combo of red apple and citrus flavors. Finishes with pink grapefruit pith and cleansing acids.",Spain,Rosé
"Light on the nose, with dilute red-berry aromas and mild leathery, cheesy notes. The palate is kind of raw and lean, with tangy, crisp flavors of pie cherry and raspberry. Dry, peppery, snappy wine, with definitive crispness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pale and low on bead, but if you like a Moscato-style wine, this isn't bad at all. The palate is sweet, fleshy and smooth, with lychee and melon flavors. Lively but easy on the finish, with a final wave of lychee fruit and Malvasia-driven sweetness. Unusual but pretty good.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"An improvement from recent years, but that may be a reflection of when we're tasting the wine. At this point in time it's showing dusty plum and raspberry aromas and good body weight. The flavors of raspberry and cherry are solid, while the finish is cleansing. Beyond palatable; it's really a nice rosé from Tempranillo.",Spain,Tempranillo
"For a large-production, simple red wine, this Garnacha-Syrah blend is good. The nose features red licorice candy, cherry and raisin aromas, while the palate is round, fairly smooth in feel, and tastes of bright red fruits and milk chocolate.",Spain,Garnacha-Syrah
"A little heat on the nose is acceptable given that the remaining cherry and plum aromas are pure. A bit acidic on the palate but staunchly fresh, with good fruit flavor in the red plum category. Cleansing due to higher acidity, with hints of mocha and mineral.",Spain,Grenache
"Opens with tight black cherry and raspberry aromas, but also a whiff of pine and chemical. The palate is round, full and tannic, with snappy berry flavors accented by balasmic notes, oak resin and vanilla. Finishes with traditional vanilla-dill notes and a slight stemminess.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With Matallana, you must pay for your pleasure. But pleasurable it is. The nose is a splendid blend of licorice, baking spices, cassis and black plum. The approach is neither quiet nor loud, but well-spoken. It pumps forth huge black cherry and plum fruit, but offsets any raw size with tobacco, herb, coffee and other subtleties. A touch hard now but should soften with a couple of years aging. Best from 2010–2013.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Smoky, dark and alluring is how this modern-leaning Rioja starts out. The nose is meaty and ultraripe, but balanced. And so is the palate, which shows flavors of blackberry, cassis, tobacco, cola and coffee. The finish is cuddly and long, with a splinter of coconut and lots of spice. A “racimo” in Spanish is a bunch, so the name refers to the three or so grape bunches that each vine produces.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Sometimes less is more, and with Figuero's wines the shorter the time spent in oak the more amplified the fruit. This crianza, like its sibling from 2005, is textured and totally sound. The nose is plump and intensely fruity, while the palate has a fine but racy feel and flavors of blackberry, plum, chocolate and cola. Long and layered on the finish, and pure. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"If you catch this wine young and properly chilled, it isn't that bad. It's very sweet and sugary, with candied melon, mango and citrus flavors. Then it gets more tropical on the finish, with ending notes of banana and mango. On the verge of tasting fake but not quite.",Spain,White Blend
"Hot and earthy, with herbal aromas sitting in front of a hard, grabby palate. The flavors show more plum skin and sourness than sweet, ripe juice. Hence the wine is narrow and fairly astringent. On the plus side, it seems natural and typical for what Cariñena produces.",Spain,Red Blend
"Despite a fairly positive bouquet, the mouthfeel is tight and the flavor profile is narrow. Sheer across the palate with hard cherry and mild citrus flavors. There's no shortage of tannin either on this young red.",Spain,Red Blend
"Floral, earthy, funky and barnyardy, with all the young exuberance that comes with joven/roble wines from RDD. Lots of color, power, tannins and extract along with young, sweet, chewy black-fruit flavors and tart acidity to the palate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hot earth, baked cherry and mild vanilla aromas come in front of a snappy, angular palate with tangy pie-cherry and red-plum flavors. Sheer and basic Rioja with high acidity, lean fruit, a cleansing finish and a light body.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells oily and a little burnt and acrid, with fleshy flavors of banana, melon and bitter pith. Has some verve but mostly it's an average wine with some bitterness and dry orange peel and pith. Decent but offers nothing beyond.",Spain,Verdejo
"Lively, candied and medicinal, with grassy aromas along with mild animal notes. The palate is young, grabby, forceful but solid, while the flavors are bright, bold, snappy and suggest red plum and black cherry. A basic young wine that's decent if you're not too discerning.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Warm and rich wine, with big black cherry, raspberry, vanilla and cedary aromas. Well-oaked if nothing else, with mixed red fruits, black plum and a ton of vanilla on the palate. Lovely texture and stoutly structured, and the finish is full but soft, with dry spice and even more vanilla. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Pure, soft, balanced and classy, with raisin, earth and fine leather on the nose. The palate is warm and smooth, with lasting acidity that creates juicy cherry, plum and fresh tomato flavors. On the finish, chocolate and caramel enter the picture. Complex and still vital. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Warm, baked aromas smell of clay and raisin, and later a wave of minty green enters the picture. The palate is sort of lean, with some holes in the fabric, while flavors of wild berry and black fruits fold in a heavier note of molasses. Limited in its virtues; short in complexity.",Spain,Tinta Fina
"A little dusty and spicy on the nose, with pear and apple checking in. The palate has spritz and acidity, while the flavors run sweet with ripe apple, pineapple and tropical fruit. Tastes like orange candy on the finish, with a sugary lasting impression. Good but needs more balance and harmony.",Spain,Godello
"Dark and powerfully oaked despite its 5-month pedigree. Mint, tar, shoe polish and blackberry work the bouquet, while the palate is structured and tight but also quite dark and woody. Mocha, butter and pepper flavors carry the finish on this healthy and structured wine that may also be too oaky for its own benefit.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Old wines are not easy to appreciate, so we'd almost rather have you judge this wine. In our opinion, it's way too sour and lacking in fruit to justify rave reviews. Thirty years of age doesn't seem to have helped it, and what's left is sherried and pruny, yet with sharp acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Rather minty and herbal up front, with grassy, field-like aromas overriding the red fruit that wants to peek through. The palate offers only secondary fruit flavors that turn to cider if given time. Acceptable but doesn't offer much.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Past its prime. The nose is heavy and the palate deals minimal peach flavors. It's wet but losing clarity, with bland apple and pear flavors left on the finish. This is not quite dead but best to wait for 2007.",Spain,Albariño
"A bit flat and jammy on the nose, and then it runs hot and heavy across the palate, where the flavors waver between citric and plum-cherry. There's a lot of fruit here, but also some burn and finally a dull hum to the finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Earthy but sharp on the nose, with a foreboding sense of stem and sourness. The palate is indeed raw and acidic, with lean, slightly stemmy flavors of herbs, raspberry and plum. Not bad but carries a stemmy, less-than-pure personality.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A rubbery, minty, jammy wine, with a mildly candied, gummy feel and sweet, modest, lightly green flavors that suggest red fruits. The finish is decent but herbal and sweet.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opaque and nearly over the top, with concentrated, roasted aromas of baked blackberry and dark plums. Super big and weighty, with driving flavors and some of the same lemony oak displayed by the Torre Muga 2005. Finishes in a mass of fudge, black olive and roasted berries. Hold until 2011–12, then drink.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"About as big and ripe as they come before tilting to the other side. Aromas of prune, raisin, marzipan, leather and baked berry fruit are sweet and inviting, while the loaded, tannic palate deals big berry flavors, tea and spice. Mint and coconut grace the pusling, stocked finish. Drink from 2012 thru 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Joan Simó had great success in 2005. This wine is excellent and the higher-end Les Eres is outstanding, so bottom line: buy Simó from 2005. Getting back to Sentius, a so-called “second” wine, it is dark, sexy, smooth and shows true Priorat accents of schist, coffee, cola and berry aromas. The flavors are flashy and fresh, with mammoth black cherry, plum and coffee virtually jumping from the glass. A very deep and balanced wine to drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"Melis is a project backed by wine industry folks from California, but this blend of old-vines Grenache along with Carignan, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is very European. It's heady but well balanced, with smooth edges and not too much fiery attitude, roughness or scratchy tannins. It's forward and big-boned, but there's enough creamy richness to make it friendly. Needs plenty of air time now; should hold well for five-plus years.",Spain,Red Blend
"Racy red wine, with mild bramble and brine aromas to go with spunky cherry-plum flavors. Quite zesty, bright and juicy, but solidly put together and not overly acidic. Even shows a distant chocolaty side, which is not uncommon for young Garnacha.",Spain,Garnacha
"No one says Verdejo is an ager, but this '08 is fading. The nose is soft and peachy, with weight and vanilla. The palate is equally soft and melony, and the green-fruit flavors are starting to turn mealy. Still good enough, but without much spunk it might be better to wait for 2009.",Spain,Verdejo
"How many $5 wines are this good? Not many. The nose is zesty and aggressive but settles and doesn't offend, while the juicy, fresh palate has bright cherry and raspberry flavors. Basic, ripe, clean red wine.",Spain,Syrah
"Aromas of medicinal berry, sucking candy, rhubarb and raspberry are a touch gawky, but the snappy palate of blueberry and boysenberry is good. Fresh, racy and simple red wine. 50% Syrah and 50% Tempranillo. 25,000 cases produced.",Spain,Syrah-Tempranillo
"Pickled on the nose, with aromas that hint at white grapes such as Verdejo. This is jumpy and unsettled, with citrus and white grapefruit flavors leaving a tangy burn on the finish. Jangled and sharp.",Spain,Rosé
"Given the high level at which Rioja is running these days, this green wine with aromas of pole beans and tobacco ash just isn't up to standards. Balance and elegance are nowhere to be found.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit tan and dull to the eye, with neutral aromas of apple cider and peach. The palate is wet, uncomplicated and simple, with basic apple flavors that some might consider to be bland. Solid on the finish, with papaya for flavor.",Spain,Viura-Chardonnay
"Sensational for the price. This die-hard bargain is loaded with berry richness, sweet pulp, coconut and balance. It's a little creamy, but generous and integrated. Smells, tastes and finishes like something that costs three times more.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Youthful on the nose, with aromatic hints of fine aged cheese and leather blended with earthy berry fruit. The palate is firm and tannic, but not hard. And the flavors of sweet berries, black plum and vanilla are hugely appealing. Coffee, berry essence and a certain chewiness define the finish. An excellent wine with regional expression that will be at its best in a couple of years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Quite well-oaked, which is the house style for Lanzaga. There's darkness, vanilla, char, leather and a bed of black fruit. The palate has a tight but nice feel to it, with fine tannic structure propping up plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors. Some expected mocha and coffee work the finish, but mostly it closes long and natural. For modern Rioja, this is well built and satisfying.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Since Torres launched Celeste a few years ago, the wine has gotten better and better with each passing vintage. The 2006 is friendly and complete, with no outlying or iffy aromas or flavors. This is textbook Ribera; it has smoothness and size along with intriguing black cherry, plum, herbs, tea and tobacco. A bottling for pretty much any wine lover.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A tiny production wine with class and style. It's toasty and dark, with bold black cherry and cassis aromas offset by ample minerality. From the town of Torroja, this 233-case wine is full of molasses, black cherry and other rich, brandied flavors. And it finishes warm, with caramel, coffee and other major-league attributes. Hold until 2010, if possible.",Spain,Red Blend
"First time we've rated this Albariño, and we love it, especially for the price. It's lightly honeyed on the nose, with accents of white pepper and peach. The palate is clean as a glass table, mildly creamy yet properly acidic. It's based on apple-pie flavors and the finish is long and plentiful.",Spain,Albariño
"Figuero's top wine is more than fine. The nose begins with meaty, leathery notes and backs them up with spice and ripe fruit. The palate is not flabby or fat; instead it's racy and features good acidity that pushes raspberry, tea, tobacco and nutmeg flavors. A more agile wine than many from this famed region. Should age well for five to ten years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Linear, strapping and tight in style, with a keen focus on wiry red-berry fruit. There's a ton of cherry on the nose, and it's definitely natural and pure, with dry raspberry flavors and a solid finish. Firm, structured and delivers a real taste of the Priorat. Not overextracted; good with food. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"A delicious wine that's entirely impressive in the way it delivers smooth, subtle citrus and honey aromas in front of a generous but controlled palate of tangerine, apple, lemon and spice. A luxurious, smooth experience, with a sexy mouthfeel and finely integrated acidity. Expensive for Albariño, but fewer than 3,000 cases were produced.",Spain,Albariño
"Reddish in color, with raspberry and other high-toned aromas. The palate is fleshy but clean, with good acidity pushing slightly sweet cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes with sugar and a good mouthfeel. Gets the job done.",Spain,Rosé
"Rubber and berry aromas are solid if standard, while the palate has freshness and bounce along with cherry, raspberry and rubbery latex. Slight amounts of heat and bitterness show up on the finish, but overall this is an entirely functional young wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"An unusual wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, Syrah and Merlot. It's floral but underdeveloped, with volatility and stunted fruit. The palate has punch and size but also saucy, herbal flavors and a leathery, salinic finish. Shows flashes but it doesn't dance in the mouth.",Spain,Red Blend
"A consistent wine from year to year that's made in a friendly, mass-appeal style. It's not so pungent and citrusy like some Verdejo; instead it's more peachy, sweet and melony. Soft on the finish but with just enough acidity to get it through the year.",Spain,Verdejo
"A bit murky and damp on the nose, with brandied fruit and raisin aromas. The palate is solidly formed, with basic raspberry flavors but not much follow through as the finish shows buttery, soft flavors. Inoffensive but more generic than individual.",Spain,Red Blend
"Nectarine and citrus aromas are solid, while the palate is more racy, sharp and linear than some, with narrow, semisour flavors of lemon and orange. Decent feel, maybe a little high in acid, and showing a pithy bitterness on the crisp finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"Not all of the new wines that we see from up and coming regions like Montsant are good. This one is a lean, burnt and minty offering with an odd baked, nutty character. Not up to standards.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mature for Cariñena, but it's still a hard wine with juniper and other narrow aromas. The palate is almost sour, with tight tannins and noticeable astringency.",Spain,Red Blend
"Modest on the nose, and then very little after that. The flavors are basic lime and citrus, and the feel is tangy and lemony sharp. Generic, with little to no varietal character.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Best on the nose, but sharp and narrow as can be on the palate. Cranberry and sour cherry flavors dominate, while the finish is astringent. No amount of swirling and saving is going help it much.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"Starts out murky, gassy and challenged, and while it does emerge from that cloud it remains little more than bargain-priced, borderline Tempranillo from an obscure central Spain region. The palate shows generic, herbal black fruit and the finish is acceptable.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bright and shimmers with purple, while the nose is jumpy and candied, with a lot of sweetness and black fruit. Marginal to tough on the palate, with racy, hard tannins and a clacky feel to go with wild berry and mulchy flavors. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Generally speaking, most Amontillados are good at their worst, but for whatever reason this wine barely makes the grade. It lacks pop on the nose and seems dilute and drab. In the mouth, the flavors strike as sour and sharp, but also musty and weak. With so many fine Sherries available, this one seems like a laggard.",Spain,Palomino
"Strawberry and rhubarb aromas get it going, and frankly that's about as good as it gets. The mouthfeel is so-so. but the flavors are funky and mealy, with a weedy bitterness that doesn't serve the wine well. Lacks purity, focus and persistence. Made from Pinot Noir.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"A strange bird with herbaceous aromas that suggest sage or juniper baking in the summer sun. The palate is acidic and sharp, with green-tinged pie cherry and plum skin flavors. Gritty on the finish, with needling tannins and a final wave of that odd juniper character. 60% Monastell and 40% Petit Verdot.",Spain,Red Blend
"A winner and a fine value from Bierzo. Luna Beberide is a model producer, and this single-vineyard wine has a pretty nose of berry, mineral, bacon and herbs. The palate is exceedingly smooth and lush, while the ripe boysenberry and blackberry flavors are classy and finish well. What Mencía from Bierzo is all about.",Spain,Red Blend
"For a big-production wine (33,000 cases) with just 12 months of barrel aging, this is impressive. Sweet but balanced dark fruit and cola aromas are nice, while the palate is forward and tastes of blackberry and cola. Complex and slightly gritty and tannic on the finish, which indicates that it has the structure to age. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Meaty, cuddly and kind is the best way to describe this big-boned, ultra ripe Toro. What makes it great is the price ($20 is a steal for this) and the complete lack of fierceness. It's easygoing but complex, with pulsing blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. With modest but measurable tannins, it should age nicely for at least five years and maybe more, making it a bargain hunter's dream.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Mildly horsey on the nose, with alfalfa, reedy fruit and grilled beef aromas. The palate is wet and lean, with good acidity and a dose of heat, while the flavors of cherry tilt toward medicinal and weedy without fully going there. Basic Tempranillo-Cab Sauvignon with a green streak.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Deep and masculine, with full-force fruit from start to finish. The palate is wide, tannic and grabby, while the flavors of floral raspberry and blackberry are deepened by mild char and chocolate notes. Rich, creamy, oaky and a little brandied on the finish. Mencía from Valdeorras taken to a modern, extracted plane.",Spain,Mencía
"Clean, dry and ripe she goes, and that's just the way we like it. The nose on this Garnacha-Carignan blend is precise and easygoing, and the raspberry flavors are pure. It finishes dry and peppery, but always there's some fruit to assure its friendliness.",Spain,Rosé
"From Bodegas Navajas, this basic Rioja shows savory barbecued aromas along with brambly fruit notes, while the flavor profile veers toward red fruits and tomato leaf. Light in terms of mouthfeel, with some finishing oak flavor. A fresh sort of wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dark cherry, raspberry, mineral and black pepper aromas start this value-driven Priorat on its way. The palate features high-toned, borderline tart black cherry and plum flavors, while the finish shows a bit of resiny oak that translates into spice and vanilla. A reasonable wine; juicy but not very rich.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Almost red in color, with sweet, juicy aromas of red fruits that bring to mind Beaujolais Nouveau. The palate is fairly unctuous for a rosado, with thick flavors of red apples, berry pie and sweet butter. For a fuller-bodied dry pink wine, it's pretty hefty stuff.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Full-bodied and pushing up against raisiny and baked, but it draws back at the final moment and competently settles into its richness and ripeness. Generous and dark in the mouth, with meaty tannins and flavors of black raspberry, plum and mocha. On the finish, there's a hint of fresh tomato to go with vanilla and leftover berries. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Spicy and dark smelling, with aromas of tar, blackberry and earth. The palate has fine feel and flow to it, while the flavors are interesting and juicy, with an emphasis on spiced berry fruit and nutmeg. Long and graceful on the finish. Drink now; it's ready.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine. It pushes the envelope on ripeness, but that's become the Cirsion way. An awesome wine that deserves a proper decanting.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe and rich, with some prune on the nose; it shows a good mix of berry and earth characteristics in front of a mildly oaky finish that holds its form. Sort of heavy and overripe but still pretty good. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big and sun-baked, with large berry aromas and flavors that come up nice but a touch hollow. Ample acidity ensures that the wine doesn't register as dull, but in the long run there isn't much substance to it; there's color, flavor and tannins but no individuality.",Spain,Monastrell
"Scattered and fading, this soft white features candied aromas in front of mango and cantaloupe flavors. Lacks snap and pop, as it finishes with a soft feel and a strong taste of banana pudding.",Spain,White Blend
"This is showing mineral, saline, spice, peach and melon—all good signs. The palate leans toward tropical, with pineapple leading the way. With no surprises, it finishes clean and a touch fleshy. An excellent Albariño that's maturing quickly. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"A unique take on Manzanilla Sherry, which is often light and sea-flecked but in this case is more amber, hazy and full. The nose is racy and spicy, while the palate offers dried apricots, orange peel and salt. Finishes with tang offsetting hazelnut and walnut notes. Oily, interesting and very good if you are a Sherry fan.",Spain,Sherry
"Spicy and a little woody on the bouquet, with ripe black-fruit aromas, a speck of mineral and a touch of cough drop. This is Torres' first commercial Priorat wine, and it's not a tannic specimen, yet the raspberry and dark-fruit flavors are sound and tasty. Finishes smooth, with a beam of acidity keeping it in balance. Drink now or at any time over the next few years.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark and definitely not reserved, this is a big blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot that pours on the rich blackberry, cola, chocolate and smoke character. A lot of powerful new oak backs it all up, leaving espresso bitterness and mocha sweetness on the finish. A modern wine with ample lushness.",Spain,Red Blend
"Overall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Àn has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors. Finishes with pepper and a lash of leftover oak that hopefully will disappear as the wine ages. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark fruit, rubber band, bacon and floral aromas give this go-to Rioja a modern outlook and a convincing bouquet. Solid, juicy and tight in the mouth, with flavors of lifted black cherry, cassis, plum, mocha and vanilla. A healthy wine that just makes the level of excellence. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Almost impossible to distinguish this nice and easy Garnacha from the winery's Monte Oton label (also rated 89). Open berry and jam aromas keep it together, while the saturated, sweet blackberry palate is living proof of Campo de Borja's sun and terroir. Ripe, deep and easy to enjoy.",Spain,Red Blend
"Garnacha is the lead in this five-grape blend, and overall it shows almost all of what's good about Catalonian wine. The nose offers sweet cherry and a whiff of hard dried cheese; the palate is racy at first and then thickens as blackberry, red licorice and fig flavors take over. A steady wine.",Spain,Red Blend
"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon. So unless you have years to cellar this wine, it will likely hold onto its hard, tannic personality. Hold another three years, if possible.",Spain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Termanthia is the pinnacle of Tinta de Toro. Aromas of wild blackberry, crude oil, forest floor and truffles are just now showing themselves, while the tight, tannic palate is full of black plum, blackberry and bitter chocolate flavors. Espresso and roast meat notes grace the dark, jam-packed finish, and as a whole this is one bold, boisterous wine. Best in 2011 thru 2013. Only 531 cases.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Having never tried this Viura-Malvasia blend before, we say it's nicely done. The nose rings of baked apple and deftly applied oak, while the palate is fresh but also deep and textured. Flavors of apple and pear are accented by vanilla and toast, and overall it's composed and shows character. Drink now through 2012. Only 250 cases made.",Spain,White Blend
"Despite its age, you can still smell sawdust, dry oak and resin on the nose. The palate is acidic and drying, with tight plum, cola and raspberry flavors. The finish warms up some, with caramel and roasted fruit notes. Nice and tasty, and ready to drink now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark in color, with density, concentration, oak and black fruit aromas. The palate is meaty and rich, with a higher level of purity and character than the Valencia region has historically been known for. Satisfying, slightly complex and with good snap.",Spain,Red Blend
"A top-flight Toro that knows how to step on the gas but keep the car centered. Aromas of dried lavender, violets, coffee and black fruit come together marvelously, while the palate is dark as Mud Cake but still loaded with tasty blackberry and black currants. Pure and strapping, and giving all the oomph that Toro is known for.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Potent and raring to go, with lots of young oak and intense fruit that causes the wine to change in the glass in the blink of an eye. What we can tell at this early point of development is that it is saturated, healthy, balanced and clean. There's vibrancy and full tannins, with lip-smacking acidity. Already a good one to ponder, but should be even better from 2009–2011. Just 750 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The Lui & William bodega is behind this outstanding Tempranillo from Toro. The wine shows a brilliant violet tint in front of intense, inky aromas of black cherry and chocolate cake. The palate is superripe and bucks like a bronco; the tannins are dense and form titanic structure, and the finish of coffee and spice hints at a fine cigar. It's a huge load at 15%, so be prepared.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Beautifully composed, with power and just as much precision and pizzazz. The nose offers lightly baked berry fruit notes, leather and spice, while the palate is loaded with tobacco, exotic spices and the finest natural berry flavors Spain has to offer. Smooth, elegant, finessed and potent, with integrated tannins and bold acidity that will keep it going for at least a decade. Drink from 2012 through 2018.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"This wine is made from old-vines Verdejo and it shows more minerality and intensity than something made from younger grapes. The nose has wax, mineral and citrus aromas, while the palate shows passion fruit and pineapple flavors. Grows on you nicely with structure, acidity and a smack of Rueda terroir.",Spain,Verdejo
"The gold tint may look imposing, and it does signal a richer-styled wine. But let this heavier, more ripe Albariño roll over your palate and you'll probably wind up liking its citrus and nectarine flavors but softer body. Finishes with apricot, kumquat and vanilla notes. An interesting wine to drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Dense and dark, with huge black-fruit aromas, toasty oak, chocolate and balsamic notes. Numanthia is ripe, rugged and intense, with in-your-face black fruit, coffee and burnt-toast accents. The feel and finish are deep as a cool well, and smooth as a whistle. Masculine to the max, and pretty close to being ready to drink. Best to hold until the fall or winter. 12,000 cases made.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"An earthy, bulky wine with aromas of saddle leather, crushed spice and raisin. The palate is snappier than the bouquet, as blackberry and plum fruit show accents of dill, herbs, leather and soy sauce. A legitimate, muscular Rioja made in the so-called modern style. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"On the spot and sweet, with black cherry and roundness on the nose. Plays above its price league via ripe plum and berry flavors, bounce, body and build. Whole, concentrated and shows good structure, depth and character. About as good as inexpensive Garnacha gets.",Spain,Garnacha
"Floral and sweet on the front side of the nose and more dark, grilled and coffee-like on the back end. The palate is more juicy and snappy than some, with no shortage of acidity. Tastes of live-wire cherry and plum, with a long, driving finish. Needs time to settle; drink in late 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big, meaty and broad, with thick, masculine coal, pepper and blackberry aromas. This marks a nice comeback for Abadia Retuerta, which had some weak wines in 2002 and '03; this single-vineyard Syrah is lush, loaded and bursting with char, chocolate and deep fruit. It has size, power and balance pulling it in the right direction. Probably better in another year or so.",Spain,Syrah
"In 2001 (the best Rioja vintage prior to 2004) this wine cost $15 and rated 87 points. Now it's $42 and it's worth it. Smooth and inviting on the nose, with coconut, toast and black fruit aromas. In a word, the bouquet is inviting. And the palate seals the deal; there's a creamy feel and loads of fruit and vanilla to fill the gaps. Drink now through 2009.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is far and away the best Mirto of all time. It's ripe and brawny, with bacon and black-fruit aromas that put it squarely into the Nuevo Classic mold. In the mouth, licorice and nutmeg flavors give character to smooth blackberry and dark plum flavors, while the finish is cushioned, herbal and long. Immediately appealing but with five to ten years of aging potential.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Complex and showing so much of what we love about Ribera del Duero. Baking spices, mature fruit and leather grace the stately bouquet, while the palate sings a pretty tune of berries, plum and brown sugar. There's thrust and potency to the mouthfeel but also a toasty, rich, mocha character. Drinking good now but should hold in there for another five to eight years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Talk about magnetic aromas of bacon, tobacco and bold black fruit, and then comes an oak-rich palate full of coconut, butter, chocolate and exotic berry flavor. Chocolate truffle and pastry work the finish, and overall this is a mile-deep beauty to drink from 2011 through 2017.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Make room in the cellar for this heavyweight! Talk about a monster wine; but there's also finesse, character and style to it. Alabaster is the top wine from the Eguren family's new Toro winery, and it's big, tannic and loaded with spice, molasses and syrupy black fruit flavors. Rich, long and fierce on the finish, with tannins and heat to resolve. Best from 2012 through 2020.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Mallorca gives us this ripe but intriguing mix of Mantonegro, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. The new oak on the nose is plentiful, and along with that there's asphalt and marshmallow. The palate is full with berry and plum flavors, and there's a fleshy and plump character to the finish. A worthy wine from off the beaten path.",Spain,Red Blend
"Ripe plum and berry aromas are on the soft and cuddly side, but have some spunk. The palate on this classic Garnacha-Craignan-Syrah blend is adequately juicy and fresh, with a basket's worth of berry flavor. And the finish is complementary and offers some chocolate as an aftertaste. Drink now and over the next two years.",Spain,Red Blend
"Youthful and exuberant, with a generous blend of lead pencil, molasses and plum/berry aromas. Torres got the perfect level of ripeness and balance in this favorable vintage, and thus this is probably as good a Merlot as you're ever going to see from the Penedès. It's full and just sweet enough. Drink now through 2010.",Spain,Merlot
"Darker and a touch more stewy than the winery's less pricey old-vines effort. Airing loosens it up, but throughout it's a big, stewy wine with extracted blackberry and coffee cake flavors. The finish is equally on the rich side, with swirling toffee and coffee afternotes. It's a big wine with heft but also some chunkiness.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark as night, with forceful aromas of root beer, menthol, warm earth and baked fruits. Maybe it's a bit soft and widespread given the heat of 2003, but if flesh and fruit turn you on and the lack of complexity isn't too disconcerting, it's a fine modern Syrah. Good with bacon burgers, steak off the grill, etc.",Spain,Syrah
"Dark, rubbery and focused on the nose, while the palate is wider, richer and propped up by a band of zesty acidity. The flavors are typical of Toro, meaning dark blackberry and boysenberry. A finish of brandied berries, kirsch and chocolate is almost like dessert.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Astrales has really nailed it the past couple of years, and while the '06 isn't quite as good as 2005, it's still an excellent wine. Blackberry, tobacco and cocoa aromas lead into a stacked flavor profile of boysenberry and plum. And on the finish it expands and brings vanilla and fudge into play. Drink now and over the next six years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Despite some spearmint and Band-Aid on the nose, this ready-to-drink wine shows good quality from head to toe. The palate is on the lighter side, with nice acidity pushing smacky, lively red plum and raspberry flavors. Hints of tomato and citrus fruits also get into play.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Powerful and precise, but with a cloudy color. On the nose and in the mouth this aged version of the venerable Drysack shows considerable freshness, tang and complexity. It's edgy yet deep, with caramel and mushroom notes going head to head with acidic intensity. Sherry is rarely more balanced than this; it's lively and rich, balanced yet racy.",Spain,Sherry
"For a few years running we've been singing the praises of Abadal, a label from Catalonia that has been producing hit upon hit. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah from the excellent 2001 vintage is in super form; the wine has a ripe, integrated nose of cocoa, dark fruit and chocolate, while the palate is bold and loaded with vivacious cherry and blackberry flavors. From front to center to back, this wine has it all going in the right direction. Good now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive. The palate is ripe, rich and just forward enough, with blackberry, wild berry, coffee and fudge flavors. Settles nicely on the finish, and overall this wine shows almost all of what's good about modern Ribera del Duero wines. 250 cases made; drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Outstanding Sherry with complexity, richness and character. The nose has a salinic zest to it, making it no wallflower, and of course there's raisin and prune. The palate is formed, sculpted and balanced, with peanut M&M;'s candy, roasted fruit, chocolate ice cream and more. A beauty with power and poise.",Spain,Sherry
"This is the tier-two wine from the Egurens' new Toro project, and it's stellar. Intense aromas of black fruit, char and mint start it out, and next up come cola, roasted black fruit, clove and cured-meat flavors. Oak is forward now, but it should settle in a year or so. A dynamite Toro to drink from 2011 through 2018.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A wonderfully balanced and giving wine with sweet raisin and prune aromas and an overall richness akin to crude oil. Flavors of baked black plum, brown sugar and molasses are both juicy and rich, and then toffee and mocha take over on the finish. Sweet and thick for sure, but with discernible fruit and vitality.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Spice, herbs, smoked meat and a dark core work in harmony on the bouquet. The palate on this well-made Reserva packs black cherry, cassis and plum, and that's followed by a stylish, smooth finish that comes on buttery at first and then settles in. Doesn't overwhelm but complements food nicely. Tasted twice.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Very colorful and properly ripe, with lush berry aromas backed by coffee notes. The palate is lush and balanced, with deep blueberry, black cherry and cola notes. A truly committed wine with a smooth, unctuous finish as the final chapter.",Spain,Syrah
"Starts with roasted, leathery aromas that feature hints of burnt beef and berry compote. The palate is layered and nicely balanced, with berry flavors hitting first and chocolate coming next. Espresso is the final act, as it ties the mouth to the finish in impressive fashion. A big load but one that's still manageable.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Dusty black cherry and raspberry aromas are true to the variety, and the buttery quality on the palate adds weight and vanilla to the berry and cassis flavors. Overall this is a structured, fairly oaky wine with firm tannins and a toasty finish. Will go well with steak.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"The earthy brick color and dry fruit aromas announce that this isn't a typical wine. The blend is Merlot, Callet and Syrah, and it hails from the island of Mallorca. The wine is a bit tough and angular, but the plum, raspberry and cherry flavors are tightly formed and fenced in by potent acidity and oak. Interesting but not for everyone.",Spain,Red Blend
"Heavily oaked and loaded down with butter and resin, this is a wine for those infatuated with the obscure. The blend is 90% Callet and 10% Fogoneu, and don't ask us to give you the history of these Mallorcan grapes. Suffice it to say that this wine is broad, a bit stewy and very different. It's not heavy like an anchor but it has its chunky shoulder pads to deal with. Only 25 cases made.",Spain,Red Blend
"An old-school wine done really well. It starts with cherry, tobacco and light coconut aromas before moving on to juicy boysenberry and citrus flavors that are boosted by CUNE's trademark acids. Muscular, wiry and structured, but with restraints. Think Barry Bonds before Balco.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The Evo '05 is composed, lively and impressive. The tobacco, coffee, leather and balsamic fruit aromas are lovely, while the berry, plum, herb, chocolate and tobacco flavors are integrated and graceful. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"This is Albariño in fine form. The nose is succulent and marble-smooth, with pure citrus and melon aromas. The palate is lively but refined, with exuberant citrus flavors that come on strong but with proper restraint. Long and ripe on the finish, which only adds to the experience. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Big in every way, with tons of new oak, popcorn and coffee sitting on top of dark-fruit aromas. Modern despite its incorporation of several indigenous grapes, this blend delivers a blast of roasted black cherry and plum flavors in front of a resiny finish that's dripping with menthol and molasses. Unique if a touch syrupy; it's clearly shooting for the modern style.",Spain,Red Blend
"Charcoal, cola and licorice are all components of this wine's dark and meaty nose. And the palate hardly disappoints; there's depth and harmony to the berry, coffee and mocha flavors. It feels good and has just enough kick to keep you thinking. A really nice crianza that will settle and only grow more complex over the next few years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit of choppy wood announces a fully oaked wine, and yes, it's a touch hard-coated. But underneath the veneer of barrel there's lively red fruit and a natural brambly character. The palate is just acidic enough to be lively, and the finish is healthy and settles upon chocolate due to the wine's generous oaking. Very good mouthfeel and depth make this more than solid. Drink now–2011.",Spain,Red Blend
"Honey and corn syrup aromas tell you this is rich, but what you don't realize so easily is how complex and expansive this Muscat is. The flavors of honey, banana and clover start out as sweet and unctuous, but then they unfurl to show depth, complexity and length. In the end you realize that this is all about pure, unrefined power and purity. Drinking it is like a rush of natural sugar to the brain.",Spain,Muscat
"Hard to believe the price on this. Yes, it's a perfectly good aged Ribera, but special it isn't. Bricky and roasted on the nose, with spiced cherry and plum aromas. The palate is healthy and comfortable, with cola, cherry and licorice flavors. Vanilla and length define the finish. Too regular to recommend at $325.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Toro is not usually a prime hunting ground for Best Buys, but this full-throttle wine is solid, gritty and tastes and smells nice. The nose is full, mildly raisiny and dusty, while the palate tastes of cola, raspberry, cherry and toast. Rubbery and long on the finish.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A purple, saturated, well-oaked, muscular wine with heavy, dark fruit and hickory aromas. Forceful and saturated on the palate, with big blackberry flavors blanketed by powerful oak. Dark and smoky on the finish, with intensity and thick legs.",Spain,Red Blend
"Nice, brawny and integrated, with sexy aromas of wild berry, dark plum, leather and earth. The palate has the right weight and tannic grab, while the flavors of black fruit, fine herbs, cola and coffee are measured yet generous. Finishes with driving chocolate and vanilla flavors. Drink now through 2016.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Teso la Monja is the new Toro winery from the Eguren family of Rioja fame (former owners of Numanthia-Termes in Toro), and it's proof that no beat has been missed since they sold out to Moët Hennessy. Expect dark, intense black fruit aromas and flavors mixed with heat, tannin, cola and spice. Some oak creeps out on the finish, but overall this is a lovely, bullish Toro. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Very nice from head to toe. The nose breathes leather, tobacco, berry fruit and spice, while the palate offers evolved, top-tier plum and cherry flavors. Exotic and concentrated, with hints of licorice. Pretty big and rich, but also quite well made.",Spain,Red Blend
"Exemplary Ribera del Duero, given that '02 was not a great year. This wine, however, pours on the richness fans of this region are looking for. The palate is lush and ripe, with deep plum and blackberry flavors supported by mocha and earth shadings. Offers a little bit of everything.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This producer is doing a very good job with its superaffordable, no-dosage cava. The nose is lightly floral, with the accent on apple blossom. The palate is solid and crisp, with appropriate white-fruit flavors. Crisp on the finish, with a lively feel. A pleasurable sipper for sure.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A gem in the semisweet category, with touches of melon and banana on the nose. The palate pours on the sweet apple cider and warm citrus, while the finish is on the mark. This is a generous, no-brainer of a bubbly: Just uncork, pour, sip and smile.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Purple in color, with a sweet, fragrant bouquet featuring mostly plum and strawberry but also a touch of rusticity. Bold and full of cherry-cola flavors, while the feel is downright plush and proper. A very nice (and new to the market) wine from Torres; and there's no knocking its value qualifications.",Spain,Garnacha
"An austere blend of Cab Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot. There's color and power galore, but also a choppy, firm mouthfeel that guards intense cherry flavors and smoldering oak. An aggressive wine that doesn't back down from its essence. Will do much better with food than by itself.",Spain,Red Blend
"Emina is a label under the Matarromera group, and this Rueda white (80% Verdejo and 20% Viura) is light, clean and a touch flowery. But mostly it pumps forth with simple orange and grapefruit qualities along with lemon drops on the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"This is an interesting wine that offers a nice perfume but limited flavors and complexity. So what makes it so interesting, you ask? Well, the fact that it's varietal Petit Verdot from the Duero River Valley, which is not common; that and the fact that it's a mind-boggling $200. The wine itself shows a deep color, vanilla and cocoa flavors, and a range of dark-berry flavors. Elegant and provacative, it's not.",Spain,Petit Verdot
"Welcome back to the classic off-dry Sherry that helped make the category's reputation. It's amber in color, with toasted almonds, citrus peel and cinnamon on the nose. The mouthfeel is solid and not too overtly sweet, and the finish is coated with burnt brown sugar. Best served on the rocks, or at least with a very good chill.",Spain,Sherry
"No complaints—just praise for this clean, easy red from a great vintage. The nose is crisp and fruity, with welcome citrus and wood notes. Blackberry mixed with vanilla and chocolate create a pleasant palate, while the finish is round and tinged by mocha.",Spain,Tempranillo
"One of the best red wines we've tried from Alicante. It's based on Monastrell, with other grapes thrown in. The result is a complex winner that smells like dark cherries and tastes like a swirl of raspberry, plum and chocolate. Very well balanced considering how warm 2003 was.",Spain,Red Blend
"The nose is all dense blackberries, while the palate is deep, flashy and ripe, with flavors of black cherry and blackberry. If you like big, bold wines, then this one should strike you in a good way; it's saturated and dark, with a touch of vanilla and mocha on the finish. Great balance for such a big wine. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Méntrida is an island wine region in the middle of central Spain, and this blend of Garnacha and Syrah is lively, juicy and delicious. The nose is deep and luscious, with mounds of cassis and blackberry. The spunky palate shows big tannins but plenty of offsetting fruit and pulp. Finishing notes of chocolate and pepper leave a positive lasting impression. Should age for several more years; 400 cases produced.",Spain,Grenache-Syrah
"So thick and rich that it seems to fall apart in the mouth in pieces. There's rum raisin on the bouquet and then backing aromas and flavors of prune, orange rind, toffee, peanut and chocolate. It's rich, sweet and unctuous from start to finish, but with just enough balance and acidity to keep it upright. Sincere and delicious.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"A clear step up from the overdone 2003 Propiedad, this vintage is sweet and easy to like. There's a blast of hickory smoke on the new-oak nose, but also black fruit and molasses. The ripe palate deals chewy fruit, medium tannins and moderate length. It's a charming but blunt wine, and all in all it's probably not one to hold for too long. Drink now through 2009.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Having never tried this producer's wines, we can only heap praise on this medium-bodied, more modern style of Rioja. Bacon, rubber and raspberry work the bouquet, while the palate is ripe and full as it pumps forth with pure red-fruit flavors. Firm and mildly tannic, with ample new oak leaving lasting flavors of vanilla, coffee and pepper. Hold for another year or so, if possible; 900 cases produced.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"These are the kinds of Best Buys we love. In the case of Muruve's '04 crianza, the wine overdelivers by a sum and a half. The nose brims with cola, tar, menthol and other dark aromas, while the big but balanced palate delivers a belt of blackberry and plum flavors along with chewy, ripe tannins. Good now with grilled meat, but will age for another five years should you want to invest in more than one bottle.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Fruit overload and gumball richness define the syrupy, super ripe nose on this Monastrell (Mourvèdre) Cabernet Franc blend from Valencia. This is big stuff, with blackberry, prune and chocolate cake qualities. It's thick, intense, tannic and will continue to be lively and drinkable for another six or seven years. A surprise wine; 100 cases produced.",Spain,Monastrell
"A Rueda white that gets it right. Pure peach and nectarine aromas lead to a smooth, pure palate of peach and apple flavors. Its purity and poise are obvious and it has that extra bit of feel and elevation to the flavors.",Spain,Verdejo
"Tough, earthy berry aromas provide a fierce outlook. The palate answers the call, showing syrupy richness amid piercing tannins. Flavors of baked black fruits yield to molasses on the short, stout finish. Tannic and solid, but very sweet. Could it use a bit more balance perhaps?",Spain,Red Blend
"Rich and pruney, with bold, reduced black fruit aromas along with chocolate and spice. Compact and delicious in the mouth, with caramel, black coffee and other yummy, unctuous flavors. So thick it pours like motor oil, thus feel free to drink it like a wine or pour it on vanilla ice cream as you might a syrup.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"This is the type of wine that's giving resurgent Jumilla a positive reputation. The nose is smoky but still loaded with solid fruit, while the palate bubbles over with pure blackberry and plum. It's a Monastrell-dominated blend, but it tastes a lot like Tempranillo, which is only 15% of the blend. Very nice overall.",Spain,Red Blend
"A classic cava from top to bottom. The nose offers familiar baked apple, mineral and saline aromas, while the palate is exceedingly fresh in its delivery of pineapple, apple and nectarine flavors. A fruity yet crisp number that foams up nicely on the palate but doesn't lose its focus or form.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Black fruit, licorice and earth are all aromas of classic Montsant, and together they are easy to enjoy and understand. Ripe black cherry, pepper and an undercurrent of licorice and coffee work the palate, while the finish sports tight acids and smooth tannins. Good now through 2009.",Spain,Red Blend
"A touch heavy, but not nearly as weighty and syrupy as this winery's '03 Excelencia. At 14%, it's a bit raisiny and blustery, but the dark plum and coffee flavors do manage to please. And the finish is full of chocolate and fudge-like residue. Big but fun; ready to be drunk now.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Keeps the Cordon Negro reputation healthy by delivering easygoing lemon-lime aromas and round citrus and apple flavors. As correct as one can ask for, this large-production cava features pure-fruit character and a perfectly good mouthfeel. For the money, we give it the proverbial high-five.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Starts with aromas of clove, Band-Aid and other spicy aromas. It has a minor herbal essence both on the nose and palate, which is typical of Spanish Cabernet. But the feel is good and chewy, while the oak is moderate as it supports raspberry and dry cherry flavors. Features 15% Tempranillo; drink now.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Borderline exotic on the nose, with aromas of black cherry, violet and a touch of earthy leather. The palate has some prickle and snap to it, but it settles into lively black plum and boysenberry. Finishes smooth, ripe and big, with medium length. The coupage is 80% Syrah and 20% Monastrell.",Spain,Syrah
"This winery's flagship red is Tempranillo-based and it delivers round, blackberry, herb, tobacco and earth-based aromas. It's fairly creamy in the mouth, with generous flavors that hit the berry and plum chords and the descent into a deep finish of vanilla, oak and herbs. Not a cookie-cutter red; doesn't taste run-of-the-mill. Good through 2011.",Spain,Red Blend
"Big and charred, but under the veil of new oak there's violet, blackberry and savory spice notes. Full throttle on the palate, with quality plum and cherry flavors. Tight and tannic late, but not overly rough. Should be at its best in 2007–08.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Over a year ago this wine rated only 86, but bottle age has improved it, and now its condensed nose of black fruit and chocolate mint chip is very pleasing. The palate is ripe and offers blackberry and cured meat, while the finish delivers licorice, pepper and a touch of salami. Proof that wines do change over time, and that sometimes we underrate the youngsters.",Spain,Red Blend
"A forward wine with earthy aromas, leather and a hint of Navarra's herbal essence. The palate is full-bodied and complete, with balanced weight and tannic structure. Flavors of dark berry and black plum are deep and mildly roasted, while the finish is meaty and chocolaty. Chivite Colección 125 is often Navarra's best red wine, and that appears to be the case in 2004.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The excellent 2005 Azul is stout and secure, with a ripe, clean and modern bouquet that's backed up by a chewy, toasty flavor profile that pours on the black fruit and character. With roundness, tannic grip and good acidity, this wine is in perfect balance and is delivering the most it can. Tempranillo, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromatically this is evocative; there's spice, tobacco and dried fruit in addition to classy, balanced oak. The palate dances with cherry, dried plum and earthy spice notes, while the finish is elegant, smooth and features just the right amount of tannic grab. A very nice, true-to-the-terroir type of Tempranillo.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With a gold glint and put-together aromas of peach, candle wax, mineral and citrus, this is very nice Albariño that's now fully ripe, mature and drinking at its best. The palate pits juicy melon against dry papaya; it's big, ripe, full and the perfect foil for all sorts of white-friendly foods. Only 1,000 cases made of this reserve-style wine.",Spain,Albariño
"Much like the 2004, this wine straddles traditional and modern lines. The nose offers light raisin, spearmint, brick dust and leafy red fruit aromas, while the palate may seem acidic and sour to some but reflective of old Rioja to others. Strong American oak accents of dill, coconut and vanilla are present on the palate and finish. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ultraripe, almost to the point of being syrupy and soupy. The nose is all sweet licorice, baked fruit and raisin. In the mouth, there's some tannic bite but mostly it's a rich, bruising, unctuous wine with smoky, rich berry flavors and a sweet, toasty finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Luzon's signature Best Buy red blends one-third Syrah with two-thirds Monastrell, and always with consistent results. Year after year, we like this wine's lusty, broad fruit, richness and overall balance. It's not sophisticated or complex, but it is deep, clean and very tasty.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dry, minty and saucy on the nose, with an old-school sheer palate full of acidity, citrus, cherry tomato, herbs and snap. Shows toasty oak, length and cheeky tannins along with red fruit finishing notes. In between new wave and traditional Rioja. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Deep purple in color, with roasted, rubbery aromas of wild blackberry. Thick, lush and rich in the mouth, with mellow tannins (for a Priorat wine) and big, broad flavors of plum, blackberry and herbs. Smooth on the finish, with black tea notes and leftover oak. Has a lot going for it; drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"A genuinely attractive, well-made old vines red with earthy, minerally aromas along with violet petal and blackberry. The palate has a fine feel to it, depth and complexity, while flavors of dry berry and baking spices work wonders. Dry, pure and long on the finish, and really quite excellent for a vino de tierra. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Slightly sweet on the nose, the aromas of baked fruit, cream soda and vanilla are welcoming. Interestingly, the wine is a bit more tart and refined on the palate, where zesty but full apple and pear flavors run the show. Not lean but definitely streamlined and acidic. More of a food wine than a stand-alone sipper.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fairly agile, floral and friendly, with precise peach, nectarine and citrus flavors. With its easy personality and good mouthfeel, this is what you're looking for in a solid, everyday white wine.",Spain,Albariño
"Shows good fruit aromas, moderate depth and a touch of sandalwood on the nose. The palate features ripe blackberry and chocolate, while the feel is cushioned and chewy. Modern in style; just a cut below the 2001.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This rendition of Segura Viudas's off-dry bubbly is nice and yeasty, with plenty of baked apple pie and buttered toast on the nose. The palate is spunky but round, with semi-sweet flavors of apples and ripe nectarines. Shows some complexity and depth on the finish as well as a richness that makes it to all corners of your mouth.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Consistent with past vintages, this crianza gets it right without setting off any balloons. It starts with raspberry and cassis aromas and backs that up with slightly citrusy red-fruit flavors. Any rawness or heat on the palate will be tamed by matching it with meat, chorizo, ham, cheese, etc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An oily, earthy wine with plenty of belt strap and dark fruit on the nose. The palate is a bit scattered, but there's ample mineral and blackberry to move it forward. The feel is choppy due to pronounced acidity, yet the finish is generally clean and fluid.",Spain,Red Blend
"Stocky and warm, with mild baked-fruit aromas and a hint of bramble. This venerable table wine is made from 65% Garnacha and 35 Cariñena, and from 2005 it's pretty much on the money. Expect earthy, mildly brambly flavors, lively acidity and soft tannins. Good for a wide range of simple foods and appetizers.",Spain,Red Blend
"A holdover from 1999, this varietal single-vineyard Cabernet offers tree bark, molasses and prune on the nose, while the palate has raspberry flavors sitting front and center, with drying tannins in support. It's a woody and grabby wine, with vanilla notes toward the end. And at eight years old, it doesn't appear as though it will improve beyond where it's at now. So drink soon.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Slightly warmer in style, with caramel and vanilla aromas, yet the palate runs more toward freshness, with orange and pineapple standing out. With its good acidity and zest, this wine won't ever be called flabby. Drink now for solid results.",Spain,Verdejo
"The bouquet delivers touches of graphite and rubber in front of traditional dried cherry and raspberry. Nice in the mouth, with softly fading fruit riding a wave of persistent acids and tannins. Snappy, old-school and succulent. Drink now through 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark and attractive in terms of color, with barrique-driven aromas of bacon, toast and roasted plum and berry. This is a ripe, meaty offering with blackberry, chocolate and warm brown sugar flavors supported by full tannins. Shows some licorice and burnt toast on the fairly long finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"There's no shortage of barrel-driven hickory, coffee and chocolate on this modern-style Rioja, but there's also a spike of green on the nose and at the core of the flavor profile. Surrounding that is bright blackberry, amplified tannins and bursting acidity. Needs air upon opening—that, or more time in the cellar.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Open-cut oak, blackberry and chocolate are the opening shots in this plump, ripe, full-bodied red that is slightly tannic and chewy but impressive due to solid plum, cherry and vanilla flavors. Delivers commendable RdD quality, but $300 is shockingly expensive.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Leans toward the modern style, with plenty of oak, bacon and plum on the bouquet. Quite upright and balanced throughout, with cherry, raspberry, cola and brown sugar for flavors. A thorough, heartily oaked Tempranillo with purity and style. Almost at the top echelon.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Full and boisterous red wine, with a ton of natural ripeness and a high pleasure quotient. We have always liked the Abadal wines, and this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend gets both sides of the Old World/New World argument right. It's loaded with dark berry and earth aromas, which are followed by cola, blackberry and chocolate flavors. An alert, acid-driven wine with enough depth to impress.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Dark and spicy, with rubber and baked-fruit aromas giving way to herbs, clove and other alluring spice scents. As might be expected from a wine bearing Alvaro Palacios' signature and approval, the final product is smart and snappy, with blackberry, herbs and barrel char all making themselves noticed. Good now and for the next several years.",Spain,Red Blend
"A firm wine with fine structure and balance. The nose is fiery and rustic early on, then seductive as it opens up. The palate exhibits currents of raspberry, cherry and plum, and below the surface there's vanilla and brown sugar. A smooth operator that shows the Campo Viejo brand in its best light.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Inky and condensed, with tough early aromas that settle on rich, sweet berry fruit. The palate has good liveliness and bullish tannins, while the flavor profile of blackberry and cassis is par for the course. Chewy on the finish.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on. Impressive depth of flavor, nice overall balance and a mix of complexity and flat-out richness make this PX a winner.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Round, stylish and wholesome on the nose, with wild berry, smoke, spice and not too much obvious oak. The palate is racy and forward, but also offers subtleties including dry fruit, spice, fresh tomato and wild herbs such as thyme and sage. Long and warm on the finish, with vanilla. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Another impressive Oloroso from Gonzalez Byass. This is a sweet, dark, brooding Sherry with prune and other sweet fruit aromas. The palate is rich but has good flow, while dark flavors of dulce de leche and burnt brown sugar are wonderful. Sweet but balanced by mild coffee-like bitterness on the finish.",Spain,Sherry
"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Patience is a must to make it through this burly, earthy, almost murky blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon. Early aromas of mulch and coffee morph into black fruit and leather, while initially reduced black cherry and currant flavors take on more character and depth with time. Never does it really shine, but it is a serious wine that has its merits.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"One of my personal favorites among the giant collection of Freixenet cavas is the extra dry, which isn't dry in the least. Just the opposite, it's loaded with sweet apple and apricot aromas along with peach, melon and candied citrus flavors. Best of all, it maintains its poise while never falling toward cloying or sappy.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Robust and dark, with plum and berry aromas that also carry hints of citrus and mineral. Overall this is a balanced specimen; the palate is round and full of bright plum and berry while the feel is moderately deep, somewhat tannic, and medium in acidity. Drink now.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A bit lighter on the nose than many, with notes of raspberry and strawberry. That same character works its way onto the palate, where raspberry and plum flavors are front and center. Fruity and balanced, with a ripe, easy-to-like personality.",Spain,Red Blend
"Hard spices, smoke and tar darken up the berry nose, while the palate is round and solid, with nice berry and plum fruit. The finish delivers a wave of blackened toast, while licorice plays from the second chair. Nicely made and familiar as RDD goes.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Dark in color, with brawny aromas of oak, clove and leather. In the mouth, there's a mix of black plum and cherry but also a streak of bell pepper. Finishes round, spicy, properly tannic and dark, with coffee and a light hint of green.",Spain,Red Blend
"Bulky and a bit stewy, but still balanced enough to earn its positive points. The palate is ripe and sweet, as it oozes with black fruit. Some might call it a touch chunky, but for the most part this blend of Monastrell, Tempranillo and Syrah registers as a highly pleasurable red.",Spain,Red Blend
"Sweet and spicy stuff, with plenty of oak-based coconut and butter on the nose. In the mouth, it's quite saturated and flush, with overt plum, blackberry and wood resin notes. A big, modern wine that's a bit oafish but also rather easy to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lots of oak gives the nose a strong coconut essence, while the flavors of baked red plum and berries bring along notes of pepper and spice. This is a meaty, hot wine with maple and resin on the finish. It shows flashes of brilliance but also ruggedness and a few clumsy characteristics.",Spain,Red Blend
"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness.",Spain,Tempranillo
A better effort than in previous years. This vintage has a tangy personality and no tricks up its sleeve. The pineapple and citrus flavors are solid and the finish holds onto the Verdejo's citrusy profile. Steady and clean all the way through.,Spain,Verdejo
"Early on the wine is dominated by buttery oak, and it's all over the nose, palate and finish. Airing settles it down, and up from the creamy underworld comes raspberry, stewed plums and chocolate. Not the thinking man's Ribera del Duero, but it gets the job done. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This Garnacha- and Carignan-based wine offers a brilliant color and a true bouquet of graphite, mineral, char and black fruit. Thus expectations are high as you head to the palate, which turns out to be sheer, acidic and hard. Amid the scour you'll pull out plum and blackberry flavors. It gets it two-thirds right; the nose and color are there but the mouthfeel is lacking.",Spain,Red Blend
"A slight step up from the Crianza, mostly because it's a level or two more intense. The nose is powerful, albeit full of earthy funk and leather. The palate is snappy and full, with black cherry dominant. Finishes warm and spicy, with cola and chocolate.",Spain,Red Blend
"Wines like this are good indicators that 2004 is indeed an exceptional vintage in RdD. For a Tempranillo that spent only five months in oak it's fairly settled. The nose is a touch syrupy but you can only love the concentrated berry aromas. The mouth is bulky but satisfying, with huge dark-fruit flavors and balancing tannins and acidity. Jumpy but very likable.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe and round, with blackberry and bacon aromas. Quite modern and full for a 2002, one of Rioja's most challenging vintages in a while. Shows full berry flavors with ample oak and a touch of tannin. Finishes with mocha and spice.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"LAN's modern interpretation of Rioja is ripe, fragrant and beefy, with mineral, charcoal, pine and black cherry coating the unctuous nose. Runs a touch soft and plump on the palate, probably a reflection of the hot '03 vintage. But along the way there's black plum, licorice, molasses and maple flavors. A big, new-wave wine that has a lot going for it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe, dark, a little oily and totally compelling from an aromatic standpoint. The palate is right where it should be, as neither the tannins nor the acidity are out of whack. Boysenberry, blackberry and plum flavors carry an herbal touch, and the finish is layered, with a lasting impression of coffee.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Purple in color and meaty on the nose, with a hint of raisin and reduction but not too much. Due to the heat of 2003, this is a ripe, rich wine with big plum and berry flavors but also good balance and feel. It covers all the bases and finishes in a smooth, solid, stylish way. Just reaches the cut of excellence.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Robust aromas of ripe berry fruit and bacon give this a full and lusty starting point, while the textured body is rich, with sturdy tannins. Flavors of blackberry and black cherry are sweet, and the wine has good character and bounce. A wine you want to drink on a regular basis.",Spain,Mencía
"Attractive, full-force plum and berry aromas with a fruity, rich, concentrated palate of black fruit and plum. Smooth, nothing fancy, and always solid for those looking for a big, full-bodied wine at an affordable price. Luzon is the definition of a go-to producer.",Spain,Monastrell
"A smooth and coaxing Sherry with almond and dried fruit aromas that lead perfectly to toffee and almond flavors. There's more dryness than fruit here, with peanut brittle accents and then a long, smoky finish that doesn't lose focus. Graceful Oloroso, with a nice individual character.",Spain,Sherry
"This is nothing more than a few barrels of wine bottled by Hughes, a so-called “global vintner.” And like its Lot 128 brother, it is really good juice. Inky and floral, with blueberry and wild raspberry flavors. It's smooth, fresh, bold and finishes with mint and chocolate. Shows the positives of Campo de Borja's Garnacha.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast. The wine is ripe and balanced, with hickory flavors adding a barbecued angle to the steady palate. Firm, structured and tasting of clove and woodspice on the finish. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Pinot Noir-based cavas are touchy; sometimes they take on a rough, peppery personality that some might find offputting. This wine does that, but only to an extent. The nose pushes peach pit and campfire aromas, while the palate features dry fruits like papaya and melon, but with cinnamon and pepper shadings. Good mouthfeel and well made, but the flavors and aromas require some getting used to.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Brick colored, with a baked, spicy nose that is true Rioja in that it also pushes Sherry, raisin and cinnamon notes. Fairly dry, acidic and zesty in the mouth, with cherry and cola flavors. Forceful acidity keeps it moving along. Needs food to absorb that acid.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Generally speaking, this wine is nicely balanced and a bit less over the top than most 2003s. The nose shows mint, fresh herbs, graphite and berry aromas. The palate is juicy, not dull or heavy, with black cherry and dark plum flavors. Finishes almost crisp, with a shot of balancing acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Deep in color, falling somewhere between copper and red. The nose is forward as could be, with raspberry and a strong hint of orange blossom. Solid across the palate, with dry berry flavors and a powerful edge of pepper. Based on Pinot Noir; you can taste the essence of that variety at its core.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"With its citrusy nose and well-balanced palate, this is what Best Buy sparklers are all about. Tangerine and orange peel grace the bouquet, while crisp flavors of berries and stone fruits win you over. A bit of strawberry and snap close the deal. Nice stuff.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Mineral, citrus, natural vanilla and grass aromas send this still-kicking Verdejo on its way. The palate is all about apple and citrus, and the feel is more polished than edgy. Seems as if it's flattening and losing some steam, so drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"Peach, nectarine and green pear aromas and flavors dominate this ripe-styled Verdejo-Viura blend. Typical of Rueda, it's citrusy and a zesty, but there's enough warmth and heft so that you wouldn't call it steely or stark. Drink now.",Spain,White Blend
"A little warmer and rounder than most. This waxy wine offers banana and melon on the nose, while the palate is just juicy and racy enough, with apple and citrus anchoring things. Finishes easy and will go well with salads and seafood.",Spain,White Blend
"Sulfurous early on, and then citrus and apple blossom aromas get into the game. The palate is ripe and tropical, with melon, mango and banana flavors. With no angularity or sharpness, this is an easy wine with soft edges. Drink now before it gets even softer.",Spain,Verdejo
"Berry fruit, vanilla and violet aromas are friendlier than the rugged, ultrafirm palate on this Syrah-Graciano blend. With food, the wine will be a strong counterpoint and will hold its own. By itself it may slip in pleasure points; the Graciano is tight as nails and adds astringency. Imported by Möet Hennessy USA, Inc.",Spain,Red Blend
"Open, round and a bit rubbery, this bright-styled wine is jammy and easy to drink. It has black cherry and blueberry flavors riding on grabby tannins, and the finish is where you get some of the “roble,” meaning oak-based chocolate and vanilla notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Brick colored, with an earthy, gritty nose that deals leather, rhubarb and burnt fruit. The flavor package is reserved and citrusy, what some might call dilute. But it's classic old-school Rioja. Finishes light, with tea and toast.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Gets off the mark with savory aromas akin to bean and bacon soup, wood smoke and dried herbs. Next comes raspberry and plum fruit supported by ample oak-based vanilla. Finishes creamy, round and solid. Just a sip or two and you know you're drinking true Rioja.",Spain,Red Blend
"Typically brick-colored and oxidized, which leads to the idea that it's 25 years old already. Unique in every way: The nose is like deconstructed citrus, sherry and leather, while the palate will seem sour if compared to most other reds and zesty if you're coming off a white wine. Hard to describe; a wine for some to admire and others to say, “What the hell?”",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Makes a great early impression via ripe blackberry and toast aromas. Overall there's not much negative to say about this meaty, fruity youngster; it has a lovely color, dark cherry and blackberry flavors, and warm vanilla and chocolate notes on the finish. Becomes more tannic and chunky as it opens; but as an easy drinker it's very good.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"The wines of Abelis Carthago are enigmatic. The lowest-priced Lui is the most balanced and complete. This wine, William, is dark and dense, with shoe polish and raw crude oil on the nose. It's super strapping and tannic, with bitter chocolate and coffee notes carrying the racy palate to a fiery finish. It lacks nuance and subtlety but will augment a good steak with nary a problem.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Caramel, molasses and spice aromas make this a totally approachable and familiar type of Sherry. The palate offers a round but zesty attack, with flavors of caramel, coffee, toffee, baked apple and orange peel. For the most part it's racy and fresh, but finishing mushroom and pepper notes give it added character.",Spain,Sherry
"There's no denying the wine's core strengths, which start with the bouquet's campfire and prune qualities and extend onto the palate, where peppy raspberry and plum flavors take over. This is a complete, stylish Rioja that's about halfway through the aging process. It's still juicy and agile, with licorice and raisin notes adding some sweetness. Drink now–2016.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe, jammy and forward, Prima could become the blueprint for affordable but well-made Toro wines. It's a modern bruiser from a modern, spotless facility, and it offers a clash of wild berry flavors, big-time tannins and powerful acidity. Like most Toro wines, it'll take your cheeks to the cleaners if you don't have meaty foods, cheese or lots of water to go with it. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Baked berry, earth and black tea aromas give this wine a solid opening, while the mouthfeel is gritty but honest. Flavors of brown sugar and lightly baked berry fruit indicate the warmth and stony soils of Cigales, while the finish hints at cassis liqueur. Drink now before it fades.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Purple in color, with extracted, rubbery, gaseous aromas that settle with time. More power than finesse here, with cheek-smacking, saturated fruit and a bit of spice. A bull of a wine with briary flavors that fade quickly on the finish. Only 300 cases made.",Spain,Red Blend
"Best on the nose, where there's a mix of caramel, roasted fruit and lemon peel. The palate is big, sticky and tannic, with salty, semi herbal flavors of raspberry and leather. Spicy and basic on the finish. A plump, simple wine. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With some toast and popcorn to fatten up the standard apple aromas, this is a fairly rich cava, especially given the price. Apple, pear and cinnamon flavors grace the palate, while the finish is persistent beyond expectations. Not overly bubbly but still lively. Strides better than your average quaffer.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"As under-$10 sparklers go, you'd be hard-pressed to find better than this medium-bodied and toasty version from Catalonia's White Castle. The nose is mildly yeasty but basic, while the palate deals juicy apple and white-grape flavors propelled by fresh acidity. Virtuous yet basic. But who's complaining?",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A little bit sweet and doughy, but hardly offputting. Deep flavors of cherry, raspberry and strawberry control the palate, while the finish is chocolaty and long. This is one easy-to-like red; it's not complex but it scores plenty of simple pleasure points.",Spain,Monastrell
"Sweet and fresh smelling, with aromas of lime, pear and peach. The palate is all about citrus, with some spice and mineral thrown in for good measure. Balanced and zesty, like Albariño should be.",Spain,Albariño
"Consistency at a good price is what this textbook cava is all about. The bouquet offers your basic fruit-cocktail aromas, while the palate is sort of plump as it pours on the nectarine and ripe peach flavors. Easygoing, with some weight and roundness.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A fuller, more minty and deep Garnacha than Hughes' Lot 129. This has standup, standout aromas followed by deep berry fruit flavors. It has plenty of body but keeps its balance, and the finish is thick and strong. A little rugged but really good by regional standards.",Spain,Garnacha
"A touch horsey at first, but with time it settles on saddle leather and earthy fruit. The palate is chunky and beefy, with some funk, chocolate and herbal black fruit. Not super spunky and lively, but dense as a brick and interesting. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ripe and attractive, with deep red fruit aromas. The palate is intense and thorough, with solid tannins supporting ripe, natural flavors of baked berries, particularly blackberry and dark plum. Subtle and smooth on the finish, with length. The blend is 50% Garnacha and 25% each Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"A potent, concentrated sort of wine with minerally, crusty aromas, smoked meat and black fruit. The palate is deep and ripe, with pure, tasty, sweet flavors of mildly baked blackberry. Generous late, with mocha and toast on the finish. Best now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bold, dark and handsome, albeit a touch herbal and earthy on the nose. The palate is thick and statuesque, with herbal, rooty berry fruit, a spot of raisin, and cracked black pepper. Chewy, deep and ultimately dry on the finish. Drinkable now; best in another couple of years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not a bad value in the Albariño category. Alba Rosa is the second wine from Martinez Serantes, and it's yellowish in color, with a pineapple and pear nose. Solid in the mouth, with touches of apple, white peach and lime. Proper acidity keeps it fresh.",Spain,Albariño
"The nose has the vintage's heavy quality, yet the palate runs toward acidic, with an emphasis on red cherry and raspberry. The more it opens, and the more the wine's tannins and acids do their thing, the tougher it gets. Food seems like a must.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cantaloupe, almond candy and orange blossom make for a sweet nose. The palate seems too close to orange juice and tangerine than the apple and peach that best defines Rías Baixas. But for anyone who likes fresh, pulpy juice, it tastes perfectly good.",Spain,Albariño
"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an ‘03, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Smooth on the nose, with vanilla and peach aromas. It's starting to fade but if you catch it soon you'll get apple, pineapple and some pithy character on both the palate and finish. Tastes wet and easy, and not at all complicated.",Spain,White Blend
"Fairly stylish and true to the region; the nose is both meaty and leathery, with rustic but composed notes of roast plum, earth and oak. Blackberry and plum flavors are convincing, while the finish offers the right amount of spice and vanilla.",Spain,Red Blend
"Plum, berry and other ripe fruits make for a solid, pure, attractive bouquet. The wine is fairly deep and plummy, with red raspberry raising the red-fruit quotient. Full and balanced, with modest complexity. Seems solid for a front-line '03.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Montsant's inherent character is nicely captured in this blend of Carignan, Syrah and Grenache. The bouquet is entirely smooth and inviting, if a bit generic. And the palate delivers ripe berry flavors that don't vary much from the fruity and basic. Call it simple or call it just right for the price; this is a fine red wine with character, balance and ease.",Spain,Red Blend
"Tropical aromas mixed with pear are just right, and overall this Treixadura-Godello-Torrontes blend is ripe and delicious. It's round but zesty, with pear, kiwi and honeydew flavors. It stays on message from front to back, and despite its size and ripeness it keeps everything in balance. Drink now.",Spain,White Blend
"Protos is a venerable RDD label that doesn't try to do too much with its wines. This youngster is tight, polished and deep, with rich, oily aromas and creamy, saturated blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. With spice and depth, it shows how good the 2005 vintage is, even for a big-production joven like this.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rather hard and lightly grassy on the nose, with a green streak running through blueberry aromas. The palate is narrow and strained for a wine of this price, with rhubarb, red plum and grass-influenced flavors. Has qualities but doesn't fully click. 5,000 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Deep black fruit aromas make it inviting, while the palate is hefty and soft-edged, with creamy vanilla-infused plum and berry flavors. Finishes with mild berry fruit but more butter and cream. Grows softer and more pedestrian the longer it airs out.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Red fruit is the focus of this zesty, rugged Tempranillo-based wine. The palate is lively and acidic, as plum and berry flavors get lots of boost. The finish is firm and medium in depth, with a stout amount of tannin. Drink now, preferably with food.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Hay, corn and buttered toast are the initial aromas, and soon after the wine settles into a pretty good groove. The palate is pure and sweet, with sticky, ripe fruit flavors that veer toward fruit cocktail and mango but never turn cloying. This wine handles its sugar like a pro.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A wave of pleasant but light cherry, blackberry and sage offers a powerful but not overpowering opening. The palate is juicy and fresh, with controlled cherry and a touch of buttered toast. Round and medium in size on the finish, with solid but correct tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Warm and the slightest bit raisiny, but overall it's a bright, fruity blend of Monastrell and Tempranillo that's tasty and worth every dollar. Flavors of black cherry and vanilla are cuddly, while the finish is long and of medium potency. A treat for those who enjoy fruity, somewhat softer reds.",Spain,Red Blend
"An easygoing but nicely made Rioja that delivers purity, good fruit, body and feel. The nose is all cherry and berry, and it's a clear step up from your everyday red wine. The palate is medium bodied, with tasty, spicy flavors of cherry and raspberry. Lasting on the finish, with proper texture throughout.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With its creamy oak and baked, stretched-out flavors, is it worth $110? You can decide, but the nose has that mildly cooked, heavy character that is reflective of 2003, and the palate is bland and drying as it mixes in oaky coconut and vanilla flavors. At one moment it's sharp and tangy; then it seems better. A confounding Tempranillo that doesn't excite.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Leathery and peanutty on the nose; soon the aromas expand to baked plum and stewy berries. The palate is sturdy and tannic, but there's enough flesh and weight to the fruit that it's mostly balanced. Finishes with bacon and leather accents.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Osborne can usually be counted on for consistency and traditional flavors. But this Amontillado is all over the map. The nose has some harsh chemical compounds, while the palate is salty like a handfull of peanuts. Shows flashes but tends to fall back into a realm best left alone. Imported by W. J. Deutsch & Sons.",Spain,Sherry
"Not every swing for the fences is rewarded with a home run. This wine, from a hot year, spent 22 months in oak. Thus it's a firebomb of dark, medicinal fruit mixed with root beer, lemon peel and creamy chocolate. Never does it really unfold or find a groove, and at times it's aggressive.",Spain,Tempranillo
"At 70% Tempranillo and only 25% Cabernet and Merlot, there's a detectable green core running through the nose and palate. Surrounding that is sizable fruit and oak, the latter of which adds dill to the fray. All in all there's enough body and soul to save the wine, but along the way it's got some issues.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dark fruit, tobacco and leathery spice make for a nice bouquet. Tight and forceful in the mouth, with ripe black fruit and firm tannins. Chocolate and espresso come on toward the finish of this thorough, flavorful wine. Satisfying but not a spectacle.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Full and raring to go. This is one lively, big-boned red. It spreads out on the bouquet in peppery, boisterous fashion before unveiling lively raspberry and other red fruits on a bulky, tannic palate. Fairly big and untamed; a year or two more time might soften it up.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Full and toasty, with roasted fruit, meat and leather on the ripe, robust bouquet. Blackberry and plum flavors are good, and the mouthfeel is manly if a bit tannic. Undoubtedly a warm-vintage wine with size but not a ton of depth. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Medium-strength plum and cherry aromas mix with earth and leather on a bouquet that's not all that fruity but still shows fruit. In the mouth, there's raspberry and red plum flavors floating on juicy, snappy acidity. Mouthfilling but hardly ponderous. Stylish in a somewhat classic mode.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With pretty flower blossom aromas mixed with lemon verbena, the nose on this Albariño is very nice. There's body and weight, but balance, too. Melon, citrus and mineral flavors are clean and satisfying, and the acidity is bright and entirely food-ready.",Spain,Albariño
"Browning and maturing, but still showing a ton of life and kick. This traditional-style wine is mildly roasted on the nose, with touches of leather, latex and other firm aromas. The palate is nice, with dry raspberry and cherry flavors finishing with power and length. Solid and respectable, but not something you'd label as special. Drink now–2014.",Spain,Tempranillo
"You wouldn't call this wine “clean and polished.” It has some old country brett along with fig, earth, mushroom and liqueur on the nose. That said, it's dishing up heavy servings of chocolate and baked berry pie flavors. A big, bulky wine that's already losing clarity. This won't be for everyone.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Rustic, smoky and deep on the nose, with a creamy body holding up commendable raspberry and plum flavors. Valenciso deals medium-level acids and tannins, with oak-based mocha and chocolate carrying the finish. This wine is so close to reaching the next level, but it doesn't quite get there.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly rooty and warm, with a nose that's one part stewy and malty and another part complex and fruity. In the mouth, vanilla and spice add character to common berry fruit flavors, while the finish is silky and fairly long. Overall this is a nice, handsome wine with balance and character. Expect to be pleased but not blown away.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Very nice for a 2002. The wine is elegant and delivers aromas of violets, minerals and dried fruits. The palate folds in chocolate and spice along with a layer of blackberry flavor. We wouldn't call it superconcentrated or complex, but it's driven, pure and pleasurable. Smells, weighs and tastes a lot like Bordeaux.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ysios is a ripe, smooth wine with polished aromas of black fruit, charred meat and vanilla. The palate has black cherry, plum, bacon and chocolate flavors, and the finish is smoky. Throughout there's a nice grilled character to the wine, which isn't very complicated and isn't likely to improve much with age. Drink now through 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This Albariño grows on you right away. The wine starts out shy and clean, almost as if it were neutral. But as it opens you'll see that citrus, saline and tropical fruit flavors emerge. By the time it's fully unraveled the wine is smooth as glass, comfortable and just right for drinking now.",Spain,Albariño
"Ripe, tropical and laced with pineapple, nectarine, green banana and melon. This is the best Don Olegario we've had in the past three vintages, and that's because it's here in the year after harvest, as it should be. Thus it's fresh, smooth and tight, with hints of petrol, pepper and citrus pith toughening up the finish. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Minty, chocolaty notes add something to the wine's floral, berry aromas, while the acid-driven palate sports zingy black cherry and plum flavors that come with coconut, vanilla and chocolate shadings, all evidence of some well-applied oak. Cleansing, acidic and nicely done for a bargain-priced wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smooth and ripe smelling, with clean berry aromas. Cherry, plum and pepper are the lead flavors, and the feel is tangy, zippy and clampy, but exceedingly fresh. Not a lot of richness, depth or body here, but it's pure, clean wine with common appeal.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Solid Mencía, but a little on the generic, bland side. The body is medium, the tannins mellow, and the flavors are your standard dark berry. The finish is easygoing but doesn't offer much pizzazz or lasting impressions. Fresh, no-nonsense Bierzo for everyday drinking.",Spain,Mencía
"Floral and a bit mineral, but also a tiny bit hot and rough. The palate is sweet, solid and slightly sharp in feel, with dark, baked-fruit flavors of plum and berry. A robust finish with a touch of burn closes things out.",Spain,Monastrell
"The nose kicks up ginger ale and a touch of lime, and that's followed by apple and mild citrus flavors. The mouthfeel is good and the finish crisp, clean and full of vibrant acidity. A perfectly fine and pleasant cava, but nothing out of the ordinary.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Full and fruity as well as dense and structured. Not bad for an inexpensive Spanish red. The palate is fairly smooth but also a tad bit juicy. Chocolate, coffee and a dryness work the palate. Even shows some finesse along the way.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lemon peel and zesty raspberry aromas greet you, and next in line comes a mouthful of sharp red-fruit flavors that are tangy and juicy. This represents the fresh, almost austere side of Tempranillo. It's also similar to most 2002s, which are more lean and tart than average.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Yeasty and round, with aromas of citrus and spent campfire. The palate runs toward peach and cantaloupe with a brown sugar coating. A bit sweet and candied late, yet mouthfilling and pleasant.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Very round and candied, with a ton of vanilla on the nose. It's made in the supersweet style, as if it's supposed to go with wedding cake or caramel bon bons. Yet there's enough balance to keep it on an even keel, which should make it perfect for those raised on candy-sweet wines and their kin. Certainly not to everyone's liking but not a poorly made wine by any means.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"When in doubt, you can always trust Dry Sack. As always, this is a powerful, rich Sherry with burnt sugar and heavily toasted coffee and caramel flavors. It's no softie courtesy of heat and acidity, and at all points it mixes its sweet side with tough, roasted intensity. Great for cigar smokers.",Spain,Sherry
"Excellent Ribera crianza here. It has a smooth, appealing bouquet of candied berry fruit, which is followed by a rich palate of cassis, black cherry, prune, chocolate and coffee. For the price point this is right on the money; it's ripe but also really good and ready to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A new take on Harveys Bristol Cream. Instead of you adding a twist of orange with the final pour, they've done it for you. But as with many infused drinks, the aromas are kind of artificial and the flavors run straight to candied and never come back. Worth a go if you like orange as a lead flavor—serve on the rocks.",Spain,Sherry
"Verdejo and Viura comprise this mineral- and pepper-tinged wine. The palate is clean but a touch blanced out and drying. Flavors of citrus, apple and banana transform into walnut and aging cider on the finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Heavily stewed and raisiny, almost to the point of no return. And while the wine is definitely cooked and starchy, it rallies on the palate and finish to show some decent Priorat-style richness and flavor. But let's face it, the wine is 80% baked and won't last for much longer.",Spain,Red Blend
"Smoky like BBQ, with dried fruits, leather and heat. Maybe a bit too exuberant in how it hits the palate; the fruit is a touch tangy and clipped, while the tannins are persistent if anything. A touchy, prickly wine that will do well with grilled meats.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Nicely done, a touch soft, but strong as a whole. The nose shows some typical Arienzo earth and stewiness, while the balanced palate is meaty but fresh enough, with good berry fruit resting on a bed of firm tannins and proper acids. Not a complicated wine; it's classic Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This Tempranillo-dominated red (it includes 25% Graciano) is oaky and drying, with cinnamon and basic red-fruit aromas on the bouquet. The palate is tannic and solid, with raspberry, plum and spice. Turns increasingly oaky toward the end, with a rush of butter. Round and generally well balanced, yet nothing out of the ordinary.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Typical Garnacha-Tempranillo rosado, with fresh berry aromas and bright peach, nectarine and apple flavors. More lean and streamlined than bulky, so you won't find much in the way of red-fruit character. Clean, persistent and fresh.",Spain,Rosé
"Light raspberry along with charred wood carries the modest nose. Additional raspberry flavors blend with sweeter strawberry tastes to create a mildly creamy, easygoing palate. Finishes fairly buttery, with toast and popcorn notes. An attempt at a major-league wine that is semi-successful.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This blend of Tempranillo, Merlot, Cabernet and Graciano has a sultry, earthy, almost minerally nose that's backed up by blackberry, cassis and melted brown sugar flavors. Chewy and modern, with a brawny finish that houses baked-fruit notes and a dash of chocolate.",Spain,Red Blend
"A big, ripe and earthy wine, with some baked black fruit and chocolate to the nose. Far more saturated and dense than Siruela's other Ribera wines, but amid the heft there's rich plum and roasted berry flavors and good overall balance. The finish has an herbal tinge.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A mixture of baked fruit, bacon, asphalt and leather aromas is impressive, and so is the bright, composed palate and its flavors of plum, raspberry and tobacco. It's crisp and zesty, which is probably reflective of the cool 2002 vintage, but still it's a very nice wine with depth and dexterity. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Muruve is a label worth watching in Toro. The wines are not as brawny and robust as some, and instead they offer more reserved pleasures. This reserva shows coconut and black plum aromas, with very ripe but structured black fruit flavors. Coffee and vanilla flood the finish, and overall the wine is raring to go now and over the next few years.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Clean and only ever so slightly waxy, with yellow-fruit aromas, mineral and floral scents all coming together. The palate is crisp, zesty and stony, with fresh Golden Delicious apple and tangerine flavors. All in all, the sum is more than satisfying. Drink as soon as possible.",Spain,Albariño
"A nice little wine for easy times. The light citrus aromas lean toward grapefruit, while the fresh, mild palate features apple and tangerine flavors but very little sharpness. Zesty enough on the finish, with a lasting taste of passion fruit.",Spain,White Blend
"Raisiny and sweeet smelling, with baked qualities but also a bitter bite of horseradish. The palate is deep and hard, with burnt notes, tough tannins and berry flavors softened by buttery oak. Beefy and rubbery, but with enough ripeness to be worth a look.",Spain,Red Blend
"Blackberry and other fruits are presented clearly on the nose, while the rubbery, bouncy palate seems properly tight and balanced. Sweet, stretched-out flavors of black plum and berry are warm and youthful. Good for basic drinking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Magenta-colored, berry loaded and fresh, all of which help what could be a pedestrian wine reach a higher plane. Sweet cherry and plum flavors mix with snappy acidity and good structure, and overall you get a refreshing, satisfying wine with genuine appeal.",Spain,Red Blend
"Round up front, with solid fruit aromas mixed with oak and vanilla. In the mouth, it features bold cherry and raspberry flavors supported by zesty acidity and bold tannins. Finishes full, with a lot of oak-driven butter. More than competent.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Deep and secure on the nose, with richness and a strong whiff of fresh leather. The palate is serious as it deals black fruit and spice. Chocolate and rugged tannins carry the hard, almost grabby finish. A power¬ful but approachable blend.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Much more spicy and nuanced than most cavas, whether we're talking rosado or not. This one begins with aromas of black gumdrops and orange drink. The palate echoes the nose as it displays star anise and Sambuca flavors along with distant citrus. A different breed that's both odd and intriguing.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Tight-grained oak on top of slightly herbal fruit gives this wine an Old World bouquet. Juicy cherry, raspberry and olive flavors work the palate, followed by an acidic, drying finish that lasts for quite a while. Lean and zesty; this has definite merits.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Open on the bouquet, with a pleasant spiciness. The flavors veer toward tangy nectarine and apricot, while the snappy finish is long and slightly bitter. Shows good citrus character and plenty of pop. Quite good for a white from central Spain.",Spain,Viura
"This is a perfectly good, fairly dark Garnacha that oozes bacon smoke and blueberry syrup aromas. The palate is mildly zesty due to adequate acidity, while the blackberry flavors carry a certain savory quality along with firm tannins.",Spain,Garnacha
"Round and balanced, with a nice mix of cherry, spice and leather on the bouquet. The palate comes across as totally fresh and zesty, with ample red fruit pumped up by acidity that creates a slight citric character. Racy and crisp wine; nice with chorizo or other basic foods.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet black fruit starts up the engine, and beyond that it mostly tastes like raspberry and plum. Quite big and fruity, with a peppery streak to the finish. Registers full but a bit tough, with some tannic bite.",Spain,Red Blend
"Big, bulky and struggling for balance. The alcohol is 15.5% and we can't say that it wears it well. The nose is sulfuric and smells quite a bit like spent fireworks, and after that match stick quality blows off what's left is mostly black fruit, extract, tannin and heat. 450 cases made.",Spain,Red Blend
Simple on the nose and like biting into a green apple when you taste it. There isn't much structure or grab to the wine; it's more like a wet wash of the mouth that finishes like ginger ale. An easy game to solve; drink now.,Spain,Albariño
"Dark in color. Cherry, raspberry and a touch of innertube rubber carry the nose toward a ripe palate featuring red apple and raspberry flavors. Finishes crisp and zesty, with nice acidity and commendable purity. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cherry cough drop, leather and moss aromas open it up, followed by red raspberry and some natural bitterness. Finishes with some gritty tannin and a slightly cooked, raisiny aftertaste. More of a throwback in style.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light and moderately oaky, with dry, herbal accents to the red-fruit aromas that are dominant. Light cherry and strawberry are the key flavors, and they're backed by notes of toast, chocolate and leather. Classic and solid, especially for a down year.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Needs ample air to shake its early stewy, earthy character, and even then it recedes into a place best described as traditional. That means the nose is rustic, leathery and oaky, and the fruit is reserved, teetering toward drying and fading. A throwback with merits and demerits.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Round and ripe, with a touch of rich prune and warm earth on the spice-cabinet nose. Fairly oaky, with coconut and raspberry flavors. That coconutty character sticks with it through the finish, which is slightly tannic.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"The aromas are powerful and just the slightest bit brambly. A little hot and rugged on the palate, but loaded with prime black fruit, pepper and mocha notes. It's a potent wine with meaty blackness and plenty of raw power. With 65,000 cases produced, it's not a “boutique” wine, as evidenced by the friendly price tag.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Consistency is apparently not Fransola's calling card. One year it's pungent and green, and then in a warm year like 2006 it's fruity, ripe and sweet, with green apple, pear and tropical fruit flavors making their mark. Seems like Sauvignon Blanc in Catalonia needs ample heat to show the ginger, lime and apple characteristics that make it a likable. In this case, that's mostly what's on display.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Crushed floral aromas, berry-infused tea and cherry candy aromas give this wine a sweet profile. The palate, however, is anything but. It pounds with toasty black fruit, licorice and fiery menthol. The feel is a bit tannic but not terribly harsh, so maybe another three to five years will serve it well.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"The essence of 2005 is captured in this creamy, rich offering that touches up against overripe but pulls back into balance at the last moment. Expect soft tannins, lots of coconutty oak and molasses notes along with a limited but easygoing finish. Drink soon.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A solid wine with mineral, white pepper and waxy fruit aromas. The palate is ripe and bulky, but also acidic enough to be balanced and stylish. Pineapple is the forceful flavor, while the finish is full and slightly oily. Drink this fruity, bigger-framed Albariño now.",Spain,Albariño
"Abelis Carthago's top wine, Fighting Bulls, is also its toughest to enjoy. There's overripeness and barnyard on the nose, and thus the prune, black plum and jammy berry flavors that control the palate are not surprising. Big and forceful for sure, but also choppy and incongruent across the palate.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Ripe and honeyed, but also nicely balanced by flower blossom aromas and acidic zest on the palate. For straightforward apricot and peach flavors, this wine serves its purpose. It's smooth, sweet and easygoing, and overall it's just elegant and lively enough to jostle your palate.",Spain,Moscatel
"Early aromas of wintergreen, pepper and autumn leaves are joined by plum and cherry sweetness on the palate. The wine opens fairly quickly into a bright, juicy, lively package that offers grabby tannins, a touch of coarseness and zest. Should drink well for the next four or five years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's no denying the wine's raisiny ripeness; it's confirmed via Sherry/Port aromas and black plum/baked fruit flavors. But it's not simply a heavyweight on its last legs. To the contrary, the wine delivers a jolt of core intensity and finishing notes of spicy black pepper and licorice. Drink right away.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Gaseous, earthy, mossy aromas are not entirely inviting, and the palate is immensely thick and round, with big, grating tannins. But the plum, berry and meaty elements are good, and the finish of chewy tannins goes on for quite some time. An extracted wine with minor balance and aromatic issues.",Spain,Mencía
"Banana, lemon curd and sawdust are the prime aromas on this oaky, creamy, candied style of Chard from Navarra. The palate is soft and modern, with decent core acidity propping up papaya, melon and green banana flavors. Resiny on the finish, but smooth.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Another winner from Emilio Moro. The nose is a touch minty and very spicy, but the black fruit element is there and overall the bouquet sings of integration. Pure, enthralling and big, with monster black fruit flavors, complexity, rich oak and a long, smooth finish. Stylish yet powerful; drink from 2013 through 2020.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Red fruit, hints of spice and a touch of herbal essence kick it off. The palate is leafy and drying, with medium-ripe cherry and berry flavors. Quite your basic red table wine, and if that's what you're looking for it's not disappointing.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Heavy, with a lot of oak, which is reflected in both the amber color and the aromas. Flavors of vanilla, lemon drop, banana and wood resin take a moment or two to get used to, but they grow on you. Not a lot of complexity or breadth, but interesting for what it is.",Spain,Viura
"Attractive on the nose, with violet, cherry and a bit of candy. Round and satisfying in the mouth, with full berry flavors and mouthcoating tannins. Not all that nuanced or complex, but good in a dense, hit-me sort of way.",Spain,Merlot
"A touch minty and rustic, but with enough black cherry, marmalade and tannin to make the grade. Jammy, medium in density and solid. A stout, friendly red made for early drinking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Warm and earthy, with a round, ripe nose. The palate is a touch on the sweet, cooked side, but it avoids being stewy or soupy and instead shows ripe black fruit, licorice and smoked meat. Quite soft and low in acid. Drink right away.",Spain,Red Blend
"A sweet, almost punch-bowl nose greets you, followed by mellow apple and tropical fruit flavors. Medium-bodied and generally balanced, with shy but layered flavors and dryness that offers a bit of complexity.",Spain,Verdejo
"Opens with rooty, mature aromas of tobacco, baked berry and raisin, while the palate is full and roasted, with sweet baked-plum and brown sugar flavors. Mature and ready to go, with head-to-toe sweetness and molasses accents. Not a hard, tannic wine. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"“Light” is misleading, because this really isn't a light fino at all. In fact, it's rather heavy and clunky, with a salty undercurrent to its lemon and nut flavors. Tastes more cooked than ideal.",Spain,Sherry
"Cola, cherry and mint aromas give reason for optimisim, but the palate is extraordinarily hard and acidic. Thus the flavors are of lemony citrus more than Tempranillo, and the feel is stark as nails. You can see certain positives but balance and mouthfeel aren't among them.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Violet and blackberry aromas are an inviting first act, while the palate is lush and fairly deep, with thick blackberry and mildly brambly flavors. Maybe it doesn't reach the penthouse, but as Ribera del Duero goes it more than makes the grade. 45,000 cases made.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dark plum aromas are sweetened and softened by oak-based coconut aromas, while the color and weight are deeper and darker than average. The palate is full, ripe, semicushioned but also acidic and vital, with black fruit, mocha and coffee notes. It finishes chocolaty, with a slight herbal note.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Not much different than the basic Sarria rosado, with maybe a touch more concentration and richness. The nose is a bit dusty, with good berry fruit notes and a whiff of cherry blossom. The palate is wet and fresh, with raspberry and plum-skin flavors. Crisp and refreshing.",Spain,Garnacha
"Forward and a touch racy, with moderate sweetness on the bouquet. Runs juicy and tight, with fresh, almost tart raspberry and cherry flavors. Offers the basics and not much more, but it's a balanced wine made in the traditional style, meaning it's dry, acidic and medium-bodied.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Traditional in the way it displays molasses, tobacco and cherry cola among its aromatics. Satisfying in the mouth, with lightweight cherry supported by oak-driven vanilla. Crisp acids are keeping it healthy. Drink now for a taste of Old World Rioja.",Spain,Red Blend
"Here's a wine that rides heavy with smoked meat and cured ham aromas. The nose is full of bacon, rubber, spice and peppery fruit and then it turns to a palate of basic strawberry and raspberry. Short on the finish, with a touch of vanilla.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bigger wine at 14.5%, this offers the full allotment of leather, crude oil, violet petals and cassis. The palate is rich and relaxed, with blackberry, plum and lightly oaked vanilla flavors. It's integrated and smooth, with a touch of wood and caramel well woven into the wine's core fabric. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The importance of a great vintage is evident in this crianza holdover from the lauded 2001 harvest. The wine is loaded with cola, root beer, molasses and leather aromas, while the flavors of earthy cherry, plum and raspberry are subtle and upright, yet still a touch angular. Will go well with food; drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Classic old-school Gran Reserva. The nose is full of barbecue, molasses and dried plum, while the palate has complexities in the form of tobacco, tire rubber and earth. It goes somewhat citrusy and quick on the finish, ending in a wash of orange-infused leather and chocolate. Drink now or hold for another 5 years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark and sultry on the nose, with aromas of burnt toast and raisin that hint at ripeness and some serious oak aging. The wine is juicy yet also a little creamy, with raspberry and plum flavors that are broad and flow nicely across the palate and onto the wide, chewy finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite ripe for a traditional crianza. The bouquet starts out on the stewy side but soon sheds its weight to reveal flavors of blackberry, black cherry and earth. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy due to the wine's mild oak and overall ripeness. Drink now through 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A good taste of Toro at the right price. The nose deals classic baked fruit, rubber and girth, while the warm, full palate shows reasonable vitality along with berry and cassis flavors. Solid and a little chocolaty on the finish. A textbook warm-climate Spanish wine.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Perfectly drinkable Monastrell year after year despite the silly name. Plum and roasted berry aromas and flavors are sweet, ripe, clean and on the generic side of the fence. A little rugged and hot at 15%, but lusty and good for the price.",Spain,Monastrell
"For the most part this is a full-bodied, full-fruited wine that has what it takes to win people over. The nose is full of cherry, plum, licorice and coconut, while the palate is bright and ripe. It's a bit clumsy and not all that complex, but you can't knock the power and extract.",Spain,Red Blend
"This is a good table wine with sweet, woodsy aromas of sandalwood, clove, cinnamon and earth. The palate turns a bit to the tangy, sharp side. But in a world with so many overripe heavyweights, this edgy, almost racy blend has the right stuff.",Spain,Shiraz-Tempranillo
"Smells a touch green and pasty, and while the wine is deep and dark, there isn't a whole lot of definition or specificity to it. Sweet and heavy in the mouth, with chocolate notes. Creamy on the finish, with minimal flavor. Not bad but doesn't have an identifiable personality.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Round in style, with soft white-fruit and apple blossom aromas. Tastes a touch reduced, as if the lemon, lime and melon flavors had been condensed and amplified. The finish is lively, with citrus and some pithiness. Good but limited.",Spain,Albariño
"Fairly big and muscular, with black fruit, cinnamon and olive notes on the nose. The palate is beefy and deep, with plum and blackberry flavors. With big tannins and a full-bodied personality, this is not a lightweight.",Spain,Merlot
"Some early pickle and sauerkraut aromas were worrisome until they completely disappeared. Left in their wake are flavors of apple juice and peaches, while the mouthfeel registers as solid and full. A little funky and definitely not for everyone, given the wine's overt sweetness and oddities.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Not a complete swing and a miss, but nothing special despite the miniscule production and higher-than-normal price. The color is pale and the nose has some gaps. In the mouth, you get dry soda crackers and white-peach flavors. Finishes with lime and apple. No glaring faults but hollow.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Fairly sweet and fruity, with notes of raspberry jam and cotton candy on the bouquet. Feels nice across the palate, with tangy strawberry and red-cherry flavors leading to a fresh, wet, bright finish. A good but pedestrian wine at a reasonable price.",Spain,Garnacha
"It's not easy to find mature Rioja from a great winery and a great year. This is all that; it smells of tobacco, earth and dried fruits. The palate is lively and not dying, while the flavors of cherry, raisin and marzipan are spot on. Compact and long on the finish, indicating that it still has another 10–15 years in it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big and sultry as always, with bacon, smoke, black fruit and a full rack of spices making for a wonderful bouquet. Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. And then comes tobacco and more spice on the finish, which is grabby but understandable because it's so young. Best from 2012 through 2019.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Once again this is a stalwart modern-style Rioja with a mix of floral aromas, licorice, blackberry and coconut. The palate is both lively and subtle, and the flavor profile shows an impressive blend of cherry, plum, cream and cocoa, while the finish is long and smooth. A high-quality wine that should impress. Drink now through 2015.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A dry, oily, piquant Oloroso that's more peanutty than almondy. The palate is racy due to no shortage of acidity, and the flavor profile is led by a salty, briney almond and leather character. Sheer and serious, with not a sugar cube in sight.",Spain,Palomino
"A bit heavy and raisiny, but with that said there's no denying the wine's richness and ripeness. Lush and dense in the mouth, with cocoa, roasted fruit and a mild syrupy lean to the flavor profile. Sweet but a little short on the finish, and condensed. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Penascal has emerged as one of those value brands that delivers. This installment of Tempranillo is full of berry, prune and leather aromas, while the palate is creamy and rather full, with smooth berry notes and more than adequate richness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fairly deep and dark, with ripe plum and blackberry aromas. Transitions to meaty black cherry and plum flavors, which are followed by a round finish accented by chocolate and mocha. Medium to full-bodied; good value in basic red wine.",Spain,Shiraz
"Perfectly nice and fresh, with fruity springtime aromas that offers slight touches of nettle and citrus. Tropical flavors emerge from the spritzy palate, while the finish is both sweet and spicy. Shows some residual sugar but not too much. Imported by HAB North America.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Talk about a colorful, bold, jammy red! It's heavily extracted and, as the label notes, young as can be. The fruit is heavy, dark to the point of teeth-staining, and tannic. Not sophisticated or meant for fine dining, but full of fruit and life. Tastes good but is unequivocally rambunctious.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mildly leafy, with root beer and red fruit comprising the nose. Basic but fresh in the mouth, with cherry and berry flavors, medium tannins and a laudable mouthfeel. Middle-of-the-road in terms of power, with finishing notes of tobacco and smoke.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard leather and smoke aromas are the opening salvo, and there's plenty of warm earth and cedar below deck. The palate is herbal and peppery, with a touch of burnt grass and green pepper sparring with plum and berry. Finishes a bit hot but ultimately it's a solid, old-school Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime. The palate is mostly fresh, though not as lively as it probably was nine months ago, while the flavors of 7Up and peach are refreshing. Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Spain,Albariño
"The “value” label from Condes de Albarei is always a good bet. Oceanic aromas and a spritz of lime make the nose just right, and the lively palate of lemon, melon and banana is charged up. Tight on the finish, with citrus and almond skins, and then a lasting impression of pineapple. Young and raring to go.",Spain,Albariño
"The under-$10 high scorer is fast disappearing, so take a good look at this young, jammy Tempranillo-Shiraz blend that hits nicely with ripe boysenberry and black plum. The Shiraz seems to have darkened the wine, and the mouthfeel is ripe and lush.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Cabernet Sauvignon and Monastrell made in a ripe, high-alcohol style results in monster aromas of shoe polish and black licorice. The palate is a wave of chocolate and candied black fruits that crashes into a heavy, ultraripe finish of prune and pepper. A lunker wine with a sweet smile and a big handshake.",Spain,Cabernet Blend
"This wine's nose bears an uncanny similarity to animal crackers, and along the way there's peach and melon aromas. The palate is sweet and slightly punchy, with mango and white raisin flavors. Overall, bank on sweetness and liquidy ripeness from this drink-now Albariño.",Spain,Albariño
"Spicy wood notes and black fruit vie for center stage on the ripe, semimature bouquet. This is more of a traditional Ribera wine, meaning it has textured tannins, notes of tobacco and dill, and leathery, earthy berry fruit flavors. Not at all rough and ready to drink now, but still it should hold into 2009.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean and focused up front, with appealing cola, cherry and plum aromas. If you like wild berry flavors and juicy, borderline aggressive acidity, then Deyo fits your request. It's a fairly rough, spunky wine with finishing notes of espresso and bitter chocolate. Should match well with salty, robust foods.",Spain,Merlot
"Mature and a little waxy on the nose; this is a plump, fruity, semisoft wine with apple, pineapple and melon flavors. It's round and fairly mild, with plenty of taste, width and drinkability. Drink soon before it softens even further.",Spain,Albariño
"Ripe grapefruit aromas take care of the nose, while the palate shows smooth-edged citrus and grapefruit flavors. For a warm-vintage wine, this one is holding in pretty well; it has a plump body but enough liveliness to do what it should with food. Drink now; it's not getting any better.",Spain,Verdejo
"Big boysenberry aromas are lively, a bit minty and fresh, while the extracted palate has a fruit-driven personality, ample tannins and dark wild-berry flavors. Young, bouncy and tangy on the finish. Composed for a young, inexpensive red.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with sweet berry and plum aromas and later there's earthy heft. The palate is big, acidic and fruity, with bold, stretched-out berry flavors. Finishes with a touch of bitterness and rubber, but overall it's a perfectly solid, grapey, tightly wound wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Decent and quaffable but does not compare to the winery's Verdejo. This is prickly and full of pine needle, juniper and other sharp aromas. The palate has a good feel but pickled, briney flavors. Skeletal given its warm-climate origins.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Raspberry and rubber aromas are solid if not refined, while the firm palate is sweet and full of black cherry flavor. Rough, tumble and unsophisticated in the mouthfeel department but ripe and tasty throughout, with dark shadings on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A pure and intense rendition of Priorato. The nose is stacked with minerality, smoke, ink and tough but regal black fruit aromas. It's powerful and concentrated in the mouth, with bold cassis and blackberry flavors in front of a long, flavorful, slightly lemony finish. Needs a few years to show its best; drink from 2011 through 2017.",Spain,Red Blend
"A big-time Priorato with tobacco, minerality and dark fruit aromas in front of a lush and smooth palate full of cola, blackberry and licorice flavors. There's all the power you could ask for but also complexity and layering that set up a minerally finish of mocha and coffee. Drink from 2011 through 2015.",Spain,Red Blend
"For years this wine was a big-time bargain from Navarra. Now it's not so inexpensive yet the quality is the same. There's common nectarine and raspberry aromas before snappy peach and berry flavors. It's juicy and modest, with crispness and a drying finish.",Spain,Garnacha
"Light and modest in aromas, although scents of citrus blossom and nectarine manage to work their way to the top of the bouquet. The palate is smooth and creamy, with flavors of red plum, melon and chocolate. A good wine that won't make you go crazy looking for complexities and depth.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Plump and full of plum and licorice aromas. Weighs in big and a touch sweet, with black cherry and ripe plum flavors. Very soft in the feel department, with a soft finish that's like a cushioned fall. Healthy as a whole, with lively tannins.",Spain,Grenache-Syrah
"This full-bodied, cherry-dominated Garnacha is pretty good considering the price. The nose is a bit raisiny and ripe, while the palate is sweet but balanced. A standard red wine with clarity and no surprises.",Spain,Garnacha
"This Monastrell-based rosado is indicative of the Jumilla region, meaning it's sweet, a bit heavy, and fairly candied in its aromas. Flavors of fleshy raspberry and strawberry are full, while the round finish is neutral. Low in acid; drink right away.",Spain,Rosé
"Sweet and floral, like light berries with crushed flower petals. The palate is not as comforting; it's acidic and bouncy, which fosters good flavors but a jagged, jumpy mouthfeel. You want to like this wine but the feel doesn't make it easy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pretty good for a $6 sparkler, even if the nose has a whiff of rubber band and wet clay to go along with light citrus and cherry aromas. The palate is fruity and carbonated, so you get spritz with your cherry, strawberry and tangerine flavors. Good for sparkling Sangria as well as casual sipping.",Spain,Rosé
"Earthy and crusty at first, with smoked meat, black fruit and dryness to the nose. The palate is well formed and proper, with dry raspberry and mild chocolate flavors. Finishes peppery and solid, with the slightest herbal note. Very nice wine to drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A super sweet, potent brew that takes no prisoners as it hits with powerful toffee, caramel and alcohol aromas. Good in the mouth because it's not gritty, but very sweet on the palate, with honey, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors. If sweet is your thing, then add a point or two to our score.",Spain,Sherry
"Having really liked this wine a couple of years ago, this vintage seems comparatively fierce and aggressive, which isn't to say it isn't hugely flavorful and aromatic. On the down side, it's residue-heavy and tannic, with full extraction and tannic berry fruit. Tough as nails; maybe it just needs a couple of years to settle.",Spain,Mencía
"Opens with rich aromas of raisin, licorice, black plum and molasses that put it on the cusp of overripe. The palate is rich and gritty, with deep berry and molasses flavors. Generous for sure, but also slightly baked and sweet. Tastes like a warm-climate, warm-vintage wine. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Raspberry and plum aromas carry a mild floral, perfumed accent, while the palate is medium in weight, with good flow due to lively acidity. Flavors of red fruits are equalized by oaky vanilla and dry herbs, while the finish is lengthy and snappy due to aforementioned core acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A touch timid in how it doles out slight raspberry and light oak aromas. And that's in front of a mellow, quiet palate that offers basic berry flavors and not much more. Far from the most cushioned, lush wine going; it hits firmly and evenly, like a welterweight from a past era.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Basic, fresh and fruity, with floral aromas that capture the essence of clean, tank-made Viura. Flavors of melon, banana and papaya are easy to like but not that serious, while the finish is soft and creamy, but not very intense.",Spain,White Blend
"Once again this Viura ranks as one of the better values in white Rioja. It deals a punchbowl bouquet of round melon and pineapple, while the dry but fresh palate pushes green melon and white pepper. Limited in what it can offer but good for what it costs.",Spain,Viura
"Encouraging aromas of earth, leather, plum and berry lead to a rather sheer, zesty palate of blackberry, cherry and acid. It's tight in the mouth, with cheeky tannins and friction. Quite extracted and oaky; requires food or will seem astringent.",Spain,Red Blend
"For years Ysios has been one of Spain's most architecturally astounding wineries, but its wines have lagged. This is not a new wine, so it falls into that simple, basic category. It's aging decently, showing citrus, root beer and tobacco. Good but midland.",Spain,Red Blend
"A sniff delivers aromas of dried fruits along with a smack of toast and char. Runs light to medium across the palate, with cranberry and raspberry rising as the primary flavors. Definitely a flyweight made in the traditional style. A new release that seems more mature than it is. Drink right away, preferably with food.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Easy and fruity, with light cherry aromas. Juicy on the palate, with raspberry, apple skin and plum flavors. Zesty as they go, with good natural acidity and ample freshness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"In general O. Fournier gets it right, be it in Spain or Argentina. But this Ribera del Duero struggles from the outset. It's rubbery, damp and lacks clarity of fruit. And the feel is sharp and lemony, seemingly a combo of excessive oak and raw fruit. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Light but generic aromas of white fruits and white flowers give this wine a happy bouquet. The palate is starting to tip toward fading, but if you get at it soon you'll find perfectly nice peach, melon and citrus flavors setting up a soft, easygoing finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Just a bit mulchy on the nose, which signals that is a wine from the hot 2003 vintage. The palate sits on raisin and mocha, and there's even a creamy, thick feel to it. If you like rich, Porty flavors that border on dessert, it's likable. But be prepared for it to hit with a thud.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Inky dark, with deep berry, sandalwood and sawmill aromas. Color and potency are not lacking in this modern-styled Tempranillo, which hits like a hammer. Feelwise, this is a tough, angular wine that will benefit from another year or two of aging. Now it's very tight and tannic, with piercing acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Castilla y León can be good bargain country, and all of the 2006 Volteo wines are Best Buy qualifiers. This varietal Tempranillo has a clean, fruity nose backed by bright berry flavors built on a floor or two of structure. It's a composed quaffer with pure flavors, adequate length and overall balance.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smoky, grapey and spicy on the nose. The palate is full and aggressive in a bring-it-on sort of way. It's a touch heavy and tannic, but it's also pretty long and toasty on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Seems like the brutal heat of 2003 got to this wine in a negative way. The result is a thick, unctuous, syrupy wine with a ton of sweetness but not much balance. The alcohol is listed at 15.5%, and it seems bigger. Very much a heavyweight, and with no agility.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Apple and peach define the bouquet, but where's the pop? This cava seems a touch quiet and reticent. It's drying, with flavors of apple, white corn and soda cracker. But the bead is weak and the overall personality is shy. Has 15% Chardonnay in addition to the traditional cava three-pack of Macabeo, Parellada and Xarello.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Sweet cherry and berry aromas are blended with cookie dough scents to create a simple, easy bouquet. The palate is a bit lean, with tight red-fruit flavors and a blast of citrus essence. Shows some kick and tannins at its core.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Slightly amber in color, with pastry, peach and pear aromas. The palate is tangy, with flavors of green apple along with some bitterness. Finishes light and dry, with zest and freshness. Simple yet solid.",Spain,White Blend
"Really nice and lush, with an aromatic mix of tobacco, baked fruit, mocha, vanilla, shoe polish, earth and more. It displays a ripe, friendly feel and yummy flavors of mocha, chocolate and savory, subtle berry fruits. Layered on the finish, with lasting notes of fig, mocha and blackberry. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Radiator dust, baked apple and other familiar, semirich aromas grace the nose on this more elevated Cava. In the mouth, there's chunkiness, weight and integrity along with a flavor profile that hints at vinegar but settles on cidery apple and kumquat. Nicely done and different from the mass wines Freixenet is known for.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Solid if a bit soupy and tomato-driven on the nose. In the mouth, there's a nice offset between herbal, red fruit characteristics, tobacco and black fruit. Overall, it's a gritty, tight, honest Ribera wine with a long, powerful finish. Just ripe enough, with indviduality and identity. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with exotic, earthy aromas and lots of black fruit, but it turns more quiet and timid with airing. The palate shows plenty of bright acidity and some heft and grab, while the flavors of dark berries and plum are accented by light herbal notes and other common Ribera accents like thyme and oregano.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Slightly dusty, spicy and cider-like on the nose, with a tight palate holding nectarine, melon and apple flavors. It's fairly exact in terms of mouthfeel, while the finish is clean and reflects well on the wine. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"For an affordable Priorat this wine isn't disappointing. The nose is a bit funky and gamy, but you'll also dig out mineral, leather and bacon notes that are pleasing. Peppery and spicy more than lush and fruity, with pushy game and herbal notes on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"An organic wine with brushy aromas of tobacco, bramble and berry. Fairly true and full in the mouth, with a note of raisin to the black cherry and plum flavors. Gets better with time but always seems a bit grassy.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A zealous wine with sweaty leather, prune and leftover oak on the nose. The mouth is charged up and lively as the tannins and acids meet to boost cherry and raspberry fruit. Comes across too eager and hard; needs more mouthfeel and subtlety to make the next level.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Murkier than ideal. The nose is heavy and earthy, and it's full of barnyard initially. The wine rests heavily on the tongue, with soft, mildly funky flavors of dark berry and stewed tomato. Seems a touch overripe and flaccid for an '01 reserva.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"This wine kind of misses the mark. The nose is a bit stewy and less than pure, while the palate seems tight, grabby and herbal. At times it seems like it's almost where it should be, but then you find weaknesses.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rusty in color, which is to be expected. The nose shows dried cherry, belt leather and cigar box, and at this point all seems dandy. The palate, however, is short and stewy, with too little fruit to stand up to the prickly acids and herbal notes. Already past its prime.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light salmon in color, with fruity, relaxed raspberry aromas. Melon and peach flavors are pleasant but dilute, while the wine weighs in a bit watery and devoid of stuffing, even for a rosado. Finishes dry but flat. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Spain,Rosé
"Gets off the mark a bit chunky and soft, with heavier than usual peach and melon aromas. Melon, papaya and green banana carry the plump, full-bodied palate to a soft, easy, almost shy finish. Weighty for Verdejo.",Spain,Verdejo
"Despite the silly packaging and strange orange tint, this is a solid if unusual rosado that registers sweet but likable. It's chunky, with berry flavors and a shot of leather and animal. By no means is it elevated or for the long haul. Drink now or hold your peace. Imported by Winery Exchange.",Spain,Rosé
"Nice and familiar, and very much in the sweet, creamy style. There's almond candy and caramel on the palate and then maple syrup on the finish. Soft and sweet throughout, with just enough acidity and complexity to save it from being boring.",Spain,Sherry
"This is Cáceres' bread-and-butter red Rioja, and the '04 is fruity, light and very approachable. The nose shows some cotton candy and other bouncy red-fruit aromas, while the palate is easygoing, fleshy and balanced by a beam of juicy acidity. Along the way, you'll pull out flavors of cherry, raspberry and a finishing note of bitter coffee.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Superripe, such that it's medicinal and pruny. The nose reeks of reduced blueberry and cassis, while the palate is soft, low in acidity and full of ripe, dark raisin, prune and spice cake flavors. If you like a dense wine, this is it. But expect it to be Port-like and on the liqueur-ish side. Drink now.",Spain,Petit Verdot
"A maturing wine with aromas of burnt leaves, dill, leather and shaded black fruit. It opens up on the palate, revealing cherry, raspberry and plum flavors along with ancillary vanilla. With medium tannins and moderate acidity, the wine shows no ill effects of the broiling 2003 vintage. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate. It's a holdover from 2005, so drink it while you have it.",Spain,Albariño
"Neutral for the most part, with a slight citric pungency. Tastes like apple, spice and dried papaya, and the feel is round as opposed to zesty or angular. Lasting on the back end, with a final note of grapefruit.",Spain,Verdejo-Viura
"A little rusty in color, with earthy, stemmy, baked fruit aromas mixed with a dose of dried leaves. Seems a lot like Cabernet Franc with its herbal, leafy overtones and dry plum and cherry flavors. Finishes short and herbal, but with good feel and flow.",Spain,Tempranillo-Merlot
"The nose shows buttered popcorn, toast and baked apple, while the palate is tangy and tastes of tart white fruits, green apple and toast. Has good flow and a cleansing feel to it. Not bad for an oaky blend of Viura and Chardonnay.",Spain,White Blend
"Floral, sweet and not the least bit complicated or strained. This is easygoing red wine for easy times. It's a bit candied and baked, but that's Garnacha from Central Spain. Decently balanced and sturdy, especially given the price tag.",Spain,Grenache
"Medicinal black fruit aromas are a little burnt and brambly, while the palate is snappy, acidic and tannic, with tomato, raspberry and oak-driven creaminess. Finishes dry, with a lasting flavor of vanilla that tempers overriding acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Round and sweet up front, with aromas of candied berries. More alert and red-fruit dominated on the palate, with snappy acidity keeping it well propped up. Finishes with bright acidity and modest tannins. Straight-ahead red wine with crispness.",Spain,Shiraz
"Black raspberry and raisin control the bouquet on this carbonically macerated wine from inland Valencia. Lively plum and black cherry work the rubbery, mildly tannic palate, while the finish is leisurely enough. A touch narrow in flavor but broad in feel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Albariño is not known for its aging potential, and this wine already seems to be on the way out. The nose veers toward apricot and cider, as does the palate. Finishes with a final kick of acidity. Drink soon, or wait for the 2005.",Spain,Albariño
"Jammy and full of raisin, stewed berries and leather. Calling it ultraripe might be an understatement because it's nearly over the top in its heft, extract and tannin level. A high-production bruiser that has tons of power but very little precision.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Hits with force as well as notes of raisin and Sherry. No doubt this comes from a hot vintage, evidenced by the prune, brandied cherry and chocolate flavors. Still there's some tannin to keep it moving ahead. Overall, however, it's pretty heavy and condensed.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mildly floral and tropical at first, but then it seems to go heavy and flat on the bouquet the longer it sits. Look for decent grapefruit and tangerine flavors on a healthy but rudimentary cassis.",Spain,White Blend
"The color is an odd orange, which should come as an indicator that not all is right with this wine. The bouquet starts with dust on a warming radiator, and there's some vanilla as well. Soft citrus and nectarine flavors work the palate, followed by a round but somewhat mushy finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Staunch red fruit aromas are a bit prickly at first, but within a few minutes they settle on mineral, herbs, anise and licorice. The palate has a firm but pure feel, and the tannins aren't too tough at all. Flavors of cassis, cherry cough drop and raisin are deep yet narrow, and just complex enough. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"Another great Tempranillo from Sierra Cantabria? Indeed it is. The nose bleeds cedary, sweet black fruit aromas and coconut, while the palate is pure and layered, with a lush feel and rich flavors of black fruits and chocolate. Long and lasting on the finish, and delicious overall. Approachable now but ageable for at least five years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Thoroughly modern in style, with an oaky nose of campfire, spice, vanilla, sawdust and molten berry. The palate is solid and shows good vital acidity, while the flavors of blackberry are meaty and thorough, with hints of coconut, chocolate and cream. Seems a little more balanced and interesting than FB's richer, softer Selección.",Spain,Red Blend
"Concentrated and sweet, with a baked, raisiny richness that maintains its clarity. The palate is dense but not punishing or tannic. Flavors of blackberry and prune veer toward syrupy, setting up a sweet, generous finish of fig paste and coconut. Modern-styled Rioja done right.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A complete modern Rioja with cola, cassis and smoky aromas. Excellent mouthfeel and toasty black fruit and licorice flavors work well together, and the finish is refined, warm and peppery. Not an overly lush wine but it is generous and loaded with a bit of everything good: body, tannin, acidity, flavor and complexity. Drink now through 2014.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A bit sweet and raisiny on the nose, but also dense and powerful. The palate runs rough and tannic, but there's enough richness and extract to allow for that. Flavors of cassis and raspberry are dark but snappy, while the finish has raisiny notes but also some edge. This one may improve with time; drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts out a bit sweaty and leathery, but soon it turns more smoky. As a whole it's more bulky and barnyardy than most PX wines, with sweet prune and raisin flavors that seem a bit generic. Thick on the finish, with a gooey sweetness throughout.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Dusty, creamy, powdered sugar aromas are nice and easygoing, while the palate has balance and a mouthfeel that caresses solid apple, citrus and peach flavors. Crisp on the finish, with a decent amount of elegance for a $15 wine. Hard to go wrong with this bubbly.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"The best new release in the Eguren family's collection of modern Rioja wines is this small-production, 100% Tempranillo. It's a true nuevo classico with proper touches of smoked meat, herbs and sweet black fruits as well as a lush, round mouthfeel that culminates in a mile-long finish. Destined to rock your socks off. Just over 300 cases produced. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"As expected, the wine exhibits a dense black color, with mineral, burnt toast and dark fruit on the bouquet. The flavor profile offers cured meat, leather, graphite and plenty of blackberry, mocha, caramel and coffee. Beautiful modern Rioja. 4,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark as night, and dominated by meaty plum and beef jerky aromas. The palate is huge, with pure fruit, tannin and chocolate pooling at the finish. A new classic in every sense, with stellar balance and complexity. Less than 400 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The bouquet explodes with tobacco, leather, dry oak and waves of berry fruit. In the mouth, the wine sits comfortably on the tongue, with firm tannins offering structure to the bedazzling boysenberry, black cherry and cassis flavors. Long and intoxicating on the finish. It's 90% Tempranillo and 10% Garnacha and Graciano. 650 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Meaty and composed, with an earthy nose that carries plenty of dark fruit and minty herbal accents. The palate shows clarity and density, but it's a touch gritty, hard and tannic. Flavors of cola, blackberry and burnt toast are masculine, while the finish is also kind of crusty and dark.",Spain,Garnacha
"Earthy black cherry aromas give this easygoing Rioja an honest and true nose. The palate is almost what you'd call flush, but on the other hand it's snappy and fresh, with commendable black cherry and plum flavors. With a touch of oak and mocha on the finish, it's a complete wine that should come across familiar.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of olive, tobacco and dark plum are satisfactory and convincing. It tastes of black cherry and other berries wrapped into a short, stout package. Finishes simple.",Spain,Shiraz-Tempranillo
"Grapy and granular smelling, with heavy, raw aromas that lack finesse and agility but offer plenty of thump. Surprisingly, the palate on this dark, more modern-styled wine is kind of tart, with racy cherry and blackberry fruit. Not an easy wine to evaluate; you want more from it but it isn't that generous.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Typically dry and leathery, with only modest red-fruit aromas. It's light to medium in weight, with punchy acidity pushing clean but thin cherry and plum fruit. Not too big or spacious on the finish, but good in a mainstream, traditional sort of way.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Light in color; almost transparent. The nose is largely as the color suggests: light and leathery, with old-school character. Leafy red fruit dominates the palate, which is dry and controlled by crisp acidity, tannin and spice.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts with lightly roasted aromas of herbal fruit and pepper, while the palate is deeper and more pure, with raspberry, cherry and cranberry flavors. Finishes medium in terms of power and length, but short on complexity. Good in a basic sense, with proper balance.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells like slow-roasted fruit mixed with a dusting of savory spice. Not the freshest kid on the block, but it offers cherry and apple-skin flavors that are decent and smooth. Not a thriller but not bad.",Spain,Red Blend
"Funky, with earthy, heavy aromas. Seems a bit rubbery and peppery, with cola, plum and olive flavors. Tannic, too. Not nearly as fruity, clean, ripe and pleasing as the 2001.",Spain,Tinta Fina
"Traditionally leathery, with earth and bramble on the bouquet. The cherry, raspberry and cola flavors on the palate are aggressive courtesy of sharp acidity, while some wayward oak-based butter and vanilla rises up late on the finish. Like many in its class, this wine needs food.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Salmon in color, with creamsicle aromas leading to cantaloupe and peach flavors. Runs juicy on the palate, with lean fruit, perky acids and a bitter-almond finish. Slight of frame and less than generous, but stable. A blend of Garnacha and Tempranillo. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The chunky fruit aromas are like chewing gum, while the palate is punchy and drying, with tannic black cherry and cranberry flavors. Sheer on the finish and slightly astringent, but serious for a big-production wine.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"An obscure Catalonian wine made from indigenous grapes, this pricey oddball starts with bubblegum and candy aromas mixed with smoke and meat. The color is dark and the wine is a bit rough. But in a country, unusual way it redeems itself with zippy cherry flavors and a fresh, tight mouthfeel. Best with food.",Spain,Red Blend
"Earth, leather and tomato are accents to the dry, lean bouquet. The wine is expectedly juicy and tight, with snappy raspberry and cherry flavors. It shows clean lines and an unbreakable personality; elegant, juicy and firm. Drink now–2009.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty and still fairly fresh, but with that said this wine was certainly more in its prime six or eight months ago. Now it is slick but softening, with peach and citrus flavors doing their thing without much edge or kick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Generic peach and melon aromas are pleasant, clean and simple, while flavors of pineapple, melon, mango and kumquat are basic and sweet, almost like canned fruit salad. Finishes pithy, with some banana-like sweetness.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Wild, foxy and full of young, bursting berry fruit. There's nothing tamed or refined or special about this youthful Tempranillo. The flavors of plum and berries are intense, bright, grabby and modest in what they deliver. Consistent wine from year to year.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts with earthy burnt aromas, but in short time cassis and berry aromas rise to the surface. Fresh and tangy feeling, with spunky red fruit and tomato flavors. Finishes a little saucy, with more tomato and an herbal aftertaste.",Spain,Tempranillo-Shiraz
"Smells like cherries and fruit punch. The palate is snappy and simple, with red fruit front and center. Shows a tiny bit of wood on the finish, but overall it's a tart, lean wine that grabs at the palate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Brawny plum and blackberry aromas feature notes of bacon, rubber and leather, all of which lead you to expect big, ripe flavors. But the news is, those flavors aren't anywhere to be found. The profile is tangy and lean, with sharp berry notes. Quick and simple on the finish, with aggressive acidity and tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A wine searching for an identity. The nose deals menthol, licorice, grilled meat and molasses but little-to-no bright fruit. That heaviness transfers to the mouth, where marinated, baked flavors mix with green tomato. Fails to impress.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Functional and fruity, with big aromas of plum and berry on the slightly foxy nose. Fully tannic across the palate, so it feels kind of hard. The big berry flavors are loud and basic.",Spain,Merlot
Light raspberry and strawberry aromas lead into snappy berry flavors. The feel is almost astringent; call it tangy and tight. Juicy but also rubbery. Shows both positives and negatives.,Spain,Tempranillo
"Far more lean, raw and rough than ideal, with a touch of burnt field on the nose. The palate keeps that raw, reedy taste, which is smoothed out by softening oak notes. Better on the finish than up front.",Spain,Red Blend
"It has been a few years since 2001 was a current vintage, and while Montsant wines can age, this one doesn't seem to be going anywhere in particular. The nose is overdone with heavy mint, menthol and cinnamon-driven oak, while the palate is jumpy and tannic. Not a cheap wine, but also not that great.",Spain,Red Blend
"Earthy fruit aromas, blackberry and cola flavors and a soft, saturated finish all add up to a flush wine typical of La Mancha, where elegance is fleeting. And while this fruit-filled middleweight isn't off, it's not that alluring either.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This wine is Cáceres' attempt at a modern (yet for the masses) Rioja, and frankly it's not working. The bouquet is nothing but an avalanche of coconut and butter, which stems from the barrel regimen the wine goes through. And the palate is loud, chunky and clumsy. Yes, there's big fruit and bulk; but it's grabby, oversized and overoaked.",Spain,Tempranillo
"After a couple of vintages of really raving about this Merlot, the '02, from a cool, wet vintage, just isn't that great. The nose is dominated by rhubarb and sharpness, while the palate offers peppery flavors and a rough feel. Plenty of olive on the finish brings ripeness into question.",Spain,Merlot
"Somontano is not exactly prime real estate among Spanish wine regions, but Blecua, a four-grape blend led by Cabernet Sauvignon, is one of the best wines the region has to offer. Smoke, licorice, rooty cola and lemony oak aromas mix with flavors of blackberry, coffee, cola and roasted meats. It's a bit choppy and hard now, but time will help it along. A classy wine to drink from 2011 through 2016.",Spain,Red Blend
"A rewarding wine that isn't overly pricey or difficult to enjoy. Dark, lightly baked aromas hint at raisin and marshmallow, while the palate has a deep texture and vital acidity. Savory, tea-infused flavors bring pulse and kick, and as a whole it delivers a true reflection of what Ribera del Duero should be.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Earth, rubber, spice, oak and bold berry aromas give this a classic Ribera nose, while the palate is pure and sensual, with shining raspberry, strawberry and plum flavors. Control and poise are on display, and the finish is clean, dry, warm and satisfying. Will be better in two or three years; best from 2012 through 2018.",Spain,Tinto Fino
"Dense and spicy on the nose, with tobacco, baked fruit aromas and dry, woody notes. It's a fairly rich, slick and generous Rioja with lightly baked berry fruit flavors, spice cake accents and limited complexity. Solid on the finish, with additional spice notes. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A touch gritty and baked on the nose, and that ripe character persists throughout this semimodern Ribera wine. Along the route there's raisiny notes, baked plum flavors and oak-driven vanilla and spice. On the finish, vanilla is the lasting flavor. Solid and oaky, with some pushy coconut.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean and vibrant, with citrus blossom and apple aromas. The palate is a bit neutral in flavor but shows good cut and a cleansing feel along with tastes of spiced apple and white nectarine. Finishes clean and pure. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Classic in color, and backed by aromatics of lavender, graphite and pure blackberry. This is not overly weighty, as the acidity keeps it pointed and pure. There's a lot of elegance and balance to this wine; a perfect example of how to blend multiple vineyards into one excellent whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Masculine and heady stuff, as leather, espresso, smoked meat, mocha and intense blackberry aromas set the stage for an intense, driven, structured palate that's full of coconut, vanilla bean, cocoa and pure plum and berry. A serious nuevo classico Rioja if there ever was one.",Spain,Tempranillo
"What a superb combination of new oak, leather, mineral, mocha and berry fruit this wine delivers. It's a giant, with a ripped palate of upfront boysenberry and then coffee and vanilla in support. All the power, precision and other attributes of modern Rioja are on display. Best in a few more years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Full and ready, this fabulous wine from Rioja Alavesa sets the bar very high for any of its Vanguardia co-runners. Gloria hits hard with bacon, tire rubber, tobacco and pastry crust aromas, but also pure dark fruit. Then it's wave after wave of boysenberry and crisped brown sugar flavors prior to a finale of heady European chocolate. Need we say more? 750 cases produced; best now through 2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Plant-by-plant fruit selection leads to intensity, concentration and structure. Aro shows gripping tannins and juicy acidity, and overall it reeks of power and precision. At this young stage it seems like it could last forever. In reality, it should be just right in about seven years. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Only a select portion of a prized 30-year-old vineyard gives fruit to the wine named after the Eguren brothers' great grandfather. It's rich, ripe and impeccably balanced, with a brilliant dark-purple tint and an avalanche of finishing toast, chocolate and tannin. Hold until 2009. 330 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"One half of the wine is lush and opulent, the other juicy, fresh and pulsing with the essence of old-vines Rioja fruit. So for every note of molasses, burnt toast, chocolate or baked berry pie, there's a twinge of acidity, a spike of tannin and a dollop of earthy terroir. Tempranillo with 15% Graciano. 500 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly tighter and more complex than previous years, this single-  vineyard wine delivers a ton of spice and herbs on a masculine bouquet and palate. Well-blended acids and tannins allow for it to be drunk now or over the next five to eight years. About 4,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is yet another magnetic example from the Eguren stable that includes El Puntido, San Vicente, Finca El Bosque and the many Sierra Cantabria wines. It's a racy, red-fruit dominated Tempranillo with raspberry, plum and cassis flavors accented by firm, almost blazing acidity. It's definitely tighter and more compact than the more generous, richer 2005 La Nieta. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Round, mossy and deep smelling, but austere in the mouth. A berry and plum flavor profile is infused with tomato and herbal notes, while the finish is long, healthy and cleansing. Very sturdy and Navarran in every sense because it blends juicy fruit with cool-climate typicity. Good but not for fans of sweet, bulky, superripe reds.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Pleasant but a little light on the nose, with candied fruit notes. Flavors of green melon, apple and citrus are standard fare and clean, while the feel is fresh and peachy. A balanced and nice wine, but not overly exciting or precise. Drink now with salad or fish.",Spain,Albariño
"Although this wine has been favorably reviewed in the past, this vintage seems jammy and ponderous. The color is blinding and the bouquet reduced and jammy. The palate pours on monotonous boysenberry and blackberry, while the finish is granular. A specialty wine (only 250 cases made) that proves why Graciano is rarely made by itself.",Spain,Graciano
"Chunky but also lively, with pungent, aggressive Sauvignon aromas of prickly fruit, grapefruit and greens. The palate is heavy and all about pink grapefruit, while the texture is thick. Has its good points; and it's varietally correct.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Mildly green and brambly, with touches of tomato and raspberry on the full, sun-baked bouquet. Yet in the mouth it's tart, pushing red cherry flavors onto a palate that's lactic and creamy. Settles late to show some fruit and subtleties.",Spain,Red Blend
"Tomato and rhubarb are present on the earthy nose, which isn't very fruity but does set the stage for solid raspberry and cherry flavors. Medium to light in weight, with a slight barnyardy, herbal quality to the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark, with a heavy warmth to the nose and lots of earth and toast. Comes on more racy in the mouth, with snappy red-cherry and roasted plum flavors. Gets harder and harder as it opens, displaying heat and tannin. Needs better balance and cushion.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Cherry and baked fruit carries the nose, followed by more cherry and some oaky vanilla. Plump but flat in terms of feel, with stewy finishing notes. Never finds much of a groove.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite a bit different than the bodega's Flor de Grealo prestige bottling; this wine is a touch stewy, with molasses and braised-beef aromas. The palate leans toward unctuous and syrupy, while the finish is flatter than ideal. A blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"See-through in color, with leafy, earthy aromas that turn more oaky with time. Almost citric in flavor, with tart, lean raspberry and strawberry flavors. Clean but missing potency; juicy nearly to the point of sour.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Hard apple and lemony aromas lead to a stiff palate defined by tart green apple, underripe pineapple and green herbs. More acidic than desirable, with a clean finish.",Spain,Viura
"A lean and peppery style of Rioja that's very much from the old school. Red fruits such as raspberry and pie cherries steal the palate, giving the wine a tangy sensation and a spicy, almost sharp feel and finish. Very young and fresh right now; it improves with patient airing.",Spain,Tempranillo
This Macabeo (Viura) blend is neutral on the nose but fairly big and bulky on the palate. Flavors of lemon-lime and banana are spritzy at first and then stickier late. The rest of the composition (Macabeo and Parellada) dictates that the flavors will be short; but what's on display is nice and creamy.,Spain,White Blend
"A powerful berry-based wine with no oak is what's on offer. The nose exudes rubber and leather at first, and then comes a wave of rambunctious black fruit. The palate is bright and packed, with ripe plum and cherry flavors. Shows good mouthfeel and chewy tannins. And once again: no oak!",Spain,Tempranillo
"Persistently murky and leafy on the nose, this traditional-style Rioja brings juicier, brighter fruit to the palate along with some tangy, somewhat sharp acids. In the folds, a dash of oak brings vanilla and additional tannin into the picture. Improves with airing.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of milk chocolate, cotton candy, bacon and sweet fruits are a lead into standard fare cherry and raspberry flavors. The feel is acidic but fresh, while the finish is thin but clean. Average wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with black cherry, baked plum and other heavy, semiroasted aromas. The palate is chunky but weak on definition and structure, while the flavors are limited to dry red-apple skins and bland red fruit. Acidic as well, which leads to a washed-out finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pure and driving, but also acidic and woody in aromas and flavors. Can't say that this barrel fermented Viura-based white is Muga's best wine. It's crisp with green apple and pineapple, but also a little sour and simple. With 10% Malvasia.",Spain,Viura
"Vanilla and a lot of oak blend with baked apple on the nose, while the palate is grabby and resiny, with drawn, oak-heavy flavors of baked apple and vanilla. For a winery that rarely misses with its red wines, this is one that's o.k. but probably not worth the money.",Spain,White Blend
"Opens with generic berry aromas and a slight candied, gaseous undercurrent. The palate is modest and lean, with decent raspberry flavors and not a whole lot of follow through. Basic and a bit rubbery.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Begins with a sweet marshmallow creaminess on the nose, which is followed by a firm, tanninc palate with snappy cherry and raspberry flavors. Clean and easy to understand, but in the end it's a very regular wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Briar and rhubarb aromas suggest stemminess, but the palate is fairly clean and clear, with tight, rubbery tannins supporting red fruit flavors of cherry and plum. Short, rubbery and unexceptional, but good enough despite a whiff of green that's probably due to the Cabernet in the wine.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Bold in color, with a stewy nose that oozes raisin and licorice. The palate is heavy, with bacon and reduced berry flavors. Flat and a touch burnt late, and in general it's in dire need of an infusion of acidity.",Spain,Syrah
"The bouquet mixes bramble and berry notes, which turn rougher and more vegetal as time passes. The palate is peppery and light, with just adequate cherry and berry flavors. A light, distant wine with some similarities to Beaujolais Nouveau.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Soft aromatically, with notes of pear, vanilla and banana. Surprisingly, the palate is short and tart, with sharp citrus and pineapple flavors. Entirely basic and lacking punch. Already seems to be in decline and it's brand new.",Spain,Albariño
"Light melon and vanilla aromas are simple yet muddled, while the green melon and lemon flavors are not overly generous but acceptable. A narrow wine with a lean figure and protruding acidity.",Spain,Verdejo
"Woodsy and smoky up front, which sort of hides the fact that there's very little fruit on the bones of this wine. On the palate, it's peppery and firm, with spiky tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Short and slightly chemical on the nose, with hard-to-define melon, citrus and apple flavors. A tart wine without too much going on.",Spain,White Blend
"Light reddish in color, with dry cranberry aromas and a strong hint of spearmint. Surprisingly heavy in the mouth, with slightly cooked flavors and a wave of burnt brown sugar on the finish. A wine with some issues.",Spain,Garnacha
"This Navarran winery usually does well, but its '02 Crianza isn't up to snuff. The nose is clumsy and jammy, while the fruit is underdeveloped and dull. Acceptable on its best day.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dark and crusty aromas of black fruit, wild black truffles, coconut and lemon peel are pure Priorato, while the tight, tannic palate provokes salivation as it delivers firm black cherry, dark plum and citrusy (lemon) flavors. Finishes with coffee and coconut. The definition of a harmonious Priorat red. Drink from 2011 through 2016.",Spain,Red Blend
"Impressive for the way it blends modern richness with authentic aromas and flavors. The nose offers prune, leather, blackberry and fine dried cheese, while the palate is savory and smooth, with chocolaty, round berry fruit flavors and then additional chocolate and toast on the finish. Lively and dense, but not heavy. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An oaky, modern-style wine with a staunch mocha and vanilla influence, but the fruit is ripe and rich enough to handle it. Spicy and grainy on the nose, with vanilla and resin seeping through. The palate remains woody but is full of berry flavors, while the omnipresent barrel influence carries onto the rich, ripe finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A very pretty middle-aged wine that has at least another decade in it. At this point in time, the nose is still showing a lot of black-fruit aromas, while the palate is chewy, meaty and rich as it spreads out with ripe flavors mixed with touches of mushroom, truffle and vanilla. A fine Gran Reserva with equal bits of tradition and modernity showing through.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Beautiful in color as it blends hues of purple and red. The nose is endowed with leather, herbs and cherry, while the full palate houses a delicious range of fruit and wood flavors along with fine tannins and length. It's like a new-school classic with a traditional name and packaging. 1,250 cases made. Good now thru 2016. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose. This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character. Drink now through 2010.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Right away this shows the requisite signs of excellence. The meaty, earthy, leathery, full-fruit nose is just right, and the palate is elevated in how it is infused with pure blackberry and plum as well as chocolate and fine herbs. Finishes with class and kick. Best from 2008–2011.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Like all young Sierra Cantabria wines made from old vines, this has a purple color that's supported by aromas of coffee, mocha and black fruits. It's half aged in American oak (the other half is French), and it's much more tannic, acidic and structured than the fleshy 2003. A wine with pure flavors and a dynamic structure. Just under 1,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Benjamin Romeo makes nothing but big, idiosyncratic wines. And some are big hits while others may not be your thing. This modern, round, polished blend is creamy and smooth but also loaded with almond, pear, citrus and toast flavors. Certainly there's a strong wood element, but it handles it with aplomb and oozes class. Drink as soon as possible. It won't age much past 2007. Only 25 cases made.",Spain,White Blend
"Robust and sexy, with smoke, leather and pure berry and plum aromas that make for a sensational bouquet. The palate is up to the precedent set by the nose, as the cherry and cola flavors are outright lovely. For what you get, this is almost a value. It shows us what that Muga can do in a great vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Stylish and serious, with polished, fancy oak sitting like royalty atop dark   fruit that is almost pruney. The palate hits with a solid smack of blackberry, while a secondary layer delivers chocolate, mocha and spice. Not quite at the level of the classic 2001 but still excellent.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Berry, earth and a touch of citrus peel make for a good bouquet, while the palate shows structure and lots of verve. The flavor profile of plum, cherry and roasted berry is solid and complete, while the finish is fresh, clean and reaches a proper finale. Call it a well-made but familiar type of old-vines Garnacha.",Spain,Garnacha
"Clean, fresh and layered up front, with peach, cherry and nectarine flavors and then apricot on the finish. The feel is good throughout, with no excess weight or sweetness. An uncomplicated, no-frills rosé, which is what Navarra and Señoría de Sarria do best.",Spain,Grenache
"Interesting blanco from the inland Galician region of Ribeira Sacra. It's Albariño with 15% Godello, and it's ready to drink now. Aromas of pulpy peach and pineapple are nice, while the apple and lime flavors are fairly gentle and flush. Finishes with adequate freshness for an '07, making it a no-qualms type of white wine.",Spain,Albariño
"Light red to brick in color. Starts out spicy and leathery with more rhubarb and bramble than, say, black fruit. Tastes largely of raspberry and strawberry before finishing with caramel and a touch of toast. Simple.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Savory and spicy, with a lot of tree bark, licorice and dry red fruit. Quite hard and rocky on the tongue, with jagged tannins and raw acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite rooty and earthy, with brandied cherry aromas. Not too pure and fruity, as green bean and carob creep onto the palate. Finishes a touch dry and tannic. Seems caught in Neverland.",Spain,Red Blend
"Olive, roast plum and heavy berry aromas lead toward modest boysenberry flavors that show some weediness. The finish is tannic and hard, with a touch of red fruit as well as a burnt characteristic.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Quite brambly, with a persistent burnt character that sticks with it from start to finish. Along the way there's cooked cherry and raspberry flavors supported by strong oak notes. Fails to improve in the glass; in fact it's just the opposite, as it falls apart.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Mild butterscotch aromas blend with sweeter fruit-cocktail notes, while the flavors run tangy and short, with an emphasis on lemon and green apple. Dry and lean late, with ample snap and freshness. Simple.",Spain,Viura
"Rubbery yet light-bodied, with distant berry and burnt-wood aromas. Seems dilute and more acidic than ideal, with crisp fruit flavors that run tart and zippy. More of a wake-you-up wine than something rich and plump.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Losing color and steam; the nose already is showing sherry, root beer and other oxidized notes of tobacco and caramel. Tastes of rooty fruit, earth and some citrus peel. Has seen better days.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Piercing wood intersects with cherry aromas in front of a lean, scrappy palate that features short raspberry and cherry flavors. Quite tangy, zesty stuff with no off flavors but nothing to write home about, either.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pickled aromas are obvious on the chunky, warm bouquet, and never does the wine shed its green personality. The palate offers brown sugar and baked fruit, while the finish leaves an impression of carob and green bean.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Saucy, with overt oak aromas that manifest themselves as espresso and charred beef. Fairly acidic and thin across the palate, where pie cherry is the dominant flavor and sourness mars the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Solid as can be, with sweet-styled aromas of berry syrup and tire rubber. In the mouth, the wine shows juicy cherry and raspberry flavors in front of a lively finish. Throughout it shows good form and a bit more roughness than the Volteo varietal Tempranillo or the line's Tempranillo-Shiraz blend.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"It's hard to rate an aging, oxidizing, barrel-fermented Verdejo and take into consideration the wine's faded qualities versus its complexities. If you like dried apricots, dehydrated mango slices and fruit jellies, then this will tickle your fancy. Adherents to the school that believes whites should be fresh and palate cleansing should take a pass.",Spain,Verdejo
"This tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors. Roundness and a smooth feel work in the wine's favor, because there's just enough acidity to push the length on the finish. Drink right away.",Spain,Sauvignon
"Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character. The palate is nothing special; there's citrus and pineapple before a medium-long finish. Solid but not the most expressive Albariño out there.",Spain,Albariño
"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.",Spain,Verdejo
"Opens with decent dusty apple and peach aromas, but they don't really hold together for long. And the palate is similar in that it offers adequate opening flavors of green apple and citrus but no improvement after that. Drink right away; it won't age well.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"More soft and milky than exact or pungent, with bitterness intermixed with apple on the palate. Feels a little soft and bland for such a young Rueda white. Perfectly drinkable but uninspired.",Spain,Verdejo
"Pithy, heavy and chunky, with waxy fruit mixed with oak. The wine has a pretty good mouthfeel and balance, but it just doesn't do much in terms of aromatics or in the flavor category. Decent for a barrel fermented Viura but nothing to write home about.",Spain,White Blend
"Raisiny and baked on the nose, with a syrupy consistency to the palate. Along the way there's stewed fruit, baked blackberry pie notes and overt sweetness. Candied, ultrarich and tilting toward molasses on the finish.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Not a lot to latch onto here. The aromas are sharp and sweaty, while the palate feel is more dull than it should be, while flavors of melon and pickled fruits are briney.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Brambly red fruit, leather and a strong whiff of dill pickle create a less than welcoming nose, which is backed by tart red fruit that carries a roasted overtone. Oaky and tomatoey throughout, with a lean mouthfeel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lean and peppery, with more citrus than berry on the nose. The mouth is a bit grabby, with a starchy feel and far-reaching tannins. Clearly not a great wine but it holds itself together.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Hard and jumbled up front, with slightly harsh peppery notes interlocking with light raspberry fruit. A light, airy, almost innocuous wine with mild bitterness on the finish. Doesn't impress.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Grenache that can only be described as strange. The nose is stewy, the palate full of root beer, baked berries and syrup. It's even cloying on the finish. Yet through all that there's still a little something redeeming about it.",Spain,Red Blend
"Reddish in color and plump on the nose. The palate, however, deals only light cherry and dilute berry flavors. Inconsequential on the finish, with little character overall.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Jammy and sweet on the nose, like a jar of strawberry preserves. The palate, however, is light and tart, with burnt berry flavors. Finishes peppery and short, with little to latch onto.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Medicinal and chalky on the nose; tart and lively, with acidic cherry and plum flavors. Short on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Almost volatile with its cooked rhubarb and berry aromas. Screechy black cherry and raspberry flavors don't really help it along. Simply a hard, closed-down wine that isn't up to its price tag.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Deep and dark on the nose, with licorice, cola and prune aromas. The palate is chunky and full, albeit a touch soft. Saturated flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate define it as a rich, modern wine, and the finish is appropriately creamy and stacked with sweetness and depth. A lush blend of Garnacha, Cabernet and two indigenous varieties. Drink now through 2011.",Spain,Red Blend
"Opens with earth, tobacco, briar and nutty aromas. This is now aged to its best state, and while there's still some tannic bite, it's at a straightforward, mature place. Flavors of roasted plum and spice are classy, and the finish is reflective of a fine vintage. Drink now or in the near future.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark and dense, with aromas of rich black fruits, grilled meat and a lot of oak. The palate is extracted but it's not the least bit hard or biting. Flavors of Concord grapes and blackberry are sweet, and the finish keeps its fruit. Could it use more minerality and toughness? Maybe, but as is it's very approachable. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Sweet smelling, with a touch of pastry. Focused, lean and nice in the mouth, showing dry apple and citrus peel flavors. Solid Cava that brings a modicum of leesy, pithy richness on the finish.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Jumps out of the chute with baked, earthy, funky aromas that are more savory and spicy than outright fruity. The palate has a good but limited mouthfeel, while the flavors of raspberry are spicy and saucy. Good in a subtle, earthy, nonfruity way.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark purple in color, with a jammy nose of berry fruit and coconut. The palate is concentrated, a little narrow and sharp in the center, with snappy, pointed cherry and berry flavors. Fruity but sheer wine, with dashes of nutmeg and cocoa powder on the finish.",Spain,Tinta Fina
"Comes across a bit baked, syrupy and sweet on the nose, with a hint of stalkiness and stem. The palate has a lush early feel, but further inspection unveils a hollow core. Flavors veer toward earthy raspberry, while the finish is chunky and properly reflects what came before it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"It has taken this bodega a few years to get it right, but in 2004 this blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet is dark and rocking. The nose offers that modern but increasingly familiar blast of bacon, baked fruit pastry and leather, and the palate works its magic with black plum and smoked game flavors. If it were just a touch longer and richer toward the finish it might rank as a nuevo classico.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Cuatro implies four grapes blended together, and the nose on this Tempranillo/Cab/Merlot/Syrah mix is a bit leathery and tight. In the mouth, it's linear and borderline lean, with plum and bramble flavors backstopped by tomato and herb notes. Juicy, intense and solid, but not overly generous or evolved. Typical Somontano red wine.",Spain,Red Blend
"Gold in color with nondescript aromas of wheat and apple. Turns to tart on the palate, with lemon and green-apple flavors. Adequate at best.",Spain,Viura
"A barrel-fermented wine with soft, lactic aromas that conjure memories of a bowl of cornflakes. The palate is dry but rather tasteless except for some distant melon and citrus. Finishes bland.",Spain,Viura
"Smells fairly solid, with plum, prune and leather. But the palate is ultrasweet and milky, with a strong candied essence that doesn't impress unless your thing is chocolate-covered cherries and vanilla. Way too expensive for what's in the bottle.",Spain,Garnacha
"Heavy and green, with nutty, leathery aromas. Rather candied and less than fresh in the mouth, with a weedy underbelly on the palate. Finishes herbal, minty and burnt, but with a lot of size and power.",Spain,Red Blend
"There's a lot of raw power on this jumbled red that starts with rubber and spice before settling on maple. The mouth is a cacaphony of loud flavors, while the finish is stark. Needs finesse to match the aggressiveness.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Stewy, with red cabbage and field funk on the nose. Limited in scope, with tart plum flavors along with a persistent infusion of green. Acceptable mouthfeel and balance are what save it from a worse fate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A raisiny wine of the first order. The nose is stewed, while the pruny palate is soft and chocolaty, mostly because there's no detectable acidity. Only late in the game do you catch some tannin and zest.",Spain,Garnacha
"Overly soft and deep in color, with heavy caramel and red licorice aromas. With no edges and little acidity, the wine seems flat. In addition, it finishes with bitterness as well as sugary sweetness. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain.",Spain,Grenache
"Damp and foresty, and seeming old before its time. Raisiny fruit with clove and anise accents are acceptable but heavy. Tannic and bulky.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A little baked and flat smelling, with licorice and stewed fruit aromas. Sounds kind of dark and heavy, right? But the palate runs to the thin side, with lean but pure raspberry and cherry flavors. Vitality and snap are its virtues; not much depth or character are its fallbacks.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Magenta-tinted and ready to go; that in a nutshell is this easy, no-oak blend of Tempranillo and Grenache. It's fruity to the max, with aromas of boysenberry and black cherry as well as similar flavors. Ripe and easy to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dusty and neutral on the nose, with a hint of wild flower and mineral to stir interest. The palate is dry despite having some size and plumpness; flavors of apple, peach and papaya are crisp and lean.",Spain,Muscat
"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.",Spain,White Blend
"Oily and pungent, as if the cat were not let out of the house. But airing reveals a wide spectrum of green, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables. There's passion fruit, green pastures and some citrus in this varietally typical Rueda SB.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Years ago Rívola was one of Spain's standout value wines; but over time it has devolved. This version is mulchy and muddled, with heavy roasted fruit and red pepper aromas. The palate is grabby, rubbery and roasted, and raisiny notes work their way onto the flavor profile and finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"Creamy and confected on the nose, which is proof of the “roble” designation. The palate is rather narrow and acidic, with semi-sour flavors of berry and cherry. Cleansing and tart; decent but doesn't go beyond that.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smells like bath soap, then turns grassy and burnt. Tannic and medicinal in the mouth, although better as it airs out. Tastes and feels overdone and super sweet.",Spain,Garnacha
"Decent mass-produced Ribera del Duero. Strawberry and raspberry aromas lean you in the red fruit direction, and the palate is scouring, acidic and full of cherry fruit. Fresh on the finish and hard, but at least it doesn't have off flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Austere, green aromas are about as much as one can pull from the nose, while the palate is fresh and acidic, but lean. Flavors of lime, citrus and pith are zesty at first but pithy later on. Dull and strained, but not bad for Chardonnay from central Spain.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Young wild berry, cherry, rubber and cheese aromas lead to a big, rubbery, loud palate of plum and raspberry. Herbal notes, moderate sweetness and simplicity wrap it up.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Too sour, strained and vegetal to rally behind. The nose is grassy and green, while the palate tastes of sour apple, gooseberry and lemon. Turns citric, mustardy and a little like asparagus on the finish.",Spain,Chardonnay
"The label says it: fermented in barrel. And one sniff delivers the buttery, toasted character of a Burgundy or California Chardonnay. Underneath the oak, there's fine acidity and blazing apple fruit, and once it finishes you get a finely baked aftertaste. An interesting, elevated mix of Treixadura, Godello, Loureira and Albariño.",Spain,White Blend
"The opening of peach, mineral, honey and wild green herbs is alluring, and the palate runs smooth and full, and also a little soft and mature. Banana, papaya and melon flavors are pretty and the finish holds its stature. Not as minerally and tight as some; this wine has sweetness and depth. Drink soon.",Spain,Godello
"A treasure at this price. The nose is impeccably clean, with tropical fruit and honeyed melon aromas. Elegant in the mouth yet there's also just the right acidic pop to liven up the melon, kiwi and apple flavors. A pure, fruity ride. Treixadura, Torrontées, Loureira and Albariño comprise the blend.",Spain,White Blend
"Coconut and vanilla aromas ride front and center on the oaky nose, although berry fruit rises up with time. The palate is bulky and saturated, almost what you'd call thick, while the flavors lean toward roasted berry, plum and woodspice. Vanilla and additional wood accents work the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Round and generally attractive, with raisiny richness that emerges with airing. The palate is more snappy and acidic than the nose might suggest, with herbal raspberry flavors. That same acidity lifts the finish, and overall the wine is fresh, racy and not that complex.",Spain,Tempranillo
"From Viña Mayor, this French-oak-aged wine is composed and dry, with good plum and berry aromas that bring balanced oak as well. The palate sports proper weight and balance, solid berry and plum flavors, and a warm, minty finish. Not mind blowing but good for a weak vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"With its spice and fig aromas, this registers as a rich, mature Rioja reserva. The palate runs toward sweet plums and blackberry, while the finish is mildly toasty and full, with coffee as the lasting flavor. This has many good qualities, not the least of which is balance and a touch of citrus peel. Best now–2010. 525 cases produced.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A sweet, ripe, jammy style for Roda I, with smooth tannins, corpulence and more than adequate minerality and power. This is not a flabby wine despite the heat of the vintage, and the lush cassis, blackberry and mocha notes come together on the back palate and finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Thick, brooding and aromatically mature, this delivers heft, grab and balance. It has developed black-fruit flavors followed by a cushioned, soft finish. Drink now and over the next several years as the 2001 gets better and the promising but not yet released 2004 begins to settle. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"You're going to like this masculine, well-oaked blend of 80% Tempranillo with 10% each Graciano and Garnacha. It's got modern touches but a lot of tradition as well. The wine is rich and round, with tobacco, coffee, chocolate and earth creating depth and character. With fine mouthfeel and a solid finish, you can drink now or hold a few more years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This seems eminently ageworthy; it has the strong foundation and pulsing acidity required of a true cellar dweller. The raspberry and plum fruit have a beam of acidity and the tannins are not shy. Shows all the hallmarks of a fine modern Rioja: power, purity and balance. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A dense wine from the start, and each subsequent whiff of the oaky but vital nose is convincing. The palate here is exemplary, especially for an '02; there's dark berry and plum flavors backed by notes of black licorice and pepper. An exceedingly nice wine with a textbook mix of tannins, flesh and acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Oddly aromatized, with strong hints of hickory and sweets. The whole wine is a strange mix of clove and distant fruit. Finishes with weird notes of spiced tea and rubber. Made from 95% Garnacha. Imported by The Marchetti Co.",Spain,Grenache
"Heavy and waxy, and not all that likable. Weighs in as a dull, acidic white with a boring, sour disposition.",Spain,Viura
"Wheat and corn aromas announce the soft, oaky personality that this wine brings to the table. Grainy and heavily oaked, it sits on toast, vanilla and creamy, buttery flavors without offering any serious fruit or style.",Spain,Viura
"Interesting and unique blends get bonus points, but in the long run this conglomeration of indigenous grapes from Mallorca is a touch too resiny and bland to really deserve a call out. But for soft melon and pithy flavors, and the fact that it's made from the obscure Prensal and Muscat, we like it well enough.",Spain,White Blend
"A warm vintage (2006) may be causing this wine to expire prematurely, but tasted in 2008 it seems to be losing its drive. The nose has wild flower and melon aromas, while the palate shows simple apricot, pineapple and mango flavors. The tropical notes are here, but the texture is watery and as a whole it doesn't go the extra yard.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Approach this simple Tempranillo with modest expectations and the jammy cherry aromas and flavors will strike you as pure and fresh. Complexity and style are not part of the equation, but an unoaked raspberry character, length and correct balance make it worthy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar. Still, it manages to push tasty apple cider, papaya and other fuller-bodied, less acidic flavors.",Spain,Verdejo
"Rusty colored and flat on the nose. Aromas of medicinal fruit and horse hide are less than stellar, and the soupy palate of weak raspberry and faux sweetness doesn't do much to improve things. Needs more vitality and overall quality.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Starts with nutty, oily, acrid aromas, and never is there much fruit character. The palate has bite but still seems short on acidity, and the flavors run toward funky citrus, asparagus and green beans. On the global scale of SB, this doesn't really cut it.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Generic fruit, hard rubber, olive and leather on the nose. Dry and tannic, with bitter black plum and a rock-hard finish. Tough and just not that much fun to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"One of the strangest-smelling wines we've encountered from Spain: there's forced cinnamon, heavy funk, dampness and other unfamiliar, foreign scents. The palate has weight and a gritty feeel, while the core flavors are Sherried. Hard to see the appeal here.",Spain,Red Blend
"Funky, sour, gumball aromas and flavors, and then not a whole lot else. Short on character, with little to make note of other than sweaty berry flavors, tartness and bramble.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little more herbal, stalky and tomato-influenced than the riper, fresher 2005, but still an elegant, complex wine that shines a positive light on this little-known region at the base of the Pyrenees. Tobacco, tomato leaf, root beer and bouillon flavors set up an herbal, almost Bordeaux-like finish. Layered and structured to boot. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Full and dark, with aromas of bacon, crusty minerality, black fruits and spice. Balanced yet bullish, with integrated tannins and toasty, coffee-infused flavors that go straight to black. Long and showing additional coffee on the finish. Drinkable now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Aromas of leather, smoked meats, charred oak and lacquer are not for the weak, while the mouthfeel is firm, deep and just right. Juicy and bright in terms of flavors, with black cherry, vanilla and coconut. Toasty and alert on the finish, but with smacking tannins. Drinkable now and good for another four or five years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Broad-shouldered and muscled-up, this hearty wine seems more youthful than it is. The nose is spicy and full of lively berry aromas, while the palate is laced with red cherry, raspberry and vanilla. It's a classic gran reserva with dried qualities and spice. It's right on the money.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bramble, cherry cola and snappy red berry aromas announce this as a secure, snappy wine. The flavor profile is round, genial and nicely balanced between plum and berry and vanilla/mocha notes. Like most Sierra Cantabria reds, this touches all the bases and should elicit a smile of satisfaction.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly more leafy, herbal and burnt on the nose than ideal, but there's also tobacco, cherry and earth notes to keep it proper. The palate is smooth in feel, with good depth, while the flavor profile has a salty side as well as black cherry and molasses. Good wine with a few issues.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raisiny, sweet and baked, with plenty of oak coming on as it airs out. This vintage is somewhat syrupy and strained compared to prior years, with baked black fruit flavors. Seems a little reduced on the finish, but overall it's still good given this winery's strong track record and how the wine compares to other 2007 Riojas.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Solid, big and fruity, which is basically what a Campo de Borja Garnacha should be. Sweet red fruits and robust kick define the palate, which is tannic but not obtrusively so. Zesty and a bit of a one-noter, but a nice one. Garnacha with 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dry, dusty and minty on the nose, with cherry, cedar and sweet oak notes. The palate has a hard, clangy bite to it, while the flavors run toward herbal cherry and dried tobacco. Some vanilla and cola along the way bring up the pleasure quotient. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Opens with peach and apple aromas that are 100% normal, while the palate has a chiseled clarity to it that's crisp and appreciated. A flavor profile of dry apple, citrus and dusty spice is good, and the finish is fresh and lemony. Drink right away.",Spain,Albariño
"A solid, earthy style of Navarran red wine, with plum, berry and meaty aromas. The palate is forward, with solid flavors of tobacco, plum, tomato and leather. More fruity than herbal, with heat, thyme, mocha and coffee on the finish. Tastes like something from the Old World. Not currently imported.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dried fruit, a touch of compost and then bold coffee and mocha aromas give the wine a decent nose, and the palate, while zesty and snappy, is endowed with pretty good raspberry, cherry and strawberry flavors. Overall it's fruity and ready to drink but fairly ordinary, and while we like the wine we can't say it's a knockout.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This wine is a “product” in every sense of the word. It's consistent from year to year, and if you know Esmeralda, with its sweet blend of Moscatel and Gewürz, then you know that it delivers simple but pleasant lime, kiwi and cantaloupe flavors with a certain watery freshness.",Spain,Moscatel
"While we'd suggest waiting for the 2007 to hit the market, this softer-styled wine is showing mature melon, tropical fruit and bee's wax aromas in front of mild citrus, lemon and pineapple flavors. It has a medium-weight body and almost a honeyed roundness. Drink now.",Spain,Verdejo
"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best.",Spain,White Blend
"Matchstick, mushroom and licorice nib aromas add character to this fading but textured wine that struggles to offer peach and nectarine flavors. Expect additional softness with each passing month, and along the way you should only hope to salvage some citrus, white chocolate and melon notes.",Spain,Garnacha
"Dry black cherry and berry fruit shows some early chemical accents, and the wine stays sort of thin and hard all the way to the end. It's peppery and tight, with a simple dark-fruit personality. A little awkward at 14.5%.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Very dark and oaky, with lemon, bacon, charcoal and high-toned black fruit aromas. The palate is rich and warm, almost heavy, with intense blackberry, chocolate and figgy flavors. Shows very nice texture and size but also tips toward molten ripeness and heavy sweetness. Drink soon.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A well-made and refreshing wine for the price. The nose is crisp and smells of nettles, grapefruit, cilantro and stony minerals, while the feel is zesty and the flavors bring a mix of green fruits, citrus and tropicality. Stays on point from start to finish. A fine wine for summer sipping.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dark mineral, toasted French oak and black fruit carry the nose. This is a sturdy, nicely made high-end Rioja, but due to the heat of the year its range of flavors is narrow as it settles on baked plum and molasses. Medium long on the finish, with a lasting taste of chocolate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fairly generous for a bargain-priced, everyday Rioja. There's bacon, rubber, leather and mild oak on the fruity bouquet, while the palate is concentrated, jumpy and hosts honest red berry fruit flavors along with dry oak and a spot of vanilla. Meets any reasonable expectation of what $12 Rioja should be.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice for a standard, no-frills type of Rioja. The cherry and raspberry aromas are sweet and clean, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of ripe cherry, berry, vanilla and cream. Offers good clarity, power and depth given its price point.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Slightly dry and leafy on the nose, but with beef jerky, cola and mild raisin aromas. The palate is forward, with controlled heat and tannin along with cola, berry and mushroom flavors. Honest in a traditional way, with a long finish that shows a touch of sweet brown sugar. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Gets going with earthy, lightly leathery aromas of red fruits, and that bouquet is backed by lively raspberry, plum and fresh-tomato flavors. It's not narrow, but it's hardly broad either. Finishes with a lively herbal note.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Look for the wine wrapped in banana-yellow paper, and you'll likely be surprised and pleased by its ripe, clean aromas and easygoing plum and cherry flavors. It's medium-bodied and nice on the palate, with a smooth, nonprobing finish. It's 75% Garnacha and 25% Tempranillo done well.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark, balsamic aromas blend with hints of wood, bramble and briar to give this wine rusticity, while the palate is slick and medium in weight, with black-fruit and tea-like flavors. It's a little narrow on the finish, but there's also a creamy, oak-driven vanilla flavor that softens things up. A good wine that's 70% Tempranillo and 30% Garnacha.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A bit too much new American oak was thrown at this crianza, leaving minty, drying aromas that veer into the butter and dill range. The palate is largely fresh and balanced, with peppery red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry. A woody encore smothers the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cloudy in color, with tart rhubarb aromas. The palate shows some acidity and tang, with pink grapefruit flavors offering a shrill kick. But overall the wine has seen better days and has become limited in scope at this point.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fiery, hot aromas feature raspberry, burnt leaves, balsamic notes and earth. It's wild and jumpy in the mouth, with rhubarb and cranberry defining the tight, underdeveloped palate, while the finish is tangy and almost peachy. Shows many cool-year characteristics of a 2002.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fresh peach and nectarine dominate the nose on this semisweet blend of Viura and Malvasia. The flavors are mostly melon and citrus, while the finishing touch is that of fruit cocktail. It's a touch sticky in the long run, but at least it isn't cloying or cooked.",Spain,White Blend
"Aromatic notes of talcum powder and scented candles give this Bordeaux blend from Navarra a light, pleasant bouquet. But the palate is more starching and hard than ideal, leaving a spiky, jagged feel to the wine's raspberry and plum fruit. So rugged and jarring that food is downright mandatory. Ripped but punishing.",Spain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Rueda is best when it's fresh and dancing, but this 2006 is showing too many signs of the hot year from which it came. It's already tired and soft, with compost and mealy citrus aromas going head to head with grapefruit and marmalade notes. Tasted in December 2007, this was probably a tastier, fresher wine six months prior.",Spain,Verdejo
"Stylish and alluring nose; quite sexy. The malolactic fermentation took place in barrel, so the wine has mouthfeel and richness. Yet it's a juicy, friendly, fruit-forward style of Tempranillo, one that finishes with mocha and wood-driven spice notes. 20,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Earthy and fully ripe, with classic Rioja aromas of sweet leather, herbs and a touch of raisin. But once you get it onto the palate you'll be impressed with the roundness of the body and the depth of the cola, cherry and plum flavors. Finishes with cocoa, buttered toast and width. Drink now through 2008.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nice on the bouquet, with aromas of licorice, tobacco, earth, mineral and solid berry fruit. The palate is a blend of power and smooth tannins, and the flavors of black fruit tilt toward fleshy, with buttery oak as an accent. A little flat on the finish, with herbal notes, toast and fig spread. Ready to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Initiates with savory, mildly soupy aromas on top of berry fruit. The palate is plump, ripe and balanced, with mocha, coffee and dark, meaty berry flavors. Toasty, dry and very solid on the finish, and convincingly rich as a whole.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Miserere offers most of what you'd expect from a high-end Priorat red. The nose features mineral, grilled meat, raisin, berry, cherry and even a citrusy accent. The palate has a full, complete feel and warm flavors of black cherry, licorice and raisin. Very nice but one step short of excellence. Drink now through 2012.",Spain,Red Blend
"Toasty, earthy, chocolaty and meaty, but not overly fruity or sweet. The palate features solid structure and body, with rooty raspberry, plum, nutmeg and other spice-based flavors. A little rough and short on the finish, with firm tannins. Gets better the longer it sits, so decant or let breathe before pouring.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Baked, roasted and earthy, with a deep palate of plum, berry and spice aromas. We wouldn't label this a complex or complicated wine; what you smell and taste initially is more or less what you get. Spicy and chocolaty on the finish, and satisfying.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Having not seen the Valsacro wines for several years, it's nice to know that they are up to good things. This is a dark wine dominated by aromas of cassis liqueur and earth. It's lively and structured, with layers of toasted berry, chocolate and black pepper flavors. Shows a lot of shadings and trimmings, including creamy oak on the finish. Drink now and over the next two years.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromas of mineral and jammy raspberry are attractive, yet the palate seems a bit metallic and clicky, with hard to penetrate flavors of rooty fruits, vanilla, coconut and cola. Opens with airing to display secondary berry fruit flavors in front of a tough, firm finish. Nice and ripe, and ready to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"Solid as a rock, with earthy berry and mild herbal aromas. The palate is firm and a touch angular, with sweet raisin, blackberry, candy and chocolate flavors. Long and steady on the finish, with a nice mix of freshness and richness that serves it well. Drink now through 2013.",Spain,Red Blend
"Opens with unique, abnormal aromas of spiced fruit, cardamom and nutmeg. The palate is thick along the edges but lacks body in the middle, while flavors of red berry fruit are chunky, mildly stewy and roasted. Earthy and funky wine, but with good feel and overall good character.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not even El Bosque could escape the difficulties of the cool, extended 2007 vintage. While typically dark and bulky on the nose, it's also dull by Bosque standards, with oaky mocha and coffee stepping in as filler. The body is drawn and tannic, with oak, resin and dark berry flavors. Finishes resiny as well. By no means bad, but given Bosque's precedent it's not stellar.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Put this Spanish rosado in the summer rotation. The nose gives you raspberry and strawberry aromas in light, airy form but avoids the candied side of the rosé spectrum. Pink grapefruit and nectarine flavors give it a fresh, clean, Mediterranean style.",Spain,Rosé
"Take the bubbles out of Cava and this is pretty much what's left. The nose is light, with peach and banana aromas. Tangy flavors of orange and pineapple are lively but lacking, and the finish is ripe but simple. For flush flavors and just enough zap, this is good.",Spain,White Blend
"Oily and citrusy, with pungent, almost nutty aromas that are at once exotic but simultaneously funky and sour. The palate hits with chopping passion fruit and citrus, but there's also some banana to contemplate. In the end, it's just too hard to embrace and go beyond a sip or two, which isn't a great testimonial.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Sweet and chunky, like Hawaiian Punch. This is heavy and unctuous at this stage of evolution, with raspberry and ripe melon flavors. Round and no longer edgy. Wait for the 2007.",Spain,Grenache
"An oaky, awkward, lactic lug that offers a ton of wood grain, funky fruit and a hard, overly spicy mouthfeel. It's trying to do too much with smoke and mirrors; the raw material isn't there.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Blackberry and cola are the prime aromas that comprise the alluring bouquet. And as you'd expect, there's also leather and spicy wood thrown in. In the mouth, it's an intense ride of rich black cherry and plum. For now it's a little closed on the finish; will likely be better in three years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"For an old wine from a weak vintage, this has its positives. For starters, the nose offers a nice mix of dried fruit, tobacco, cedar and fig paste, while the palate is properly acidic and tastes of red plum, raspberry and oak-driven vanilla. At its drinking peak now; with preserved juiciness and lots of kick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nothing over the top but well made and clean, with red fruit aromas that don't overpower. Flavors of peppy plum and berry flavors come across bright and zesty. A comfortable everyday red with with good follow-through and no off aromas, flavors or textures.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rooty smelling, with cola, sarsparilla, spiced meats and leafy berry aromas. The palate is plump and soft but healthy, with round, sweet berry fruit flavors and ample spice. A generous wine that's hefty, broad and ready to drink. Impressive given that its run is 45,000 cases.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An immense, heavily concentrated and sweet wine with aromas of bacon, wood smoke, citrus peel and jammy berry. The palate is rich and unctuous, so much so that it might qualify as syrupy in some circles. The flavors run toward roasted berries, fig paste and chocolate, and all totaled it's bold but a little overripe. Drink now.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Some patience is required to plow through the early aromas of cherry cough drops, bitter chocolate and smoke, but once you make it past that the wine turns decidedly red and fresh. The palate has tang and a citrusy quality, while flavors of zesty red fruits hint at lemon and pie cherry. A high-toned wine that's ready to drink now and over the next five years with lamb or beef.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of apple, fresh hay, pineapple and natural vanilla draw you in, while the palate is lively and fresh, with citrus, pineapple and pithy lemon flavors. Juicy, clean and zesty on the finish, and chiseled in terms of structure and acidity. Very nice Albariño for the price.",Spain,Albariño
"Black as night, with chunky, sweet, candied aromas as well as notes of bacon, shoe polish and cough medicine. This is a classic modern-styled wine with intense roasted berry, herb and exotic spice flavors. Licorine, prune, coffee and oak emerge on the broad finish. Very ripe yet it does a good job of straddling the line between big and overripe.",Spain,Red Blend
"Starts out sort of jumbled, with heavy aromas, deep fruit scents and a shot of leather or animal hide. The palate is healthy, however, with proper acidity pushing earthy plum and berry flavors. Shows good structure and ample size and mouthfeel. The blend is 75% Garnacha and 25% Graciano.",Spain,Red Blend
"Quite brambly and funky, with a roasted “country” quality that points it toward leather and rubber. An organic wine with 80% Tempranillo and 20% Garnacha; it's sort of tangy and choppy on the palate, with a mix of awkwardly sweet and sour flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"Concentrated aromas of mocha, toffee and burnt coffee bound from the glass, followed by flavors of sour red cherry and berry. Sound balance and soft, dusty tannins make this wine easily enjoyable and easy to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"So young and simple that one can only describe this as Albariño Nouveau. It's a bouncy, almost spritzy confection with pineapple, green apple and other thin citrus flavors. There's zero body to it, but it is fresh and snappy.",Spain,Albariño
"For a good price you get a lot of white wine here. Muga barrel ferments this Viura, so there's popcorn and richness to the nose, but it's not overwhelming. And in the mouth, the lemon, orange and tangerine flavors are flat-out lovely. Pour a glass of this with your next platter of sizzling garlic shrimp and you'll be in heaven.",Spain,Viura
"Good color and intriguing aromas of baked fruit, tobacco and mint indicate that you're getting some modern-styled ripeness along with traditional Rioja earth, spice and old man's library. The palate is juicy and mildy fruity, while the finish pushes chocolate, vanilla, baking spice and tannins. Drinkable now but will age for another five years without a problem.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ysios is one of the most visually pleasing wineries you'll see. It was designed by Santiago Calatrava and it's the town of Laguardia's modern stamp. But until now the wines were just average. This one, however, is far better than that, with pure dried cherry and raspberry flavors bolstered by spicy oak, vanilla and perfect acidity. Drink now–2009. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smooth berries and plenty of dark licorice carry the seductive bouquet. And seeing that this is Remelluri's signature high-priced red, you should expect the fine berry, plum and chocolate flavors that rest comfortably on the palate. But like many '02s, the wine has a hard mouthfeel and pronounced acidity, so it doesn't quite trigger all the pleasure points that it might in a better vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bramble bush, graphite, leather and medium-depth fruit are the opening notes on this qualm-free, fairly muscular Rioja. Dark cherry and raspberry flavors run the palate, and they are followed by a warm, milk chocolate-tinged finish. Very nice for a 2002.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Two vintages running this is good, even-flowing rosé. The color is on the red side, but the nose dials in on fluffy red-berry aromas. Plum is the primary fruit flavor, and there's body and a flame of heat and spice to the finish. A good food wine to drink now.",Spain,Rosé
"Light cherry and raspberry aromas take it to a level above neutral, while the palate is just as clean and light, with apricot, peach and strawberry flavors. With some tang and good acidity, it shows freshness and persistence.",Spain,Garnacha
"Initially it smells a bit cheesy and drawn, but with time it evolves to show plum, raspberry and tire rubber aromas. In the mouth, it's tight, fresh and a little gritty, with red-fruit flavors of cherry and raspberry. Not overly generous in terms of mouthfeel, but it does push the fruit until the final bell. More of a food wine than a solo sipper.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Opens with marshmallow-like sweetness on the nose, but that changes to lean fruit and saline with time. The palate is solid and zesty, with standard Rioja-style plum, berry and dill flavors. It's a fresh but quiet wine, with a tight body, medium tannins and pretty good flavors. Well done but nothing unusual.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Ochoa usually puts out a good rosado made from Garnacha, and this vintage keeps the winery's reputation intact. It starts with fresh peachy aromas and then comes on with light berry and peach flavors. Arguably a bit candied, but perfectly good for summer quaffing.",Spain,Garnacha
"Light aromas of melon, apple and pear are just fine, and the mildly chunky palate sporting apple-based flavors is good, as is the pineapple finish. Tasty and simple Albariño, and really not much more to say. Good for the summer into fall.",Spain,Albariño
"Waxy and burning on the nose, and then very heavy and sugary on the palate. The orange marmalade and honey flavors are over the top and sticky, while the wine leaves an unctuous, resinous finish. Too much of this 15% Moscatel could cause a headache.",Spain,Moscatel
"With 20% Garnacha, this Navarran Merlot carries a green and lactic streak that makes it a tough go. The palate is gigantic and oversaturated, which makes the whole clumsy and rough.",Spain,Merlot
"Black cherry and toasty oak aromas greet you, followed by racy raspberry flavors. There's a lot of acid, but there's also ample berry flesh and texture to handle it. Shows good quality overall but also some of 2002's lean character. Drink now with food and it won't be any trouble.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Raw and resiny, with no peg for you to hang your hat on. The palate is sharp and short on ripeness, while the finish settles on hot. Just an aggressive wine with little polish. Not worth the price.",Spain,Merlot
"Green, lemony and murky on the nose, this young wine shows that a good vintage in a renowned region doesn't always amount to a good wine. This is a funky, earthy specimen with burnt notes and a grassy aftertaste.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Tired and waxy, with canned fruit aromas and almost no measurable freshness. Tastes both sweet and vegetal. May have been better upon release but now it's flat.",Spain,Albariño
"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",Spain,Albariño
"A little bit leafy and light, but that's traditional Rioja for you. The color is a mix of orange and red, while the palate of snappy red fruits is beginning to slip toward peach and nectarine. If you like a leaner, racier style of wine, then drink this now. It's probably at its peak.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fans of big, blocky reds that offer punch, extract and tannins should jump on this now, and then watch it age nicely for the next four or five years. That's the type of meaty, tannic, fruit-infused Tempranillo this is. It's always going to be short and stocky, but still it will round into shape as it matures.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Early leather and animal aromas soon yield to brighter fruit scents, and that's followed up by a palate detailed by cherry and plum flavors. This nice, comfortable wine offers freshness and texture; it's a very good crianza that nails the relationship between fruit and oak.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A heavier, more elevated style, but still well-priced relative to the competition. Expect lusty toast and berry aromas along with a round but juicy palate that delivers chewy berry and plum flavors and some “grasa,” which means fat in Spanish. A cut above most wines in this price range.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Bouquet is nice and smooth, with an earthy warmth surrounding scents of purple flowers and crushed berries. The palate is lively and acidic, with semisweet red-fruit flavors that are more generic. No reticence here; the wine is racy to the end as it finishes with oak and vanilla.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Alert and snappy on the nose, with no “hot” or stewy characteristics from the steamy year. Raspberry and cassis flavors are supported by tight, crisp oak, while the finish offers mineral, coffee and cherry essence. A solid wine from a hellishly warm vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stout and generally quite pure, with aromas of leather and berries that thicken and gather density with airing. The palate is your standard new-age blend of dark cherry and raspberry, while the finish is oaky, warm and spicy. Very nice, if a touch jammy and simple.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Plenty of dusty, spicy aromas run the nose, almost to the exclusion of ripe fruit. But once it opens the wine displays savory flavors as well as some pure dark berry. On the finish, it's a touch lean and crisp, but overall this is a balanced Rioja reserva with spunk.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little leafy, a little spicy and a little bit of a throwback to the days when Rioja wasn't taken so seriously. This has light cinnamon oak shadings followed by cola, tobacco and sweet berry flavors. Somewhat acidic and sheer, so better with food; drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A juicy, prickly wine with pungent red-fruit aromas backed by tangy cherry, raspberry and currant flavors. It's firm and tight, entirely reflective of the cool vintage, and the bet here is that it's unlikely to ever lose that inherent toughness. Needs food to absorb the crispness. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Austere, foresty aromas of pine and juniper lead to a snappy, mildly scratchy palate that's acidic and racy. Amid the scour there's vivacious red plum and pie cherry flavors, and then a finish that's tight but controlled. An old-school wine that's fresh and linear.",Spain,Garnacha
"This is a tight, red-fruit dominated style of Granache. It's generic and crisp on the nose, with tart, linear raspberry and red cherry flavors and a dry, peppery finish. Focused and angular, with a foresty, spicy undercurrent. Drink now.",Spain,Garnacha
"Tilts a bit toward the ripe side, with sweet, mature aromas of blueberry, raisin and vanilla. It's fleshy and soft in terms of feel, with earthy, warm flavors of fig, berry and molasses. Drink now for its traditional integrity and tobacco-like qualities; it's not improving.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A little tight and reticent, but airing reveals aromas of raisin, marzipan and earth. The palate is measurably peppier, with lean but healthy red-fruit flavors stepping up and demanding to be noticed. As for feel, expect grabby tannins and shortness. Probably at its best now but will hold steady for at least five more years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Seductive and classy aromas of sandalwood, cola, spice, licorice and leather amount to pretty much everything you could ask for. Ripe and complex in terms of its earth and tree-fruit flavors. Finishes svelte and sturdy, but with ample vanilla, toffee and tobacco nuances. Classic gran reserva. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Top-notch manzanilla, plain and simple. What's not plain and simple is the fact that this is so pure and smooth that it dances across your palate. From the vanilla and almond on the nose to the pastry and mushroom on the palate to the creamed butter on the finish, this is as good as it gets in this class.",Spain,Sherry
"Herbal aromas come with bell pepper and berry fruit notes, while the palate is solid in terms of feel but shows classic Navarran flavors of jalapeño and green pepper. Good texture and mouthfeel, but probably too green for a lot of people. Tempranillo with Merlot and Cabernet is the blend.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Plenty of red berry and jam greet you on the nose, and beyond that there's sweet barrel notes and a little wood smoke. It's smart and snappy on the palate, but not all that long or complex. Finishing notes of tobacco add interest. Tasty and ready to go now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A good effort in a tough year, and frankly we're happy that Muga decided to make a reserva in 2002. The wine shows lean aromas of dried red fruit, tomato leaf and dill. In fact, dill is a recurring theme from front to back. And along the way there's acids, red cherries, plums and currants. Good but leaner than a normal Muga effort.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Early aromas of leather, rubber and char sort of shadow the fruit component. But in the mouth there's ample blackberry, cherry and pepper, all of which bring the wine into form. In terms of mouthfeel, it's good. And on the finish it's got some of that espresso bitterness that sings of toasted barrels.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Healthy in look, with tobacco, dried spices and pure wood notes on the nose. The palate is drizzled with plum and berry flavors, but there's also ample tobacco and tomato-leaf accents. Overall this aging Rioja is healthy and has enough of the nuances and subtleties to make the grade.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A real surprise! Who in their right mind could expect so much quality from a Cab Franc-Tempranillo blend from Penedès? But try it and we guarantee you're going to like it. The nose is meaty, ripe and round, while the palate features pure core fruit backed by chocolaty warmth. With kick as well as subtlety, this is a bargain hunter's dream. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Still young and jumpy, but the ripeness and pedigree of this Penedès bruiser is beyond reproach. It's big, bold and deep as a mountain lake, with black plum, bullion and a pile of blackberry on the palate. Tons of extract and tannins make this inky, saturated heavyweight a wine to ponder. For fans of forward, beefy reds. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Spain,Red Blend
"Super pricey but this is a knock-your-socks-off wine with a gorgeous bouquet that shows not even a hint of syrup or jam. The palate is like a nova; it bursts with plum, blackberry and cinnamon. No harshness, not too tannic, and splendid on the finish, where toast and chocolate appear and stick around for a long time. It's 80% old-vines Garnacha and 20% Cabernet, and there just aren't enough superlatives to describe it. Only 300 cases made. Imported by Rare Wine Company.",Spain,Red Blend
"The 2002 is the current vintage (reviewed in June), but this wine is superior and is just now entering its prime; call it red nectar with a cement foundation. Mogador offers the purest Priorat fruit going, and the '01 is ethereal, with chewy blackberry, chocolate and vanilla flavors along with horsehide, black pepper and tobacco on the finish. Imported by Europvin/Michael Skurnick Wines.",Spain,Red Blend
"This reserve-level P.X. sets the gold standard for excellence in sweet sherry. The lovely bouquet straddles the line between unadulterated sweetness and impeccable slyness. The flavors of fig, chocolate, caramel, browned butter and cinnamon are amazing. So chewy and thick, but balanced by firm acids. Brilliant.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Round and lush, with immense fruit from the nose to the palate. Beautifully balanced, with sweet plum and berry flavors, a lash of smoke and a touch of pepper and thyme. There's nothing raw or earthy about this wine; it's opulent and pure, a testament to vineyard management and great winemaking in a tough year. Doesn't even need much cellar time; drink from 2006–09. Imported by Rare Wine Company.",Spain,Red Blend
"A beauty that represents Priorat in its most complete form. Meaty and savage at first, Cims is a terroir wine of the first order. Still, it's polished, with a soft, smooth texture and impressive cherry, cola, spice and vanilla flavors. Coffee and mocha on the finish seal the deal. Made by Sara Pérez of Mas Martinet. Imported by Multiple Importers.",Spain,Red Blend
"From Daphne Glorian, among the region's original new wavers, Clos Erasmus is simply one of the best, most typical Priorat wines out there. And while the '02 may not rank as a classic, it's still superb. Aromas of graphite, mineral and licorice dominate, backed by layered cherry, plum and earth notes. From four small vineyards around the town of Gratallops. About 450 cases made. Imported by European Cellars.",Spain,Grenache
"Clearly more serious than average, with light apple and honey aromas that are followed nicely by lime, apple and white-pepper flavors. Rather round, with freshness and a solid mouthfeel. For cava this is fairly classy and elevated. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Sweet and sour aromas amount to a prickly bouquet, while the palate has some flesh as well as freshness. Nectarine and spiced apple flavors are solid but pithy, and overall the wine is good but lacks concentration. Good for everyday quaffing.",Spain,Rosé
"The opening of earth, berry and leather aromas is solid enough, yet the palate is quite acidic, yielding semitart but exact flavors of pie cherry and plum. The finish is tight, with light oak touches. But overall it's on the angular side, with a bit of the razor's edge in terms of acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Cherry and dried cranberry aromas along with the magenta color give this wine a “red” personality, which is confirmed by the crisp red-fruit flavor profile. Fairly light in weight, but juicy and fresh, with cleansing acidity and some sharpness.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Smooth up front, with a light veil of oak sitting on top of black fruit. In the mouth, flavors of raspberry and plum satisfy in a juicy, medium-depth sort of way, while the finish is cushioned by chocolate and vanilla notes. A crianza that gets it right.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Color and size are readily apparent but gaps appear between the layers. For starters, the nose doesn't have the purity and density that it could; and the palate also shows some weakness where structure and quality of fruit meet. Otherwise, it's a ripe and modern red wine with some lushness and depth.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Round, clean and a touch leathery, but not penetrating or dense. For a nice, smooth red wine with some plum and cinnamon spice, look no further. This crianza is easygoing, lightly oaked and good throughout.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Alluring cherry and berry aromas show a touch of candied sweetness, yet overall the bouquet is magnetically attractive. And the palate is deep and spicy, with tons of red fruit accented by toast and chocolate. And as far as complexity notes go, there's rose petal, lavender and leather. Eminently drinkable; excellent quality to price ratio. Imported by Allied Domecq Wines USA.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A touch of early aromatic raisin gives way to spice, tobacco, tomato and cherry, while the palate is ripe and rich, with flavors of raspberry syrup and prune. Very deep and smooth, with just enough toasty oak to keep things well framed. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Red Blend
"It's rare that a sweet sherry reaches such heights, but here's a case in point. Iberia has impeccable prune and raisin aromas along with intoxicating scents of toffee and cane sugar. All in all, the bouquet is excellent. The palate, meanwhile, is seamless as it deals raisin, vanilla and mocha. Spot on for a dessert elixir, with a ceaseless finish.",Spain,Sherry
"Nutty and intense, like peanut brittle reduced to liquid form—but with less than half the corn syrup. It delivers beautiful texture and intensity; it's almost fruity, but then mushroom, almond and macadamia nut take over. With perfect weight and a finish that doesn't quit, this is a great dry Sherry. Imported by Shaw-Ross International Importers.",Spain,Sherry
"Elevated from the first nosing through the multilevel palate and then out the door. Fragrant like an aromatic magnet, with red licorice, wild flower and jammy fruit. A potent brew, with some medicinal cherry to the toasty finish. Super healthy, with an aggressive personality. Could use a year or two to settle because now it's rather tannic. Imported by Europvin.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pure and nutty, with aromas of dried apricot and sea air. In the mouth you get lots of almond and butter, while the A-rate finish is buttery but also quite complex. A classic, refined wine that dances across your tongue like a ballerina. Imported by Shaw-Ross International Importers.",Spain,Sherry
"Sassy and forward, with ripe aromas and exotic flavors. This wine registers at 16% but it's not fortified, so it comes across more like a sweet but dry wine than, say, Port. Expressive and rich, with cherry cough drop, dark chocolate and raisin flavors. At one moment it's table wine, the next an elixir. And the finish won't quit. Perfect with cheese. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Initial aromas are squarely in the bell pepper/jalapeño mode, and later moss and earth enter the picture. The palate is basic, a bit acidic, and saucy, with herbal red-fruit flavors and a finish of tomato and basil. Struggles a little, but solid in a “country” sort of way. The blend is Tempranillo, Garnacha, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Tan in color and smelling fairly oxidized. Aromas of peach pits and blanched almond lack freshness, while the palate veers more toward applesauce than fresh fruit. There's some life left but not enough to make it a recommended wine. Tastes, feels and smells sort of jumbled.",Spain,Albariño
"Chunky spiced apple and saline aromas get the wine off on so-so footing, and the apple and grapefruit flavors come with weight. Citrus takes over on the finish, but it's kind of pithy. Doesn't seem as fresh as it should be for a brand new '08.",Spain,Albariño
"A nominally sweet red-candy note helps define the upbeat nose, and it all makes sense once you know that there's 20% Garnacha in the wine along with 75% Tempranillo and Mazuelo. With airing you get nice pie cherry and raspberry flavors, while the mouthfeel is juicy and correct. A good wine for pizza or hamburgers. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ready as it will ever be, this mildly baked red starts with minty aromas and chocolate. The palate is saturated and full of fruit, but the feel is a touch thin given the color and the lightly cooked aromas. Drink now with food and it will satisfy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite yellow, with toffee, peanuts and light fruit aromas. Big and round in the mouth, with dried apple, almond and white pepper flavors. Full and long late, with tons of texture and a strong mushroom accent. Powerful, so you'd better be a fino fan if you're going to tackle this one.",Spain,Sherry
"The definition of old-vines Priorato can be found within this bottle. The Garnacha is very old, the Cariñena even older, and some mature Cabernet Sauvignon adds spine. On the nose, there's a lot of barrique. The palate is snappy, almost acidic, and thus the flavors run toward pie cherry and raspberry. Classic in style; an Old World throwback. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Big and ripe, with tobacco, blackberry and fresh-cut lumber on the nose. This big boy weighs in at 15%, so the chocolate, cassis and rich blackberry flavors on the palate should not come as a surprise. Toasty and plush; a model New World red from Jacques and François Lurton and partner Michel Rolland. Imported by Monsieur Touton Selection Ltd.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Ethereal and sort of reminiscent of a fine Port, or maybe Banyuls. Pure and ripe on the nose, with licorice, violet and wild blackberry aromas. This is a smooth-drinking wine that's showing some maturity; meaning the tannins are smooth and the acids not too pointed. A real mouthful, with a measure or two of depth. Finishes big. Imported by Winebow.",Spain,Red Blend
"Intense and colorful; one of the most flavorful and sizable versions of Terrasses on record. Flavors of boysenberry, blackberry and plum sizzle, while the layered palate spreads out nicely upon airing. Everything about this Cariñena-dominated wine is solid and precise. A really nice taste of Priorat at a fairly affordable price. Imported by Rare Wine Company.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pure and cerebral, but with enough natural liveliness that you can't help but love it. Aromas of schist, lavender and plum mix with oak-driven bacon and chocolate to create a welcoming whole. Sizable cherry and plum flavors are round but also precise and firm. Looming tannins suggest some cellaring may be warranted. The blend is Garnacha followed by Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. Imported by Vinum International.",Spain,Red Blend
"This monster is intensely mineral, with aromas of crushed stones mixed with leather, lavender, pepper and cherry. In the mouth, it's heady with maple, leather, asphalt and cola. Comes at you in layers, the last of which is a finishing flow of espresso. Aged 20 months in new 500-liter barrels, not barriques. Imported by Europvin/Michael Skurnick Wines.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark violet in color, with plenty of wood smoke and earth to the nose, which also offers tobacco and mushroom. Dynamic on the palate, with ripe cherry and blackberry flavors. Sort of airy on the finish, with mocha and chocolate. Hefty throughout, with nice tannins. From Marqués de Riscal. Imported by Shaw-Ross International Importers.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Like a freight train, this wine from the village of Poboleda hits with force. From Joan Doix and his winemaking nephew, Ramón Llagostera, it deftly delivers both red and black fruit notes, all on a lightly tannic frame. To call it lip-smacking and juicy would be correct. The blend is 51% old-vines Garnacha, 46% Cariñena and 3% Merlot. 500 cases made. Imported by European Cellars.",Spain,Red Blend
"Ripe and rich; it pushes the limit toward raisiny but doesn't cross the boundary. As a result, the sweet bouquet oozes kirsch, licorice and spice. Stays thick on the palate, but not particularly heavy. Flavors of baked black fruit, mocha and espresso impress, with accents of cinnamon and herbs popping through. Complex and out of the ordinary. Imported by De Maison Selections, Inc.",Spain,Red Blend
"Full, tight and entering its prime, this classic Spanish red offers big aromas of leather, blackberry, violets and dried brush. Dense on the palate, with flavors of black olive, tobacco and racy black fruit. Chewy and chocolaty on the finish, with a wash of real-deal tannins. Will age well for at least another five years. Imported by Classical Wines.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Pristine aromas of caramel, orange peel and leather are both powerful and pure. Flavors of toffee, cinnamon, cheddar cheese and raisin are first-rate, while the sum of the parts is brightened and heightened by perfect acidity. A fine Amontillado that should please anyone with a fondness for good Sherry. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Sherry
"Early tobacco and mint aromas quickly yield to mossy black fruit, and in the mouth it's fresh and zesty, with mild green-pepper infused plum and cassis flavors. Quite crisp and lean, with herbal influences showing up at all points. Classic Navarran red wine.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With raisiny, damp aromas and a flat body, we can only label this Marqués de Murrieta high-ender a miss. While not a disaster, you'd expect more from something labeled Gran Reserva Especial, but instead it fails to capture the essence of Rioja and shows heavy cola, blackberry and truffle flavors as well as deep, dull tannins. Overripe to begin with?",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is an easy, sweeter style of Viura that emits aromas of peaches and pears. The palate is lively enough but not exactly zesty, and the flavors run toward pink grapefruit and other citrus fruits; but think sweet, nice fruits—not sour ones. Has all the hallmarks of a good aperitif wine.",Spain,White Blend
"Racy on the nose, with tea, pepper and pine scents along with basic red-fruit aromas. The palate is zingy and fairly trim, with strawberry and raspberry flavors. Finishes fresh and snappy, with a shot of tartness. Drink now. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rock solid, with spice, leather and piercing oak on the nose. Snappy and upright on the palate, with tons of berry fruit and nice smoky shadings. Balanced and nuanced, with vanilla, licorice, toast and spice on the finish. A winner. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Red Blend
"Massive yet proportional, with olive, rubber and ripe black fruit on the manly bouquet. The palate is ponderous but tasty, with a huge dose of syrupy berry and black-plum flavors. Ripe as all get out, with firm tannins. To call it a powerhouse would be taking things lightly. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pure Garnacha, which is anathema in the region. Savory on the nose, with roasted meat and spice notes as much as fruit. Once it hits the palate, however, the plum and berry flavors explode. Turns elegant as it opens, while retaining intensity. Flashy stuff. Imported by European Cellars.",Spain,Garnacha
"Plenty of smoked meat, hard spice and pulsating fruit to the nose, which evolves greatly if given time. If there's anything to take issue with, it's that the wine is almost too much of a straight-shooter: It's a touch racy and acidic, with a single beam of bright flavors off of which it doesn't vary. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/ Fine Estates From Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark in color and extremely nutty. Along the way there are notes of seawater and white plum. The palate is a bit tangy and sharp, with orange peel, almond and butter. Oily and complex on the finish, with a buttery tail and plenty of palate presence.",Spain,Sherry
"A millennium wine that's now in fine form. It's a typical Garnacha-Cariñena blend that runs heavy on Garnacha. The bouquet is strong and evolved, with leather and mineral along with aromas of crushed flower petals, asphalt and earth. Excellent fruit quality in the mouth; vivid with raspberry and black pepper. 800 cases made. Imported by multiple importers.",Spain,Red Blend
"Immediately this white Garnacha registers as something totally different, but more importantly, it's really good. A mere 108 vines yield this lovely anomaly, almost all of which is imported into the U.S. Look for melon and apricot aromas and flavors, along with accents ranging from almond to peach pit to bee's wax. Spectacular texture. 375 cases made. Imported by European Cellars.",Spain,Garnacha
"All it takes is a quick sniff and it's clear that this is the real thing. Aromas of sweet black cherry, marzipan and dried earth create a classic bouquet. Additional pure cherry on the palate with chocolate; together they strike the right chord. Harmonious and still worthy of some more aging. Imported by Shaw-Ross International Importers.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Light cherry and mild sulfuric aromas are standard fare for this class of wine, while the palate is snappy and fresh, with sweet-and-sour cherry and strawberry flavors. Finishes a little gritty and candied, but pleasant enough overall.",Spain,Red Blend
"Varietal Graciano is something we frequently see, and very rarely does it bowl us over. This wine has jumpy cherry and lemon peel aromas, and the flavors are tight, a touch sour and run toward cherry and red plum. Fruity for certain, but lacking in charm and mouthfeel.",Spain,Graciano
"Round, big and medicinal, with clumsy, roasted berry fruit aromas. The palate isn't overly charming, and the flavors of tomato paste, cranberry and herbal red fruit are curious. Finishes cleansing and zesty, but with another wave of tomato-based flavors. Shows a lot of cool-climate, mountain influence.",Spain,Red Blend
"Baked berry and raisin aromas raise questions about the wine's overall balance, while the plate is sharp and acidic yet tastes of raisin, prune and dried apricots. Rather grabby on the finish. Think slam dancing when approaching this Tempranillo-Garnacha blend.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Is it (MS) or the wine? This vintage of Cáceres rosé seems o.k., but nothing more than a splash across the palate. Cotton candy aromas and grapefruit and orange flavors are what they are. Not bad so long as it's fresh, but it's hard to locate much charm or individuality.",Spain,Rosé
"A throwback Rioja that sports tobacco, mulch and some true Old-World aromas that make you question the wine's health. But airing breathes life and tilts it toward dried cherries. Finally you discover core power hammered home by hard tannins, sharp acidity and an odd nuttiness. Not a wine for all tastes.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"As always, this gracious white wine made from the Viura grape delivers the goods. In this case, it's pineapple and pear aromas in front of pleasant apple and fresh celery flavors. There's even some honeyed apple to the finish. Light, liquidy and never bad when served properly chilled.",Spain,Viura
"For unafflicted plum and berry character, this young, fresh Rioja has the goods. The sweet berry and cherry palate is at peak drinking condition, and the finish runs longer than expected courtesy of a beam of bright acidity. A wine with Zinfandel-like charm. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Almost orange in color but fairly lively on the nose, where cherry, vanilla, leather and licorice come together. Firm and acidic at its center, with surrounding tobacco, cherry and citrus flavors. Shows some toast and root beer on the finish. Very solid stuff from a good vintage. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dry as a bone, with petrol and green-apple aromas. The palate delivers expected apple and lemon flavors, while the finish is crisp, tangy and a touch tart. Simultaneously acidic and elegant. Classic no-sugar brut nature. Imported by Iberian Wine Importers.",Spain,White Blend
"A bit of roasted corn and hay carry the nose of this semi sweet bubbly. It's round and fruity, with notes of canned pear and hints of sweet spice. Decent acidity and zest ensure that it keeps its balance. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This wine will stick to your ribs, and it'll grab your palate on the way down, leaving quite an impression. Red fruit, leather and toast create a rock-solid, ideal nose. Moderately syrupy and full-bodied, with smooth berry flavors and plenty of vanilla. Finishes long and classy. Imported by Classical Wines.",Spain,Red Blend
"90 Dios Baco Cream Sherry; $20. Sweet and a bit unusual, with aromatic notes of cheddar cheese and barnyard along with more typical toffee and caramel. The palate is confectionary and sturdy, with vanilla, maple and mushroom flavors. Plump and rich on the finish.",Spain,Sherry
"Five grapes comprise this luscious, intense, well-rounded wine that offers jolting aromas of black cherry, violets and mineral. Fairly plump and succulent relative to the field, with moderate tannins amplifying flavors of black plum, berries, chocolate and wood. Already easy to drink and will hit its prime in 2006. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Bingo! An excellent wine from a great vintage, simple as that. Exotic and complex aromas that highlight Middle Eastern spices, a silky palate and integrated tannins, what more could you want? How about a delicious mix of five grapes, incredibly harmonious and food friendly? No surprise it's this good: It's made by the team at Clos Mogador. Imported by multiple importers.",Spain,Red Blend
"Salinic, eggy and simply not that fresh. Maybe it's the wine or maybe it's past its prime, but for Albariño it's not showing much. The palate is soft and flat, with fleshy flavors of muddled apple. And the wine just splats against your palate without delivering any grace or cut.",Spain,Albariño
"Fine aromas that announce balance and completeness draw you in, and right away you will like the cherry, red currant and cassis flavors. But as that fruit sits and the acidity builds, the wine goes racy initially and then almost haywire. By the end it almost falls off toward sour. Best right out of the bottle, and with food.",Spain,Tempranillo
"As per usual, this wine carries a leafiness and peppery quality that runs ahead of its fruit quotient. That doesn't mean it's a poor wine; but it emphasizes dry oak and saucy flavors as opposed to richness and ripeness. Best for Rioja traditionalists and those who might drink it with robust foods.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Aromas of cherry sucking candy, sangria and citrus peel are easy and clean but not what you'd call sophisticated. The palate is forward and basic, with tangy cherry and plum skin flavors. It thickens a bit on the finish but always has a racy personality. Better with food due to grabby tannins and acids.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Seems like Solabal let its reserva-level grapes get a little too soft before picking. The wine has color and potential, but the nose is a little flat and syrupy. The palate delivers ripe dark fruit flavors but also a touch of medicinality. Balance can be fleeting and this wine doesn't have it all the way.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Spicy and exotic, with tight fruit and plenty of tannin in the mouth. There's a lot of juicy blackberry flavors along with full-force acids and verve. Tight as a drum, with some rough edges that should mellow over the next year or so. A wine to watch from a region that's showing its stuff. Imported by Bon Vivant Imports.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Quite ripe, with a touch of stewiness that settles with time and morphs into a pool of ripe cherries, berries and raisins. More soft than hard, with easygoing tannins and a meaty, chunky finish laced with licorice and cured meat. Dense and chewy. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Red Blend
"Lots of bacon, leather and earth coat the nose of this vanguard-style Rioja, but unlike the spectacular 2001, the '02 is not nearly as deep and ethereal. Blame the cool, wet vintage and take solace in the fact that it's still a rich, almost syrupy red with integrated tannins and lushness. What's missing is the wine's patented layering and complexity. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Neutral for the most part, with a touch of toasty wheat and baked apple on the nose. Typical cava petrol invades the palate, but it's overrun by tastier, fresher apple and banana flavors. Exhibits some light toastiness on the finish. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Colorful stuff, like the flesh of a wild King salmon. The nose offers dried cherry, nectarine and some carbon dioxide. Fresh and tangy in the mouth, with pink grapefruit as the primary flavor despite its Pinot Noir DNA. Good enough to sip on a summer day, but not what you'd call elevated. Imported by Classical Wines.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Neutral yet clean, with pineapple and lemon-lime on both the nose and palate. Nothing out of the ordinary here. It's exactly as it has been for years: bubbly, a touch sweet and satisfying. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Smooth and full of apple flavors and aromas. Runs a bit sweet and easy, with pear notes poking through. Finishes mild enough, with lemon-lime and a hint of mineral and toast. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Offers all the requisite almond and dried stone fruits one could ask for. The spicy palate is racy as can be, with flavors of mushroom, almond, sea salt and white pepper. The finish is long and powerful, and overall it is a serious Sherry with no cracks or flaws. Imported by W. J. Deutsch & Sons.",Spain,Sherry
"Fat and dark, with tons of rubber, smoke, licorice and tobacco on the nose. Young and rowdy now, with a texture that's tight as a drum. Still, it exhibits fine cherry, blackberry and flowery characteristics. Comes from a hot zone within Priorat, so it's ripe even in a cool vintage. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",Spain,Red Blend
"Initially it's like a pungent strip of fresh-cut oak laid on a bed of leather, but airing reveals black cherry and blueberry flavors and a couple layers of warmth and style. Very nice weight and balance. A little oaky on the nose, but overall it's more than commendable. Imported by Vinamericas Selections.",Spain,Red Blend
"Smooth and open, with pretty cherry, fudge and maple aromas. Rather zingy and stand-up on the palate, where big, rubbery tannins carry full-sized cherry and plum flavors. Finishes with grab and at least two waves of flavor and power. Drink through 2007. Imported by Vinum International.",Spain,Grenache
"Piercing and pungent, with a bit of alcohol on the nose as well as campfire smoke and citrus zest. Smoky and round on the palate, with big-time nuttiness and plenty of mushroom. A condensed, explosive Sherry that hits hard. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Sherry
"One of the best of the region, with supreme concentration and style. It's mostly Syrah, and the color is piercing purple. On the nose, it's a touch granular and nutty at first, but eventually dark, meaty black fruit emerges. Tons of black cherry and heft on the palate, with a lasting, smoky finish. Reaches that higher level, although not quite as surely as the fabulous 2001. Imported by De Maison Selections, Inc.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark in color, with round, malty aromas that run deep. The palate is a bit sweet as well as a bit sharp; think citrus mixed with caramel. And along with that there's pumpkin pie and allspice. Flavorful and nicely balanced. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Sherry
"An Albariño-dominated middleweight with pure and pleasant aromas of pineapple, citrus and slate. Rich, round and defined, with orange, banana and melon flavors. Very much on the money, with curvy acids as opposed to spiky ones.",Spain,Albariño
"With its gold luster and strong aromas of fresh-cut wood, you know it's fully oaked. To that end, an overriding resiny scent melds with hints of flowers, melon and butterscotch. The palate kicks up applesauce and spice, while the finish is defined by dry oak and white pepper. Full-bodied and deserving of serious food.",Spain,Albariño
"A standard but solid Tempranillo is what you're looking at. The nose pushes red fruit and some American oak aromas like pickle and dill. The feel is fresh and young, but also a little fleshy and substantive. Finishes friendly and smooth.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Perfectly nice, but ultimately basic in its approach. The nose is initally dry and woodsy, with plenty of balsam. Later on, the palate reveals a previously unseen black cherry element, while the finish is crisp and lean. Drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
The kick and acidic foundation of this crianza work in its favor. They balance some of the heavier elements and emphasize the berry core and also the finish. Is it narrow and limited? Yes. But it fits the traditional mold and doesn't disappoint.,Spain,Tempranillo
"Spicy and reedy in an old-fashioned way. This wine represents traditional Riojano winemaking: it's tight, acidic and endowed with racy rhubarb, raspberry and dill flavors. Pretty full and big on the palate, with touches of green herb and spice on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Waxy and sweet on the nose, with aromas of corn and cotton candy. Flavors best described as apple and lemon are weak, and the finishing notes are sour.",Spain,Viura
"Pedestrian yet entirely solid, with nice citrus and apple flavors. A very easy wine to understand, with seltzer and grapefruit on the finish along with a slight twinge of mushroom. Good cava that will go down easy. Imported by Admiral Wine Imports.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Light aromas of petrol and lemon-lime are entirely correct for cava, and the palate pushes fresh fruit in the tangerine and grapefruit realm. Has a bit of heft and zap, with a dry, largely clean finish. Fine on its own; maybe better in a Spanish-style mimosa. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Clean but quiet aromas lead to sweet flavors, predominantly candied peach, cantaloupe and dried apricot. Fairly lively in the mouth, almost to the point of being too bubbly. Overall it tastes good even if it's jumpy. Imported by Iberian Wine Importers.",Spain,White Blend
"The nose deals dill, coconut, vanilla and a lot of plum and berry. Soft but not really, with a lively but plush palate that starts with cranberry and raspberry and then deepens to show chocolate and spice. More of a middleweight, but one packing punch; would be nice with roast lamb, etc. Imported by Vintage Wines Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Dark as night, with smooth, deep aromas of earth, leather and black fruit. It's a blend of four fairly common red grapes, and together they yield pleasant plum, blackberry and other dark-fruit flavors. Sizable and tannic, but impressive for its clarity and simplicity. Imported by De Maison Selections, Inc.",Spain,Red Blend
"Seductively rich, with blackberry and vanilla aromas. Ripe and chewy, with plum, vanilla and subtle spice in the background. Nice doses of licorice and bitter chocolate solidify the finish. Quite meaty and modern, if a bit pricy for a youngster from a hot year. Imported by Haro Imports.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A bit transparent in color, but only by Priorat standards. The nose, however, offers all the crusty, earthy red fruit you'd expect; it leads nicely into a palate of sweet cherry, plum and vanilla. Big enough on the finish, with mouthfeel galore. The full package from the town of La Vilella Alta, and not too tannic. Imported by Winebow.",Spain,Garnacha
"Mature but not even close to expiring, with cola, root beer, tree bark and leather on the bouquet. Fairly acidic, which is why it has so much verve at 10+ years. Flavors of dried cherry, raspberry and citrus peel are classic in their attack. Very good in an Old World way. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Cherry, earth and leather are nice opening notes, while some charred oak adds masculinity and depth. Almost syrupy in the mouth, with plenty of black cherry and chocolate to satisfy those with a sweet tooth. Exhibits nice core qualities. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Red Blend
"Clean, nutty and smooth, if a touch neutral on the nose. The palate pushes more nuts and distant white fruits, followed by a finish of fleur de sel and cashew butter. Slightly heavy but that's the style; like its sister manzanilla, this wine is very consistent year to year.",Spain,Sherry
"Quite international in style, a direct reflection of the Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah components that comprise the wine. That said, this is probably the best wine Martinez Bujanda has made at its La Mancha winery; it's plump and ripe, with nice cherry and plum flavors. It's medium in weight and length, and juicy. Likable as can be. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Red Blend
"Modern in terms of its forward oak, extraction and deep color. The nose is packed with charcoal, tobacco and pepper, while the fresh, forward palate pushes cherry cola and baked fruit. Firm tannins, however, close it down, leaving a clipped finish and the perception of only moderate depth. Decant to get best results.",Spain,Red Blend
"This Bordeaux-style blend features enticing aromas of molasses, licorice, leather and plum, and while the palate satisfies, it doesn't quite live up to the hype built by the bouquet. The feel is soft, as if the edges had slipped away. Still, it offers good mouthfeel and decent depth.",Spain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Aromas of dark fruits are distinct and defined, while hints of perfume soften the bullish, rather earthy nose. Classy berry fruit rests comfortably on the palate, while the feel is juicy and tight. Finishes strong, maybe a little sharp, but with full flavors. 100% Cabernet.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"CUNE is a throwback bodega whose wines won't appeal to followers of the new wave. And since I consider myself a backer of the modern style, I found this wine too obtuse, funky and borderline dirty to rate higher. It's full of mossy, stewy flavors and the feel is heavy. Traditionalist, however, may find it worthy of greater praise.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This wine is not up there with the bodega's top bottlings. It's rather sweet and soft, with mildly green and minty aromas. In the mouth, there's size and power but also a strong medicinal overtone that dampens the fiesta. In the end it's big and fruity but there's no sense of path or purpose.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lemon-lime and ginger ale are the opening aromas, while the palate carries green melon and passion fruit flavors. Not terribly intense or complex, with a cider-like spritz to the mouthfeel and finish.",Spain,Viura
"Vanilla, raisin and carob aromas announce a level of heft and overripeneness that is never lost or compensated for. It's a jammy, soft, well-aged specimen that doesn't have much life or kick. It does offer ripe, sweet berry flavors, however, and some molasses.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Raisin, licorice and sawdust are the primary aromas, while the palate runs dry and slightly overdone with oak. It's a decent wine that's neither funky nor faulty; but it is dried out and lean, with apple skin and hard-spice flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Clean and toasty, with mineral and the slightest hint of mushroom. Full and ripe in the mouth, with toasty apple flavors. Limited in depth and complexity, but full of lemon-lime. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Gets going in heavy, stewy fashion, with aromas of rubber, asphalt and leather. Picks up speed and precision on the palate, where there's a good mix of strident fruit, vanilla and smooth tannins. A lot is on offer here if you give it time to open up and show its true colors. Imported by Vinamericas Selections.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Raisiny and extremely ripe, with licorice on the nose. Prune, chocolate and fig flavors dominate, while the palate runs as viscous as possible without it turning solid. Probably a bit too syrupy, but loaded with flavor.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"From the village of La Morera, this is a jumpy, spiky wine with lively acidity and a racy personality. Aromas of lemon peel, black olive and rock quarry precede a chiseled palate that's quite tannic. Pent-up power for sure, with a blast of toasty vanilla on the finish. Possibly a touch green at its core. Imported by Classical Wines.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"More of an approachable Priorat, with plump fruit and modest tannins. It's a blend of five grapes, mostly from vineyards planted in the 1990s, and the aging takes place in one-year-old French oak. Ripe and rich enough to go with hearty foods, but it's not a full-force bruiser. Look for boysenberry and blackberry flavors, hints of cocoa, and a smooth finish. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"At 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Garnacha and 15% Tempranillo, this is a bit like a Catalan super Tuscan. Unusual for the region because you can really pick up on the Cabernet component. Overall it's spicy, with hints of tomato, herb and pepper along with textured dark fruit. Good for the money; drink now. Imported by European Cellars.",Spain,Red Blend
"Full and still quite bright, with brandied cherry, leather and Tootsie Roll on the nose. Quite full-force on the palate, with forward raspberry fruit. Tannic and grabby, but not raw. Solid in the classic sense, with cola, plum and cherry Lifesaver nuances. Imported by Vineyard Brands.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Full and ripe, with tobacco and a certain earthy nuttiness to the nose. Raspberry and plum are the leading flavors, while the mouthfeel is both textured as well as juicy. Full in the middle, with a likable personality. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Spicy and saucy on the nose, with some leather and cherry mixed in. Shows attractive cherry and tobacco flavors, and they are supported by ripe, pure tannins. This is a tight, ripe wine that is drinkable now and should hold for another couple of years at the very least. Imported by Five Star Imports.",Spain,Red Blend
"Gets off the blocks with Middle Eastern spice notes of cumin and curry, but later on open-cut wood and vanilla take over. Bold cherry, blackberry and black olive flavors are solid, while the mouthfeel is tannic and rowdy. Possibly too grabby for some, but if you like Tempranillo taken to the extreme this might be your ticket. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big and toasty, with graphite, rubber and leather accenting pure black-fruit aromas. This is one ripe, tannic Rioja, but it's pure and the berry flavors sing a nice song. Solid on the finish, with length and feel. Shows the right stuff without blowing you away. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Miguel Angel de Gregorio makes wines that match his exuberant personality, and Aurus, with 85% old-vine Tempranillo and 15% Graciano, is his premier offering. The 2001's exotic nose pumps licorice, clove, nutmeg and vanilla on top of the ripest black-fruit aromas going. With pillowy tannins, unmatched breadth and huge flavors of blackberry, plum and chocolate, there's no denying this wine's quality and stature.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Who else but Vega holds wines for more than 10 years before their release? This gorgeous Único spent 104 months in large casks and smaller barrels, yet there's virtually no overt wood. The nose is foresty and complex, with hints of tomato, leather and licorice. Flavors of plum, cherry and vanilla are otherworldly, and there's enough tobacco to conjure memories of a fine cigar. A Tempranillo-Cabernet-Merlot blend worthy of its reputation.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Talk about a wine that's tight as a bank vault. You almost need a pick and axe to get into this bruiser. The bouquet is drawn in, with toast, lemon peel and pure belt leather adding a manly element to the earthy fruit that lurks below. What a pedigree on this single-vineyard alta expressión red, and the coffee-flooded finish goes on and on. Hold until 2009. 125 cases made.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Aalto is one of several smaller projects being led by former Vega Sicilia head winemaker Mariano García, and we think this 2001 Pagos Seliccionados (PS) is his best effort to date. The wine is dark, with charcoal, lemon and pure black-fruit aromas. It features a brilliant luster and deep, rich, syrupy flavors of maple, boysenberry and black cherry. Shows a beautiful finish and amazing depth. Hold until 2006–07.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Simple and clean, with a pretty rose tint and basic but nice berry and leather aromas. Quite natural, with fresh cherry and raspberry flavors. Full and grabby on the finish as it hits the spot. Drink this year.",Spain,Rosé
"Oak, cherry and raisin make for a warm bouquet, and there's initial weight to the palate. But then grabby tannins and cutting acidity take over, pushing the fruit toward zesty, even thin. A light and ready style, for certain.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Good and fruity, with smoky oak and a ton of natural and barrel-aided spice. Solid black cherry and raspberry flavors sit at the core of this fast-maturing Tempranillo, while racy acidity keeps it fresh and healthy. Notes of cedar and cinnamon are pleasant. Drink or hold through 2008. Imported by 57 Main Street Wine Co.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Lively prune and raisin aromas are nice, even if a bit of alcohol mars the nose. Flavors of caramel and vanilla satisfy, while the sugary finish is borderline cloying but manages to hold the line. Very nice and just right for sweet-toothed sherry novices.",Spain,Sherry
"Potent to start, with heavy oak notes that conjure memories of pickle barrel and malt vinegar. Airing opens it up, and below there's black cherry, cassis and a lot of sticky, hard tannins. Patience and hearty food are needed, but it has its qualities. Suavity, however, is not among them. Imported by Vinamericas Selections.",Spain,Red Blend
"Sleek and fruity, with round, mature aromas and flavors of strawberry and raspberry. Pleasant more than complex, with some acidic verve and a core of healthy fruit. Easy to like, with a lot of flavor. Drink now through 2006. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez/Fine Estates from Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Apple, petrol and mineral define the nose. The lime and apple on the tongue are standard and crisp. Medium weight on the palate, with some sweetness. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"With this wine the Egurens of Rioja fame have hit the mother lode in Toro. The '01 version of Termanthia is outrageously powerful and deep, like a shot to the jaw from Lennox Lewis in his prime. It's maxed out in terms of leather, smoky oak, and depth of fruit. Almost hard to describe, it's so big and mauling. Hold until at least 2008. 330 cases made.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Huge and on the border of overwhelming. But if you like yours concentrated and forward (although arguably not that complex) then Pingus is a dream come true. Start with the bouquet of coffee, earth, black truffle and smoked meat before digging into the wine's saturated black-fruit palate. Big tannins on the finish say lay it down for several years.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Yet another portly, gorgeous wine from Allende, one that well serves the single-vineyard train of thought. Entirely international in style, with pure plum, blackberry and vanilla aromas and flavors. Super concentrated and unctuous, with soft tannins and an all-out finish. And the acidity is as integrated and proper as possible.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Since coming into existence in 1988, this winery has made rich, modern reds that represent the best of what new-age Rioja is about. And the 2001 could be the best yet, as it offers aromas of rose petals, fresh lemon, cola, soy, coffee, leather and more. Definitely a powerhouse, with huge fruit from front to back. Lively in terms of tannins, with the expected monster oak. Employs 10% Graciano in addition to Tempranillo.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Super rich and syrupy, which is just the way you want it. But what makes it great is that there's also a giant streak of balancing acidity that runs right up the gut. Reeking of prune, coffee and mocha is the nose, while the palate is pure bliss, a mix of spice, chocolate and raisin. A shining star from little-known Málaga.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Clean and sweet, with an aromatic touch of cookies and cream. In the mouth, it's more of the standard lemon, apple and mineral that you expect from this Galician white. Finishes easy and nice, but not too crisp.",Spain,Albariño
"Loaded with tropical fruit, with ample size to the nose and palate. Tastes more of live-wire citrus than anything else, and the zesty finish definitely hums along at a quick pace. Lasting notes of grapefruit and mineral are typical and welcome.",Spain,Albariño
"Red cherry, cough drop and a touch of mushroom work the nose, while in the mouth it's crisp and pointed, with light red fruit and citrus-influenced flavors. A lean, lithe wine very much in the pie cherry realm.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This semisweet white can come across likable or awful, depending on your mood and the shape of the bottle you're drinking. The sample we tried for this review was in perfect shape, and it showed tropical fruit and pineapple aromas in front of sugary mango and melon flavors.",Spain,White Blend
"Roasted and woodsy on the nose, with a base scent of raisins. The palate pushes tight cherry flavors and a little citrus, while the feel is uncomplicated and light.",Spain,Red Blend
"Aromas of coffee, balsamic vinegar and cedar, but not much fruit, send this wine on its way. Flavors of plum and cherry are standard but clean, while the finish is fruity and offers hints of licorice. A touch sharp but likable.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big and colorful, with strawberry and rubber aromas. A good amount of citrus and raspberry creates a lengthy palate that forces its game on you. Not a strong finish, but nice along the way.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Fairly soft and fruity on first inspection, with some dusty notes to the nose along with a hint of wood. The palate shows cherry, plum and tangy acids. It finishes dry and a bit oaky. Not a complex red, but solid enough.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A touch heavy and sulfuric at first, but better with airing. Aromas of licorice and black plum come right off the bat, followed by flavors of raspberry, spice and pepper. Finishes smooth and in a couple of layers, with a coffee-like bitterness at the very end. Limited but a gritty contender.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Clean but rugged, with meaty, solid aromas. Cherry, berry and cola create a sturdy, fruity attack, while the finish is round and medium in size. A pedestrian, good red for everyday drinking.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A total fruitball from front to finish. The nose yields pineapple, peach and grapefruit, while the palate pumps out plenty of apple, lemon and other citrus fruits. Finishes snappy, with zest galore.",Spain,Verdejo
"This is a nice blend of three-fourths Garnacha and one-fourth Tempranillo. It smells sweet and ripe, while the palate features bright cherry and candied fruit. Finishes light and easy, with an added shot of zip and freshness.",Spain,Garnacha
"Hay aromas mix with gritty vitamin notes, while the palate shows white peach and apple flavors. Soft, but it's easy and familiar. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Off dry, with green herbs and candy corn on the nose. Stays the course on the palate, with sweetness and just enough offsetting zest. Best for fans of sweet wines. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A serious and intense wine, with coffee and mocha on the nose, and a sharp dried-apricot and toasted-nut character on the palate. Power is this wine's calling card, as it hits like a bomb. The flavors are huge, the mouthfeel big but balanced. This is aged Oloroso in top form.",Spain,Sherry
"Smooth, smoky and leathery is how this winner gets going, and backing that up is a palate of laser-beam intensity. This offers nothing less than an explosion of plum and cherry flavors, but the style is clean and fresh, not heavy or overoaked. Already it shows nice evolution, as it comes across drinkable. Ethereal in how the finish just slips away. Only 375 cases produced.",Spain,Red Blend
"René Barbier, the pioneer of Priorat, pulled together a beautiful wine in what was, at best, a mediocre vintage. Admittedly, it starts out coarse and grainy, but airing shows juicy red fruit and a level of complexity that's up there. More the total package than a collection of spare parts; as a result, it'll drink wonderfully around 2006-07. A mix of Cabernet, Cariñena, Garnacha and Syrah.",Spain,Red Blend
"A commonplace yet good Tempranillo, with red-fruit aromas and some leather. Cherry and strawberry grace the racy palate, which is carried by hard tannins and raw acids. Tastes good but the mouthfeel is rough. A true country wine in every sense of the word.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Broad-shouldered and bold, but like all Guelbenzu wines, it applies the brakes where necessary. Herbal, terroir-driven characteristics pop up in between the red berry, plum and oak flavors, giving it some boost and nuance. And it gets better with airing, as it delivers coffee and buttery oak at the end.",Spain,Red Blend
"Such a pretty pink is this little Garnacha/Cabernet mix; and it tastes and smells great, too. Fruity raspberry aromas blend into the flowery bouquet, while the palate is streamlined by watermelon notes that prime the peach flavors that dominate. A mild dose of pepper on the finish is nice.",Spain,Rosé
"Clean and big, with attractive baking spice and cola aromas. Bright, deep and full of cherry and blackberry flavors, and also fairly sizable and layered. This is the type of friendly, competent wine that should please everyone, from novices up to wine snobs.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet red-fruit and red-licorice aromas are attractive and round. The palate of peppy cranberry and plum is moderately tart, although it opens up and gets much friendlier if given time. While many wines from this section of Catalonia are big and modern, this one is more restrained and will perform well with food.",Spain,Garnacha
"Grapy, bold and pure, with plenty of black fruit and healthy acids and tannins. Size and drive are what this wine is about; it never steps off the gas, all the while delivering tannic power, some bitter coffee and chocolate notes, and all the blackberry extract you could ask for.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Chances are you don't know this tasty little Crianza from near Murcia, which is close to Alicante. The wine has plum and earth aromas along with some wood smoke and citrus peel. A palate loaded with cherry, raspberry and other red fruits is smooth, open and lively. Nice and racy throughout, with the right mouthfeel, one that's neither too much nor too little.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rather thin and transparent to the eye, but that lightness doesn't translate into it being a thin, nothing wine. Just the opposite: It's loaded with leather, cranberry and tea aromas and brisk cherry and cranberry flavors. Some chocolate on the finish adds heft to this old-school wine that really seems to have been made to go with food.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Who knew that crisp, varietally correct Sauvignon Blanc was being made on the plains of central Spain? The nose deals pine and bell pepper, while the palate is zippy and zesty, but filled with apple and banana flavors. A tangy, precise finish with tangerine notes is the final act.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"The nose seems tight, almost reduced. In the mouth, plum and grapy fruit announce that this is pure Cabernet. It's dark and coffee-like on the finish. What the future holds for it is up for debate. Now it's sort of closed, yet still rather tasty.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Right from the start you know this wine is challenged. The nose is lean and green, with hints of tea and citrus peel. In the mouth, it's snappy and traditional, meaning there's American oak dill notes brushing up against rhubarb and red cherry. Proponents will cite its “classic” character while others will call it thin and not very rewarding.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Spearmint and untamed wild berry aromas start it down a slope that ends with a palate that's hot and heavy with fruit but devoid of balance and touch. There's a lot of this and that, namely vanilla and oak. But overall the wine just gets it together.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Cheerful but basic raspberry aromas and flavors is what this young Rioja is about. It feels a little bulky at first, and then acids swell up to cut it short. Almost snappy in the late innings.",Spain,Tempranillo-Garnacha
"This wine is not typical of Allende. It suffered from the heat of 2003 and thus it's overtly aromatic in a prune-like way and out of balance on the palate. If it weren't for the unusual but intriguing molasses aromas and the occasional blast of quality berry fruit, we'd dismiss it outright. Better to wait for the 2004.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An attempt at high-end Tempranillo that comes across rough and tough and not too friendly. The nose is rubbery and dark, while the palate is big and generic, with chocolate on the back end. But where this wine gets you is in feel: it's a tannic monster.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Forceful and rustic, with aromas of barnyard, tree bark and black plum. Raspberry and sour cherry flavors create a sharp-edged palate, while the finish is peppery and a touch bitter. Leaves you wanting more.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Light and easy, with simple aromas of lemon and wildflowers. Fairly forward and pronounced in terms of fruit; the lemon, pineapple and peach are all right there and lively. Finishes smooth and easy, if maybe a touch watery.",Spain,Albariño
"A touch prickly and odd at first, with cactus and canned peaches on the nose. More canned, sweet fruit appears on the palate, which is soft and modest from front to finish. Ends with the flavor of pineapple Lifesavers.",Spain,Albariño
"Ruby in color and sweet on the nose. Yes, it's a candied Grenache from central Spain, and while it doesn't overwhelm, it's steady as she goes. Plenty of raspberry and cherry on the palate is backed by a clear, focused finish. A tasty, upright, semisweet red.",Spain,Garnacha
"Butterscotch aromas are backed by a candied palate full of pear syrup. The mouthfeel is soft, and the finish everlasting due to residual sugar. Probably too sweet for most but not badly made. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Barely a step down from the more rare and pricey Pingus, the '01 Flor should fly off store shelves and restaurant wine lists. It's that good, starting with the intoxicating nose and moving through the pure palate and onto the marvelous finish. A wine that goes all the way, with spice, leather and mounds of rich, ripe fruit.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Sandeman excels with its reserve-level sherries, as is exemplified by this stand-out PX. Figs and raisins are front and center throughout, but it never sits heavily on your palate. Just the opposite, there's plow-through acidity that creates a brilliant mouthfeel and the sensation of freshness. Fabulous by itself or on top of vanilla ice cream.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Undoubtedly powerful, but lovable. The nose is wholesome and complete, a blend of earth, coffee and heavy black cherry and plum aromas. Broad on the palate, with deep levels of dark fruit mixed with copious French oak. A big-time success in '02, and proof that good wines can come from marginal vintages.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"The epitome of freshness and complexity is on offer in this delicious late-harvest Moscatel from Navarra's most innovative bodega. Lemon peel, wild flowers and piercing apricot and peach aromas carry the ultra pure nose. There's nothing funky or odd about this barrel-fermented wine; it will appeal to almost everyone who likes a well-made sweet white.",Spain,Moscatel
"Concentrated but not too heavy, at least not compared to some new-age Riojanos. Asúa shows smoky, toasty aromas and some bright cherry fruit. In the mouth, she's fresh and upright, with just a hint of Bordeaux-style leafiness but zero under ripeness. Toward the finish cola and red licorice flavors come up. Lovely and more subtle than the competition.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"My first look at this fledgling project from the folks at Osborne left me impressed. Sed de Caná is a well toasted, masculine Tempranillo with raw, smoky aromas and a broad-shouldered palate. It toes the line between spunky and tannic, but there's so much forward fruit thrown in that you can't help but like it. Needs several years to settle; best by 2008. 145 cases made.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Sweet and stewy, with overt oak that comes across as toasted marshmallow topped with melted chocolate. Very ripe, with a rubbery mouthfeel. Finishes with strong coffee and burnt notes along with sweeter jam and fudge nuances.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Big-boned and citrusy, with aromas of oranges and melon. More citrus on the palate mixes with the essence of pear and apple, while the finish is tight and rather long. A bit lacking in depth, but ripe and forward. Satisfyingly simple.",Spain,Albariño
"Full-bodied and earthy, with red plum, cola and tomato aromas. The palate mixes leafy, herbal flavors with candied cherry, and the combination proves to have issues. Finishes gritty, with hard tannins. More traditional than modern in style.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Bacon, sawdust and earth along with cassis and raspberry kick start this lively, acid-driven red. The palate offers tart plum and raspberry, all steered to a point by piercing, laser-beam acidity. Oak plays a prominent role throughout, especially on the finish. The gritty tannins, firm feel and strong acids call for a few years of cellaring.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lush and masculine, and every bit made to emphasize extract and oak. It's dark, with heavy berry fruit, density and ripeness. On the finish it turns even darker, with bitter chocolate and wood smoke. Arguably better at first; airing seems to close it up rather than expanding it. Drink now or cellar for up to five years.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Chunky and mouthfilling, but it still has lovable characteristics of briary fruit, full-bore acids and a leathery feel. The nose is slightly grainy and animal at first, but it finds its stride. Plum and berry flavors are ripe enough, and the finish offers some chocolate.",Spain,Tempranillo
"For several years we've been impressed with this under-$10 Merlot, and this year the quality and purity are once again exemplary. Aromas of smoke, mineral and sweet leather set the stage for amplified cherry, raspberry, plum and chocolate flavors. A medium-bodied but healthy and spicy finish secures the final favorable votes.",Spain,Merlot
"Earthy and dark, with forward fruit and plenty of overt wood. With lots of berry fruit, a smooth feel, and fine overall integration, this is a quintessential, well-priced Spanish wine for 2004. There's no flab or fat, but it's not hard, either. A drying, coffee-filled finish with bitter chocolate is the final act.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"The bouquet of this aging Rioja features a good mix of berry fruit, tree bark and earth. Across the palate flows a stream of strawberry, cherry and coffee. Firm tannins create a masculine mouthfeel, while the finish is dry with a tad of buttery oak. Gets better with airing and patient swirling.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ruby-red and colorful, with aromas of polished, fine-grained oak. Bright and fruity, but limited when it comes to complexity. It's loaded with chocolate, licorice and espresso, while the palate feel is one of juiciness along with tight tannins. It's aggressive and muscular, not subtle.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The bouquet offers raspberry and strawberry fruit, which is followed by a meaty mouthful of plum, coffee and bitter chocolate. The finish is defined by mocha, and the feel is derived from firm tannins. This wine feels warm, arguably borderline hot. But that's probably more a result of youth than anything else.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Stewed fruit aromas with some baked beans on the side just isn't alluring, and the lean, raw, acidic palate that some might describe as traditional isn't clicking in my book. Saving graces include milk chocolate on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"An earthy style with pickle barrel and leather on the nose. Dark berry flavors are muddled, and there's an odd twinge of citrus to the flavor profile. Never really gets it going and seems murky. Two samples tasted.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Heavy and sweaty at first, with a fat texture and forward fruit. It takes this wine a couple of minutes to show its black core and some spicy heat. Finishes with obvious flavors of oak and coffee.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rather intense and a bit clumsy, but with solid leather, baked earth and charred aromas. The palate is roasted and heavy, with grabby tannins and awkward acids. Finishes with hints of tomato in addition to more acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Leather and tar up front, followed by sweet fruit with adequate depth and plenty of plum and berry. A bit soft, touching on overripe, but pretty good despite some burnt, rubbery notes to the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fairly youthful, light and airy, with simple nectarine and melon flavors. Finishes smooth and medium length, with adequate but reserved force. Some finishing notes of creamy pear and sugared citrus zest work well.",Spain,White Blend
"An oak-aged vino joven with a nose of cherry, rubber and raspberry. At first taste, it seems overtly buttery, as if the young oak were sitting atop the wine. As you get into it, that oak seems less obvious and more integrated. Still, it's a touch bland, yet competent.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts off with heavy melon and citrus aromas, which are followed by tangy apple and pineapple flavors. Very zesty, with a certain sharpness that dumbs down any complexity that might be hiding.",Spain,Albariño
"Lots of early mint and wood, but then it loses clarity with airing. Flavors of cherry, beet and black pepper steal the palate, which is backed up by red fruit and modest tannins on the finish. Not a lot of nuance here but it's still good.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"A bit gaseous and funky, with simple dried-cherry and slightly mealy citrus flavors. Gets better with time but never really impresses. Not musty but definitely less than fresh.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"This wine shows that old dogs can be taught new tricks. Murrieta is about as traditional as they come in Rioja yet Dalmau is ultra modern. The nose is a smooth mix of plum, raspberry and tobacco, while the sizable palate pushes oak-backed berry fruit. Runs racy but not particularly aggressive. Long and satisfying on the finish.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This rather unique wine (made from Mencía) is at the vanguard of the Bierzo revival. It's earthy and leafy, with aromas of red plums and natural spice. The mouthfeel is perfect, as it's just lush and firm enough. Nearly explodes in the mouth, with fine French oak softening the blow.",Spain,Mencía
"From the outset, this beauty oozes character. The whole exceeds the parts by a sum of three, as the wine delivers full flavors, complexity and a near Burgundian minerality. This is what great Albariño is about, even if it's from a hot vintage. Spicy yet thumping with guava, banana and citrus. Simply delicious.",Spain,Albariño
"Alvaro Palacios is indeed a great winemaker, as is evidenced by this blend of Garnacha, Tempranillo, Graciano and Mazuelo. Aromas of bright cherry signify power and structure, yet it's easy as sin to drink. Shows model integration, bursting berry flavors and ripe tannins. Tasted several times during the past year but not rated until now; this wine just keeps getting better.",Spain,Red Blend
"This Ribera workhorse from before the time RDD was a hot region hangs in there. The rooty nose springs with cola and spice along with dried fruits. Red raspberry and cherry tomato make for a recognizable, traditional palate. An easy food wine; mature now but with some life still in it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Subtlety is not in the calling here. The nose is chunky, with leather and scattered fruit. Sweet plum and berry fruit is bolstered by forward acidity. Condensed and short, but undoubtedly lively.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Despite heavy oak, this wine is lean and jagged, with sharp cherry and plum flavors offset by some spice. Quite woody throughout, with a warm, solid finish. Hard tannins create a tight mouthfeel. Flavorful and real, but unforgiving.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is a new wine made by Alejandro Fernandez of Pesquera in Ribera del Duero. It's clear, defined and ripe, with earthy, spicy undercurrents supporting potent blackberry fruit. The chewy, deep palate is solid and saturated, leading into a coffee-tinged finish that carries echoes of chocolate. The tannins get larger with each passing minute; drink this with food.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Flowery, with a nice mix of sweetness, dried apricots and vanilla. Flavors of banana, papaya and apple dominate a textured, modestly rich palate. Remelluri blends about a half-dozen grapes together for its white Rioja, and the result is smooth, albeit not overly powerful.",Spain,White Blend
"The nose is nice; there's cherry, blackberry and mint. Loads of ripe berry fruit draw raves, and the finish is warm, with notes of cream-filled coffee. Tight and firm in terms of feel.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"A touch creamy and lactic at first, but it picks up leathery, more rustic notes with airing. Flavors of plum, blackberry and broad-grained oak lead into a spicy finish with both cinnamon and tree-bark notes. Maybe it's a bit basic, but it's juicy, well made and tasty.",Spain,Red Blend
"With its succulent floral aromas, you almost have to be drawn in. Flavors of melon, apple and banana are lengthy and delicious. The only stumbling block is a flat mouthfeel, which some might call plump. Shockingly, this wine is made mostly from the pedestrian Airen grape.",Spain,White Blend
"Jammy and sweet up front, and almost like a fruit roll-up as far as aromatics go. The palate is chewy and sweet, with boysenberry and plum flavors. Pretty nice in terms of mouthfeel, and for the most part it's right there. This is ultimately a basic Tempranillo, just the right wine for everyday drinking.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Pretty and lush, with a succulent nose. The palate is young, bright and fruity, with lots of raspberry flavor. The tail end is solid, balanced and expansive. With some lavender and crushed rose-petal notes, it has just enough ancillary accents to rise above the masses.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Rusty in color, with hickory, leather and dried currants on the traditional Rioja nose. More dried fruit creates a spicy palate, one with cinnamon, pepper and clove. It's fading and still fairly oaky, with fruit secondary to the wood and acids. But isn't that old-school Rioja?",Spain,Tempranillo
"The nose is generally sweet and likable, yet there's some medicinal character in there too. Very ripe and dynamic, with mint and chocolate flavors along with fast-moving currant and cherry. A bit racy and unbridled for Cabernet.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Aromas of strawberry and plum lead into a fruity, lightly sugared palate that pours on the friendly red fruit. Well made and perfectly drinkable. What a simple, modern Rioja can and should be.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Never let the price tag dictate perceived quality; you may be disappointed. This tart, choppy, clumsily extracted Tempranillo is a case in point. Where's the balance and mouthfeel? This is why we blind-taste; save your $350.",Spain,Tempranillo
"We are big fans of most Sierra Cantabria wines, but this fading, overoaked white Rioja is more or less a dud. It's weighed down by heavy, unintegrated wood notes and the finish is like chewing an oak branch. It's hard to see the point. 250 cases made.",Spain,White Blend
". Stand up and take note: this is great wine from Priorat. And that's regardless of whether it is typically Priorato in style. It trades textbook minerality for lushness, and the fruit is star quality. In the mouth, there's an explosion of grape matter that leaves coffee, chocolate, peanut brittle and vanilla. Almost drinkable right now but best from 2009.",Spain,Red Blend
"Sweet and artificial, with a strong hint of Dijon mustard, which seems totally out of place. Not sure who this is aimed at.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Floral and mildly leesy, with pungent aromas of green apple, citrus and honey. For anyone looking for steely, pure Albariño, the single-vineyard Fillaboa Monte Alto is the ticket. The fruit is crisp and zesty, the acidity just right. And the finish runs a mile long.",Spain,Albariño
"It is said that at five years a good cava starts to change for the better, and this seems to be an example of that. Classic aromas of petrol, baked apple and spiced ham precede a sly palate that's both soft and deep. Mild citrus flavors are topped by vanilla and white pepper. Mature.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Hard and tannic to start with, so it really needs time. Aromas of beef bullion, jerky and soy convey a certain smokiness, which is more geared to the nose than the palate. As for taste, it's laced with black cherry, cinnamon, vanilla and chocolate. Very tight and firm, so hold for another three years.",Spain,Tempranillo
"More jammy than previous vintages, with blackberry aromas and notes of bitter dark chocolate. Like any young Priorat stud, it hits firmly with jackhammer tannins, but there's also a likable, soft underside to it. Starts to sing with air and swirling, indicating a bright future. Hold a few years, if possible.",Spain,Red Blend
"A poster child for modern Rioja. Seriously extracted, with saturated blackberry, cola and chocolate aromas. Features excellent texture and a fine, tannic finish. If it could offer anything else, it would be additional complexity and variety. It locks onto that fruit-and-chocolate combination and doesn't let go.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This crianza is saucy on the nose, with prune, berry jam and cherry aromas. Zippy and hard, with forward black-cherry flavors. All in all it's a complete red, with nuances of chocolate and spice. Could stand for some food to tame the hard tannic structure.",Spain,Red Blend
"This five-grape blend is based on Treixadura but also includes Albariño, Loureira, Lado and Torrontès. The grapes were picked well into October, so the richness and alcohol are up there. Still, the flowery aromas are alluring and the flavors of mango, pear and apple are clean despite some oak aging. Only 50 cases imported into the States.",Spain,White Blend
"The benchmark among fino-style Sherries is La Gitana. Simply put, it's a classic. Pour yourself a copita of this beauty and sip it while munching some olives, peanuts or pistachios. Shazzam! You're transported to a whitewashed village in Andalusia. Aromas of mushroom and yeast are just as they should be. And deep within are subtle flavors of marzipan and citrus. The long, salty, bone-dry finish cleanses the palate and primes your appetite for better things to come.",Spain,Sherry
"Deep and dark, this is an excellent kitchen-sink blend (it includes Carignan, Merlot, Cabernet, Garnacha and Syrah). For those who like expressive, fruity, no-holds-barred wines, you're gonna swoon for this. The palate is super lush and full of dark cherry, tobacco, herbs and spice, while the finish is mile-long. Outwardly impressive in a modern style.",Spain,Red Blend
"Lovers of full-bodied, extracted Priorat wines know Vall Llach, and that cult sees Embruix as a good value. The 2004 is on the right track: the nose is almost impenetrable as it oozes blackberry, tar and fine leather. Meanwhile, the palate is like warm berry compote followed by espresso and dark chocolate. Very rich although not overly complex. Best now with steak or cheese, or hold until 2008.",Spain,Red Blend
"A barrel buster, with huge barrique qualities including char, chocolate and vanilla along with ripe black-fruit aromas. Spirited is the best way to describe this masculine, tannic bruiser, which is a blend of old-vines Garnacha and Carignan. Hold a couple of years to let it settle, then enjoy.",Spain,Red Blend
"Powerful is almost an understatement in describing this big boy. The nose starts out fiery and rough before settling to intense. It's all guns blazing on the palate, where tight, racy raspberry fruit holds court. With intense oak and a molten core generating 15.5% alcohol you may want to tread carefully. The ride is not for the weak. Garnacha with Carignan, Syrah and Cab Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Carignan and Grenache lead the way on this old-vines classic that is typically excellent but not quite as generous, round and whole as in previous vintages. Still, you will be impressed by the compact nose of thyme, sage and tobacco along with dry red fruit. In addition, the palate of cassis and blackberry is pure and tannic as a rock. Needs time; best in 2009–10.",Spain,Red Blend
"Fairly typical of a quality PX, with prune, fudge and leather on the nose. Runs a touch syrupy, but the flavors are excellent: the chocolate, raisin and coffee tastes are all precise and stellar. Shows some raw power at times, but also remains subdued.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Lush on the nose, with wild game, smoke and blackberry filling every void. Almost Syrah-like in its weight, more so than the other Mencía wines that are making a statement. Which only means that it's chewy, chocolaty and creamy. Finishes slightly short, with bitter fudge and vanilla shadings.",Spain,Mencía
"Leathery, earthy and entirely attractive; this is a wine that doesn't seem to have come off an assembly line. The fruit is power-packed, dealing blackberry and plum along with chocolate and spice. In tasting this it's hard to find any faults. Only the hard tannins stand out, calling for several years of cellar time. From Vega Sicilia. Drink in 2008.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"An eye-opening, intriguing wine from Somontano, at the foot of the Pyrenees. The bouquet is quite interesting, as it offers herbs, ripeness and intensity. Super dense in the mouth, with pure blackberry and chocolate flavors floating atop dynamite tannins. Tons of flavor; from the Viñas del Vero group.",Spain,Red Blend
"Inky dark, with coconut, baking spice and leather on the otherwise fruity nose. There's a lumber yard's worth of oak here, but overall it works. The spice element is undeniable, while the quality of the fruit supercedes any raw wood quality. A bit simple and forward, but nothing to take issue with.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Loads of white fruits and lees, resulting in a nose of pure toast and vanilla. Shows the perfect size and integration, with a creamy feel. Flavors of grapefruit, lime and mineral are at the fore. Classy and refined, with a proper petrol characteristic.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A high-water mark for Jean León, which usually sticks to varietal wines. Zemis, on the other hand, is a blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Cab Franc that makes its point. After a tight, bruising, sulfuric beginning, the wine finds its groove, showing black cherry, plum and earth flavors. Thorough and rewarding; a fine red from Penedès.",Spain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
"Balanced Spanish whites were rare in the hot '03 vintage, but this one is. Two female winemakers, hence the Two Victorias name, flat-out nailed this Verdejo, which pours on round peach, gooseberry, almond and mineral aromas and flavors. Clean as a whistle, with a finish that hits with power.",Spain,Verdejo
"Mildly burnt smelling, with whiffs of charred toast and forest fire. Plenty of black cherry, plum and brown sugar comprise the palate, which is also laden with licorice and spice. Numerous merits secure its place in the box seats, but could be too oaky for some folks.",Spain,Tempranillo
"84 Haciendas Durius 2003 Viura-Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Duero); $13. Quite light in color and mute on the nose, with faint apple and honeydew flavors on the smooth but soft palate. Lacks the drive normally associated with these grapes. Despite that, it tastes o.k.",Spain,Viura-Sauvignon Blanc
"Mature, with tomato and dill aromas prior to severe cherry tomato, rhubarb and vanilla flavors. At all points the wine places zest before richness, acid before body. And while it has its aged, old-world virtues, it fails to share much love along the way.",Spain,Red Blend
"Pretty heady, with baked berry fruit, wood grain and caramel on the nose. More oak frames red berry and vanilla flavors, while the light finish starts airy but loses steam quickly. Overall it's lean and lithe, like a ballet dancer.",Spain,Tempranillo
"From the start to the end, this heavyweight from Toro never really gets it right. The burnt rubber notes on the nose fight with a more pleasant blueberry fruit component. In the mouth, there's cherry and plum, but it's kind of medicinal in character. And the palate feel is over the edge, a bit fast and gritty.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Brambly and a bit green, with aromas of plum, basil and forest floor. This is one of the more tannic wines you'll encounter; the feel is like a jackhammer pounding away. But within that tannic vise there's adequate raisin, plum and beet-like flavors.",Spain,Red Blend
"Palacios started his Valdeorras winery in 2004, and in short order he has established himself as a quality leader. His As Sortes is 100% Godello, from dry-farmed vines with age. This wine is rich, with ample oak, fresh and dry fruit flavors, and a walnut-infused finish. Quite Burgundian in style.",Spain,Godello
"Pezas is the Meursault of Valdeorras. It starts with a smoky, slate-driven nose and then opens to reveal pear, green apple and vanilla flavors. Shows excellent backbone courtesy of refined but powerful acidity. One of Galicia's few ageworthy whites; good through at least 2008.",Spain,White Blend
"From extremely old Godello vines, this barrel-fermented wine comes only in magnums. It's currently showing a lot of oak, but it's also extremely well structured. It has an acid backbone that nobody could crack. Very serious, with intense apple, pear and minerality. Much like a fine Burgundy.",Spain,Godello
"One of the best efforts we've tried from Jumilla, Luzon's luxury blend starts with coconut, mint, char and fudge, and below that is a treasure trove of deep black fruit. Huge blackberry and black cherry flavors are potent as they ride on a wave of jolting tannins. An affordable shining star for a rising region.",Spain,Red Blend
"This younger-vines mix of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah is very attractive and loaded with graphite, schisty mineral and black cherry aromas. The palate comes in waves, with the first delivering plum and berry and the second offering chocolate, herbs and lavender. Quite pretty and very tannic. Hold until 2008, if possible.",Spain,Red Blend
"Intense and deep, with plenty of licorice, leather and pepper encasing serious dark-berry aromas. The wine runs round and full in the mouth, with chewy berry flavors, meaty tannins and a generous finish that's long and just a touch lemony from the wine's 20 months in barrel. A wine that speaks to you.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Heavier than ideal, with earthy berry aromas and accents of cinnamon. Overly ripe, with a lot of meat, pepper and baked berry flavors. Has its merits and faults.",Spain,Grenache
"Light in color, with some cloudiness. On the nose it's fairly lean and herbal, more similar to French Cabernet Franc or Pinot Noir than your typical muscular Priorat. Flavorwise, expect raisin and raspberry notes before a short, spicy finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"The differences between a good fino and a great fino are usually slight, but this one has pretty much all one could ask for. The nose is crisp, with hints of sea breeze, peanut and tart apple showing through. In the mouth, there's snap, saline and mineral-laden white fruits. Nothing is out of bounds.",Spain,Palomino
"The newest project from Vega Sicilia comes from Toro, where the serious wines are often gargantuan. This has a blinding violet tint and equally forward aromas. In the mouth, it's rock hard, a bruiser of the first order. To drink now would be inviting a tannic overload. Best to hold a couple of years and then serve with a juicy steak.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Lots of yeast and lees at first, but still tight, with apple, peach and melon flavors. Turns more toasty and yeasty as it opens, with a hint of dried herbs. A controlled buttery note makes for a fine final impression. One of Freixenet's best.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Moscatel from the hot plains of Alicante doesn't get much better than this. Yes, it's a bit oxidized and overloaded with caramel, but otherwise it's stellar. Lovely brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla aromas lead the way for the sun-drenched fruit to do its thing. The result is an over-the-top sweetie that excites.",Spain,Moscatel
"A compact red with aromatic hints of tobacco, violets and dark berries. Fueled in high-octane fashion, meaning it's tight, tannic and forward. While it needs five years to loosen up, now you get refined black cherry and chocolate. A stern drink for those who favor big reds. Tempranillo with 30% Graciano.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"In Rueda, sometimes the Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo taste similar. But in this case there's no mistaking things. This S.B. is sharp, with teeth to the nose and palate. Classic sweaty gooseberry aromas lead to pure citrus, slate and grass on the tongue. As good as you're going to find in Spanish Sauvignon.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Plenty of white flowers and tropical-fruit aromas signal that this is special. The palate is full to the brim with pure flavors of melon, nectarine and green herbs, while the finish is exact. Drinking this baby is like taking a trip to the heart of Salnés.",Spain,Albariño
"Round, fruity and quite exceptional in its class. This Verdejo sets the standard for Rueda; it's loaded with green melon and pineapple up front and backed by bright apple, pear and green herb flavors. Perfectly balanced and fresh. Stands out from the crowd.",Spain,Verdejo
"Treixadura-based, with Godello, Loureira and tiny portions of Albariño, Torrontes, Caino Blanca and Albilla. The whole, however, is all that counts, and this is simply an excellent white that's aromatic, dry as a bone, and fresh as spring.",Spain,White Blend
"Jumilla, a hotbed of luscious new wines from Spain, had the hottest summer on record in 2003. The result is this sweet and fleshy red blend, half Monastrell, 30% Cabernet, and 20% Shiraz. Fruit flavors of plum, berry and cherry fill a fleshy midpalate, and despite the hot weather the alcohol remains at a comfortable 13.5%. There are no pruney, raisiny notes, just fresh, sweet, supple ripe fruit and a hint of white pepper.",Spain,Red Blend
"You want color and heft? You get that here, and more. Dark, grapy aromas are lush more than rough and tight, while the palate is full of sassy black cherry fruit and a fair share of richness. No doubt this jam-packed blend of Garnacha, Merlot and Carignan is solid and rewarding. 250 cases produced.",Spain,Red Blend
"From a brutally hot vintage, this shows plenty of mineral, schist and cola aromas along with impeccably smooth fruit. It's a little racy and sheer in the mouth, but food will balance that without a problem. And along the way you should enjoy the licorice, cherry, kirsch and other crafty nuances that this fine blend of Cabernet, Garnacha and Carignan has to offer. Drink now through 2009.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mildly sweet and candied, with accents of rose petal, red licorice and high-quality raisin. As always, it's an intense wine with red raspberry, cherry and plum flavors in front of finishing vanilla and butter. It's a bit grabby and tannic, but it seems to have harnessed correct ripeness in what was a difficult, hot year.",Spain,Red Blend
"Waxy melon and apple aromas are intricate and welcoming, while the melon and citrus flavors are just as they should be. Do Ferreiro is a consistent high-end producer in Rias Baixas and its '05 Albariño is great. It picks up steam as it goes along and will go great with salads and seafood. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"Here's a really good, young Mencia that is sure to win you over. The nose is fully ripe and loaded with pure berry aromas. The juicy mouth is warm and meaty, with pure fruit and chewy tannins. Luna Beberide's Mencia pinpoints the essence of modern Bierzo.",Spain,Mencía
"After a couple of rough years, all Fluminus needed was the good 2004 vintage. And the result is splendid. This blend of Cab, Garnacha and Carignan is pure as can be, with polished leather and fine tobacco aromas entering the fray. The whole is complete and big-boned, but in the end it's more tight and compact than plush. Give it two years to show its best side.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rustic fruit aromas led by the native Samso grape cause a stir, and the wine, which also has Garnacha, Cabernet and Merlot, carries forth in the mouth, where lush blackberry and plum flavors are supported by healthy, spicy, minty oak. With tight tannins and comfortable acidity, it will drink better in a few years. Imported by Bernard Magrez.",Spain,Red Blend
"With density and purity, this is yet another fine Rioja from 2001. Contino is CUNE's so-called “modern” label, and the wine delivers ripe plum and cherry, with oak-driven cinnamon, nutmeg and chocolate playing supporting roles. A textbook 21st-century wine, with all the right parts in all the right places",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This is a pleasant surprise. From the first sniff you know it's fresh and well made. Butterscotch, apple and yeast aromas create a swell bouquet, which is followed by round apple, pineapple and white-raisin flavors. It's big, smooth and stands out from the crowd in a positive way.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"An example of a richer-styled Godello, a grape you'll only find in this small region. The nose and body are both full, and despite no oak aging, there are licorice and vanilla shadings to the ripe apple and banana flavors. Something to chew on. Unique.",Spain,Godello
"Harmonious and a bit creamy to the nose, with apple, citrus and lees. More citrus and apple on the palate, with an almondy kick. Shows fine depth on the finish, where orange notes take over. An excellent, mature cava that still has some grit.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Local wine critic Victor de la Serna is the man behind this Syrah from central Spain, and you have to admire its bright purple color and sweet plum and black-cherry flavor profile. Leaner in the middle than the downright gooey 2001, which means it's less jammy and more racy. With 7% Monastrell.",Spain,Syrah
"I love the funky amphora-shaped bottle as much as the forward nature of the wine. Starts with a full blast of toast, which is backed by a richer butterscotch aroma. This is a cava that provides a big mouthful; the palate is dry and wheaty, while the backing flavors of cinnamon and apple are live-wire.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A bit more easygoing than the PX wines of Jerez, as it delivers white raisin, milk chocolate and brown-sugar aromas and flavors. The palate is far from aggressive; in fact, it's a little low in acidity, which results in a soft mouthfeel and a short finish. Excellent stuff; just not a classic.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Aromas of overripe strawberries and caramel create a heavy bouquet. The palate offers raspberry, cranberry and pepper. Full bodied but with adequate acidity. Not stellar but functional.",Spain,Garnacha
"Grassy on the nose, with a touch of green apple to help it along. Melon, canned peach and banana flavors indicate that it was too hot in 2003 for Sauvignon Blanc. Lacks the piquant, zesty quality the wine in known for.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Starts promising, with its dark color and interesting aromas of violets, black cherry and cinnamon. But it's rather heavy and tannic on the tongue, where overbaked black fruit controls the flavor profile. All in all it's fully stuffed and chewy before turning bitter on the finish.",Spain,Red Blend
"In the past we've found this wine to be a bit flat and overwooded, but the '04 is balanced, fresh and downright lovely. Light vanilla and toast shadings accent bright peach and melon flavors, and the texture is something to behold. Excluding Valdeorras, this is Galician white wine in its most refined state.",Spain,White Blend
"A small portion of the wine went through malolactic fermentation, so it offers a lovely roundness. Features floral aromas backed by pure tangerine and nectarine flavors. Registers more fruity and smooth than mineral, with a perfect finish.",Spain,Albariño
"A powerful wine with forceful minerality. Still, it's loaded with expressive fruit that falls squarely into the pineapple/mango category. Finishes crisp but precise, with notes of wet stone and lingering nips of green apple and peach.",Spain,Albariño
"Known first for its Sherry, and second for its Port, Osborne is now making its mark with attractive still wines such as this excellent 80/20 Tempranillo/Cabernet blend. It cleverly bridges New and Old World styles, sending up seductive scents of dried fruits, meat, nutmeg and Spanish leather (wait, I hear a Dylan song in here somewhere!). But there's good fruit in the core, and soft—not dusty—tannins to round out the finish. Drink now or wait five year.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Alluring bubby, regardless of origin or composition. The bouquet is dry, clean and spicy, with crushed raspberry. Full in the mouth, with a perfect texture; the peach and nectarine flavors are delicious. Finishes a bit racy and citrusy, with pink grapefruit and passion fruit. Outstanding rosado cava. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Sweet, succulent aromas draw you in and while the wine doesn't deliver much nuance on either the nose or palate, we can't quibble with the power, purity and intensity of the blackberry fruit. It's young, tannic and tough now, so give it two years and it should be an excellent wine.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Quite raw and rubbery, with loud aromas that offer more power than harmony. In the mouth, strawberry fruit precedes a tight, hard finish.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Too much funk and animal on the nose, which is followed by a heavy palate of red fruit pumped forward by clamp-down tannins. Patient swirling helps it open up, but how much time should you have to give it?",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dark in color, with questionable cleanliness. In the mouth, it's meaty, big and unbalanced. Finishes with slight mushroom and sherry notes. The grape used is Prieto Picudo.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"The word esperanza means “hope” in Spanish, but there's almost no hope for this sharp-nosed S.B. that has little besides oversized banana and pickle flavors to offer. Barely acceptable.",Spain,Sauvignon Blanc
"Dark and intense is this Cabernet-Merlot-Syrah blend. The nose offers smoky leather and hot earth, but also a sweet perfume dominated by violets. Quite drinkable now, with soft tannins and easygoing black fruit. Best to get this one over the next year or two, before the fruit fades.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark and saturated, like a New World wine should be. The nose is lush and smoky, with deep prune, violet and rubber aromas. Rich and lusty on the palate, with bacon, mustard green, clove and cinnamon. Finishes with brown sugar, licorice and coffee. Very easy to drink; a likely crowd favorite.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Solid as can be, with powerful black cherry, earth and leather on the nose. Attractive berry and plum fruit carries the sturdy palate toward a spicy, chocolaty finish that deals firm tannins, leather and mushroom. Round, satisfying and complete.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"With red-fruit, leather and just enough funky aromas to stir the pot, this wine deserves a whirl. The body and style is somewhat tight and narrow, maybe a reflection of less-than-stellar vintage conditions. Nevertheless, it's got all that you'd want in a young Ribera red.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"To date, this year's best value among Spanish white wines is this simple but lovely fruit bomb of an Albariño from the quality-driven Martín Códax cooperative. It literally overflows with peach blossom aromas and melon flavors. Brightly labeled with orange print, it's hard to miss. And you wouldn't want to.",Spain,Albariño
"Full and robust in its approach. The bouquet is fragrant and expansive, with melon and honey aromas pouring forth with gusto. The flavors are quite delicious, a near-perfect blend of apple, melon and citrus. The word on the street is that 2005 Albariños offer great fruit-to-acid balance. This wine is an example of just that.",Spain,Albariño
"Our favorite among this winery's 2005s, Ambar offers tight, dry, precise aromas backed by driving flavors of melon, peach and orange-blossom honey. Very much on the spot; an Albariño that you can't go wrong with.",Spain,Albariño
"This smooth, stylish wine is on the way up, as evidenced by the two-point bump it's receiving from its last review, in December 2004. Today it's round and full, with aromas of hay and popcorn that draw you in. Layered through the middle, with expressive white fruit, dryness and sweetness all in one. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Sweet and welcoming; a good deal among pedigreed red wines. The nose on this 100% Monastrell from older vines is mammoth, toasty and dark, while the palate is chunky and virtually melts with blackberry, plum and cherry flavors. A real-deal red with breadth and class. 1,000 cases made.",Spain,Monastrell
"This muscular youth proves that Priorat can deliver fleshy, modern wines. Or maybe it's the 20% Merlot that's softenening the Garnacha and Carignan. Either way, look for lush plum and black cherry flavors floating on a rich, heady palate. This is more Escalade or Range Rover than sports car.",Spain,Red Blend
"Very nice apple blossom and lightly stony aromas greet you, and the apple and apricot flavors are juicy and ripe. This is an all-fruit wine with just enough acidity and minerality to keep it in shape. Finishes with citrus and melon. Drink now.",Spain,Albariño
"A classic manzanilla with aromas of honey, apple, blanched almonds and salt air. Fresh and exuding clarity not found in every fino or manzanilla. Quite apple-driven on the palate, with hints of mushroom and buttered toast. Flavorful, lithe and on the money.",Spain,Sherry
"Ripe like many of the 2003s, but still a perfectly fine Albariño. The nose is clean and peachy, while light citrus, nectarine and apple control the palate. Nothing out of the ordinary: fine body and fresh lime on the finish. good as a first-course white.",Spain,Albariño
"Round up front, although not terribly fragrant. The nose shows only subtle berry and game aromas, with a hint of bacon. Very tannic, with a foundation of bitter chocolate and earth. Tastes good, as it should, but still not the best Leda in terms of depth and mouthfeel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A blend of four white grapes, including Albariño; this is an unconventional wine made in small quantities. Starts with cinnamon and anise aromas that morph toward curry. Plenty of full-bodied spiced pear and banana flavors in the center. Unlike most everything else; could even be better in a cooler vintage like the upcoming 2004.",Spain,White Blend
"A nosing reveals just about everything but the kitchen sink. There's peanut butter, honey, mango and banana, and then later more elaborate sweet fruits rise up on the palate. Maybe too simple to be great, but very good and likable.",Spain,Moscatel
"More mature and minerally than most, with some earthy notes as well as a sharp smokiness. Apple, citrus and grapefruit flavors dominate the developed, smooth-textured palate. Nice overall, with good body. A stand-up cava.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A single-estate Albariño with clean minerality accenting flowery, grassy aromas. In the mouth, it'sforward and finely chiseled, with pure apple, papaya and saline flavors. Not run of the mill, and for that we like it a lot.",Spain,Albariño
"Violets, boysenberry and coffee make for an open, plump bouquet that functions as a red carpet for anyone willing to take the plunge. The palate is equally seductive and round, with deep, dark-fruit flavors topped with toast and chocolate. Stylish but forward; it's a wine most anyone should like.",Spain,Mencía
"This wine shows the potential and power of Valdeorras Godello, but at a fair price. It has a lot of minerality and acidity, but also a boatload of kiwi, green apple, papaya and white pepper. Unconventional for Spanish white wines and very much worth a look.",Spain,Godello
"Perfectly approachable and wholesome. Aromas of bread dough, pear and lemon-lime are alert and attractive. The palate provides a lush bowl of kiwi, apple and pear, while some citrus coats the finish. Imported by European Cellars.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Big and yellow, which is evidence of the oak aging on this plump, modern Verdejo that's made in small quantity and will appeal to those who like things such as Sémillon and Chenin Blanc. The body is full, there's fruit, weight and grip, and the ripeness versus minerality is just right. Drink now with cheese or fish. 300 cases produced.",Spain,Verdejo
"Dry, smoky and lightly fruity, this Pinot Noir-based Cava is about as good as it gets in the price range. The nose delivers distant brown sugar and burnt leaves, while the palate lays on the orange rind, peach and cherry skin flavors. Try this classy sparkler; you won't be disappointed.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"A modern-style offering from the up-and-coming region of Yecla, near Alicante. The grape used is Monastrell, a k a Mourvèdre. It's bold and packed with blackberry, pepper and other spices. It's the perfect wine to enjoy with barbecue, stews and roasts. This wine busted onto the scene just a couple of years ago, earning accolades for its full flavors and overall character. For the price, it's a big-time bargain.",Spain,Monastrell
"A barrel-fermented Verdejo, which will work for some and seem wrong to others. The nose is wood-heavy, with smoke, butterscotch and licorice. In the mouth, it's ripe and full of spiced pear and vanilla flavors. A one-trick pony in that it's dominated by oak. Still, the quality of the fruit and oak is solid.",Spain,Verdejo
"More available than most Valdeorras wines—and very good in 2005—Godeval offers a no-nonsense version of the Godello grape. There's typical slate on the nose but even more apple, pear, nectarine and banana. Friendly, with medium acidity.",Spain,Godello
"Sometimes you come across an unfamiliar label and it strikes a chord. This wine blends several grapes with finesse and reserve. There's some cedar and toast aromas that lead to raspberry, cherry and coffee flavors. Shows classic acidity, dryness and balance.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This winery, with its sketched labels, is classic O Rosal. The wine is 90% Albariño and Loureira, with some Caino Blanca thrown in. The color is pale but convincing, while the palate offers bright apple, apricot and nectarine flavors meshed with cutting acidity.",Spain,White Blend
"Clean and expressive up front, with floral aromas shaped by doses of grass, apple and pear. Tastes very good, with condensed fruit creating a nice mouthfeel. Very long on the back end.",Spain,Albariño
"Perfectly crisp and fresh, with touches of tangerine and lemon making it slightly sharp but not the least bit sour. More of a zesty version, with correct acidity, ripeness and balance. Yet another fine match for seafood.",Spain,Albariño
"All the wines in the Abadal line seem commited to serious aromas and flavors supported by honest structure. This Merlot from an obscure Catalonian wine region offers blackberry, cigar box and raisin aromas in front of additional blackberry flavor. There's also chocolate folded into the finishing layers. Integrated and properlly welded by firm tannins.",Spain,Merlot
"La Val is an O Rosal winery but its wines are 100% Albariño. This estate-grown white offers a yellowish tint with pretty aromas of buttercup and apple blossoms. It's fairly light-bodied and exhilarating, with pure flavors of apples, honeydew and citrus. Shows good acidity.",Spain,Albariño
"Spicy and savory smelling, with interesting aromas that encompass maple, chili powder, smoked meat and mildly baked berries. The palate is round and a little rough in the tannic category. But overall this wine is exceedingly pleasant, well made and pretty much ready to drink now.",Spain,Red Blend
"If you don't mind some heavy barrel char, then you'll probably like this rough rider. It has espresso and asphalt on the nose, and then you get leathery plum and berry fruit on the palate. A good wine, with a long finish, lots of oak and overall balance. In a nutshell, there's plenty going on.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not often do you come across an aged Valdepeñas red, especially one with style, structure and character. The nose of dried fruits and spices also features cigar box and tomato, while the palate of red plum, cherry and tomato is mature. With some length and intensity to the finish, this is perfect to drink now.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Scala Dei seems to have managed 2003's tough conditions, and this is endowed with sweet Garnacha-driven aromas that touch up against raisiny but don't cross the line. The palate is plump and loaded with strawberry and vanilla flavors, then chocolate shows up on the finish. The blend is 41% Garnacha, 41% Syrah and 18% Cab Sauvignon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Starts shy, but then reveals a smoky nose of dried cherries and freshly fallen leaves. Still fairly youthful on the palate, where plum and cherry flavors are braced by a ripping note of hickory smoke. Barrel notes take over on the finish, but overall it has a lot of what you want from a 21st-century Rioja.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Round and nutty, with mild floral and honey hints up front. The formula for Tio Pepe calls for a salty, crisp flavor profile with just enough complexity to thrust it into the upper echelon of finos. Slight mushroom and iodine notes appear on the finish.",Spain,Sherry
"An example of a well-made, lightweight red that puts clarity and freshness ahead of bulk and oak. The palate is racy and slick, with some peppery spice and milk chocolate along with pure cherry and raspberry. Finishes warm, tight and spicy.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"La Ina always has its own likable style. It's fresh, with plenty of apple character, and always dry as a bone. Maybe it won't overwhelm or surprise, but if served properly chilled, La Ina always satisfies. A quintessential aperitif with tapas and finger foods.",Spain,Sherry
"Sweet and candied on the nose, which  draws you in. Runs a touch chunky, with plum and licorice flavors. Good acidity creates a racy mouthfeel, even teetering on fiery. Tight on the finish, but crisp and fresh. The blend is 80% Cabernet and the rest Merlot.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Full and fresh, with pungent leather, tobacco and red-fruit aromas. On the mark in terms of feel, with laudable plum, cherry and earth-like flavors. Entirely holes-free, with ripeness that matches the wine's smooth texture.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Zesty as all get out, with a touch of spritz. Full melon, nectarine and green-herb aromas set the stage for apricot, peach and citrus flavors. Hails from Condado do Tea and seems racier than most.",Spain,Albariño
"Lucid in appearance, with mineral aromas adding complexity to the otherwise clean, floral nose. Very dry in style, with apple and pineapple flavors. So crisp and precise that “honest” is the best way to sum it up.",Spain,Albariño
"This Albarino exhibits good signs on the nose, where buttercup, white flowers and apple dance together. Stays solid in the mouth, with round apple, pineapple and light spice notes working seamlessly. Long and full late, with style and grace.",Spain,Albariño
"This Cencibel/Monastrell blend is loaded with black fruit from the bouquet onto the palate. Round flavors of plum and raspberry are balanced and forward, while the finish is full and mouthfilling. A correct, tasty wine that would be hard not to like.",Spain,Red Blend
"A single-vineyard wine made from tear must that was extracted during a light pressing. It's smooth and concentrated, with apple, melon, peach and a touch of white-pepper. Shows good acidity and style.",Spain,Albariño
"Displays pretty aromas of flowers and green apples, with bright, round flavors of peach and apple making for a pleasant palate. Offers a touch of sweetness and honey at its core. Very typical of the 2005 vintage.",Spain,Albariño
"More open than many, with lemon-lime aromas that work as a nice entry. Full in the mouth, where mixed fruits mesh together. The back palate offers drier citrus on top of a smooth, creamy body. Finishing notes of green herbs and lettuce are welcome. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Regal in presentation, with its faux-metal label and broad-based bottle. And in every edition it's one of Spain's more elegant, serious cavas. Look for slightly toasted, charcoal-based aromas backed by ripe apple and sweet citrus flavors. Very good feel and length. One of Spain's truly consistent high-end bubblies. Imported by Freixnet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Plenty of intense new oak sets the nose in a direction toward mint, licorice and black pepper. And that's all good, because the palate backs it up  with prime blackberry and cassis flavors. This is a solid wine with slightly pronounced acids and tannins. Not for those averse to a little grab and kick.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nicely balanced and a better example of the upside of Navarra than the wines that are based on or include Merlot. The nose shows some herbal character but more deep fruit notes. And in the mouth there's ripe cherry, cassis and plum. Texturally, it's very nice, and when you get down to the nuts and olts it's a very good value.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo
"Carchelo is at its best in this vintage. This is loaded with wild blackberry and leathery sass, too. Typical of Jumilla, it's big, saturated and packed with ripe berry flavors, jabbing tannins and warmth. A true hot-climate country wine but one with polish and pizzazz.",Spain,Monastrell
"Simple elegance defines this rosado. The color is perfect, the nose is bright, the fruit is forward…everything is in place. Isaac Muga and his sons know how to make rosé. They emphasize flashy fruit and a pure finish, while eschewing oak and weight. Every restaurant in America should serve this beauty by the glass, and every wine drinker should try it at least once. Impeccable with salads.",Spain,Rosé
"Hailing from a more obscure mountainous region, this Chardonnay-based white blend is a potent brew. The nose offers pointed lime, citrus and cream aromas, which are followed by vanilla-tinged pear and spice flavors. Big boned yet clean, with a piquant finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Begins with mature aromas of toast, sugared pastry and yeast. Ultra dry in the mouth but flavorful, with almost sterile apple and spice flavors. Crisp but forgiving on the finish; a good match for poultry.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Impeccably clean, with light tropical fruit gracing the bouquet. A wine that's better than the sum of its parts; the palate is lemony fresh and satisfying, while the overall impression is that of elegance and simplicity. Perfectly good but not overly flavorful.",Spain,Albariño
"Sweet and grapy on first look, but shows more complexity once you get into it. Rich plum and other black fruits carry the bulky, sizable palate. The finish offers oak in the form of chocolate and mocha. Devoid of serious nuance and depth, but charming in an easy, fruit-forward way.",Spain,Mencía
"Leathery and smoky, with woodsy aromas as well as the essence of dried red fruits. Like many classic Rioja, it's a touch racy and acidic, but that zest pushes the cherry, cranberry and raspberry fruit toward an even finish. As a whole it's snappy, with a solid core.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"The crude oil of PX Sherries, Noe won't appeal to everyone. For starters, it's thick as molasses, with heavy caramel and toffee aromas and flavors. And while there's nothing not to like about caramel and toffee, this wine is fat and chewy, arguably too viscous to drink with ease.",Spain,Pedro Ximénez
"Starts with a big, dusty nose of cherry, blackberry and forest notes. Fresh and proper on the palate, with plum and boysenberry. Finishes with vanilla and toffee, while the feel is warm and round. Very functional and moderately complex.",Spain,Tempranillo
"There's not a region or grape type that Telmo Rodríguez won't tackle, and here he's on to Moscatel in the deep south. This wine exhibits lilac aromas with hints of smoked ham and hard cheese. It's not a perfect bouquet, but it is intriguing. In addition, look for a bulky but rewarding palate featuring chewy sweet fruit and moderate acidity.",Spain,Moscatel
"Kicks off with a bouquet akin to chocolate-covered cherries before moving on to cured meat and bacon. Strawberry and cherry flavors are touched up by buttery oak, while the finish is so broad that it seems like pulled dough. Shows much of what's good about this appellation.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Begins with tight sulfuric aromas that transform into rubber and red fruit. Flavors of cherry, plum and dried herbs are tart and precise, while the finish offers some tomato. Overall it's a solid, tight wine that gets better with airing.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This well-priced red from Tarragona shows a glimpse of what the Montsant region can produce. The nose is all red fruit, with a splinter of oak. The palate is chunky and easy as it deals blackberry and raspberry in spades. Chocolate and mocha on the thick finish should please the sugar mavens.",Spain,Red Blend
"A year and a half ago this wine came acorss ripe, robust and not the least bit rustic. But now it's showing many signs of the hot 2003 vintage, including a soft structure and some stewy, leather notes. It's by no means fallen off to the point of being a poor wine, but hasn't improved and should be drunk now for best results.",Spain,Mencía
"More than 80,000 cases of this wine were made, making it “mass” by local standards. But that doesn't mean it's not a quality white. In fact, everything about it is really good, from the crystalline nose to the ripe palate to the clean, exact finish.",Spain,Albariño
"With 30% Loureira and Treixadura added to 70% Albariño, this wine offers sweet pineapple aromas in front of round melon, peach and spice flavors. Rather plump and driving, with a prolonged finish and some distant minerality.",Spain,White Blend
"Clean, lucid and attractive, with spindly tropical fruit aromas that veer toward mango, pineapple and passion fruit. A complete Verdejo with all the hallmarks Rueda is known for: apricot and peach flavors, nice acidity, and a crisp finish.",Spain,Verdejo
"You won't find a better, more affordable Bierzo than this. It carries true terroir, heft and solidity but it's not that complicated or racy. Lush black fruit is what defines the palate, while the finish is textured and creamy. Really smacks of natural character and joy.",Spain,Mencía
"Floral, with buttercup and acacia on the nose. The mouth, however, is a bit more austere and sharp-edged. It delivers steely, bracing acids and narrow flavors of green apple, lemon and tangerine. A tightlyknit Albariño made for shellfish.",Spain,Albariño
"Fairly big and yeasty, with earth and mushroom notes that offer complexity to the apple and pear aromas that dominate. Fruity enough, with hints of nutmeg and white pepper. Richly texured with a ton of body. Roundness is its calling card. Imported by Winebow.",Spain,White Blend
"Toasty, yeasty and quite composed given the price point. If you like green apples, ripe pears or lychee fruit, chances are you're going to like this well-blended and fairly smooth Cava. It's persistent and structured enough to go with appetizers or main courses.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Raspberry and a touch of citrus peel make for a light, appealing nose, while the red cherry and red apple skin flavors are cheerful, bouncy and attractive. For a basic Garnacha from Campo de Borja, this has it all: color, fresh fruit, balance and character.",Spain,Garnacha
"Rarely do you find musclebound, intense reds priced at $8 that are this good. But Luzon manages to give you a 65/35 blend of Monastrell and Syrah that is lively, loaded and eminently likable. It's all about hefty black fruit, bold tannins and flash. Only 5,000 cases made.",Spain,Red Blend
"Brutal heat didn't do a lot for Mas La Plana in 2003. While still a worthy wine, this one shows some green on the nose and palate, while the balance is weightier than normal. In its favor, there's bold blackberry and a touch of cola on the palate. Good but not up to the wine's usual high standards.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Offers an attractive mix of herb, oak and ripe fruit aromas. The palate is sunny, and thus bright fruit in the form of raspberry and cherry shines. Full and lengthy on the finish, with chocolate as the lasting flavor.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Thinning, but with catchy aromas of leather, citrus peel, forest floor and cola. The palate offers sweeping dried fruits, mostly cassis and cherry. Meanwhile, the finish is tight and guarded by mature tannins and vital acidity. Interestingly, root beer and turnip show up at the very end.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts out flowery and tropical, which is likely a reflection of the 20% Loureira in the wine. The flavor profile is dominated by peach and apple, while the finish runs long due to an infusion of Caino Blanca. A nice wine for those who like tropical fruit flavors.",Spain,Albariño
"Valmiñor's signature wine since 2001 is 75% Albariño, with 20% Loureira and 5% Treixadura. Which means it is ultra floral and a touch sweeter than a varietal Albariño. A pleasure to quaff, with citrus and mango flavors.",Spain,White Blend
"Broad and rubbery, with ripe black fruit and citrus peel on the nose. Good on the tongue, with a solid mouthfeel. And the finish is   attractively marinated, offering hints of soy sauce, molasses and sea salt. Fresh enough, and definitely forward in thrust.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Chunky and ripe, with more power and potency than precision or finesse. Which still means it's pleasant, warm and tasty. The   palate offers ample raisin and toffee, while the finish is aptly spicy. Good heft and texture, but short in the midsection.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Looks good in the glass, and smells pretty nice despite a hint of barnyard. In addition, there's cola, vanilla and plum to consider. Fairly meaty in terms of feel, but not overly expressive and not quite reaching the upper echelon. Finishes with some gritty, hard-fighting tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Leathery and maturing, as the fruit seems to be on the fade. Dry cherry and raspberry notes carry the aging palate, which is bolstered by ample vanilla. Finishes warm, with licorice and pepper notes. Likable and more traditional, but drink soon.",Spain,Red Blend
"Quite hard on the nose, with classic petrol aromas that almost smell of rubber cement. Tough and tight on the palate; it takes some effort to penetrate. Once inside there's crisp apple and lime zest. A true “nature” in every sense.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Plump and fruity, with aromatics of tobacco, leather and dark fruits. Features sweet, sturdy black cherry and plum flavors before a finish of warm earth, plum and vanilla. Very straightforward in its approach, but solid on all accounts.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A bit of brett and barnyard on the nose, with minty raspberry coming on to take over. A little leafy on the midpalate, but not what you'd call green. Bitter chocolate carries the finish. A blend of five red grapes, a couple of which are local and virtually unknown.",Spain,Red Blend
"Highly mineral, with citrus, apple and peach aromas. A touch mute in its flavor profile but still shows enough forward fruit and restrained sweetness to please. Snappy throughout.",Spain,Albariño
"Starts out showing aromas of turned earth, cedar and embedded plum and raisin. Upright and solid on the palate, where cherry and raspberry flavors are ripe, smooth and moderately complex. Layered on the finish, with fruit, herbs and acidity. Hails from the Alicante/ Valencia region.",Spain,Red Blend
"The label says the Barker is big, loud and Spanish, and it's right. This wine is a racy, ripe, lively Garnacha with weight, flavor and balance. Tastes good, with cherry, plum, coffee and chocolate all stepping up and taking a bow. Ripe and ready at 14.5%, but on the money.",Spain,Garnacha
"Pale yellow in color, with elegant aromas and flavors. To call it light would not be wrong: The wine shows grassy citrus notes but it peters out a bit on the back palate and finish. More subtle and fresh than powerful.",Spain,Albariño
"A masculine, rubbery nose covered with oak and dark-fruit aromas is stage one. Next up comes a spicy, solid palate that has some tannin and complexity to go with dry berry flavors. Not uncommon or unusual. It's got the goods, so to speak.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"Clean and pure to the nose, with lemon and other sheer citrus fruit aromas. Gets plump in the mouth, but not fat, with melon and orange-driven flavors. Good, full, mouthfilling and solid. Shows nothing out of the ordinary.",Spain,Albariño
"Lemony gold in color, with mineral-infused apple as the lead aroma. Maybe a bit bigger than average, with some roundness and chunkiness to the palate. Still it's a very good wine, one with additional mineral and citrus on the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Round and fruity, with sweet, attractive aromas. The palate is a bit dark for cava, with plum and bitter chocolate flavors. The feel is soft and foamy, with a dry, roasted note on the finish. Clear as can be; easy to tell that it's Pinot Noir. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Open and floral, with acacia and orange blossom on the nose. The palate is full-bore citrus, dealing orange and pink grapefruit. Lots of acidity and still full-bodied, with a solid finish that's zesty and lasting. Nice brut cava; offers more than average. Imported by Classical Wines.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Crisp and clean, thus it qualifies as a perfect apéritif wine. Secure in its apple and slate aromas and flavors, with a firm but persistent bead that fosters a fine mouthfeel. Best with nuts, olives, chips and especially seafood.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Nice and fresh, with defined, attractive apple and pear aromas. Dry and fruity in the mouth, with a tad of sweetness to the firm papaya, lime and apple flavors. Ripe and round enough, with balance. The total packagein cava. Imported by Classical Wines.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Seems a touch green and stripped at first, but airing brings it around. Still, there's a lot of fresh wood and resin, which somewhat masks the plum and berry fruit that's eager to emerge. Spicy on the finish, with a decent feel.",Spain,Red Blend
"Meaty on the nose, with chunky leather aromas along with mature fruit. In the mouth, it's a touch racy and acidic, which serves to bolster its raspberry and pie-cherry personality. Pretty good overall, with a sizable allotment of zest.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lean on the bouquet; there's almost zero yeast or lees character. But there is an interesting smoked-meat aroma that conjures memories of sausage or ballpark franks. Aggressive in the mouth, with green herbs and paprika. An unusual cava with confusing characteristics.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Quite aggressive and murky at first, with a gassy, heavy bouquet of leather, earth and cooked plums. A lot of dryness comes out on the palate, courtesy of starchy tannins and medium-weight red fruit. Finishes with grip, size and a heavy hand. For best results, give it as much time as you can.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Saucy and mildly seductive, with aromas of herbs, leather and exotic spices. In the mouth, however, things seem a touch rustic and burnt. The palate carries some serious zing and spice, but to call it smooth would be a stretch.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Fat and melony on the nose, with tons of pear, cantaloupe, almond and vanilla on the palate. Heavily oaked, especially on the finish, where wood resin is mostly what you get.",Spain,Chardonnay
"Riper and deeper than some in this class, but arguably overoaked and roasted, such that the finish tastes like burnt coffee and the bouquet smells of peeled tire rubber. In between look for plum, blackberry, cumin and black pepper.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This basic RdD delivers a smooth, ripe nose with doses of forest, bacon, road tar and violets, and there's some plum and blackberry at the foundation. Juicy and raw on the tongue, with racy, slick blackberry fruit. Finishes broad and medicinal, likely a sign of the hot vintage.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Ripe yet a bit chunky, probably a reflection of this estate's somewhat inland location. Shows sweet grapefruit and almond flavors, with a touch of pithy bitterness on the finish. This winery is owned by Marqués de Murrieta of Rioja fame.",Spain,Albariño
"A lower selection of grapes than the winery's superior Dona Rosa results in a fresh wine full of apple, nectarine and minerality. Not particularly complex but goes down nicely. Classic everyday Albariño.",Spain,Albariño
"Crisply made, with a strong emphasis on green apples. This is a zesty, flinty white made for warm-weather drinking. Despite being 100% Godello it has a lot in common with Sauvignon Blanc.",Spain,Godello
"A bit zesty to start, with a touch of mineral on the nose. Flavorwise, we're talking apple, peach and nectarine. A solid wine with good balance and nothing out or the ordinary.",Spain,Albariño
"Pineapple, melon and mineral on the nose are welcoming aromas. The mouth is nice, with citrus and melon flavors. Plenty of feel and body, and pleasantly wet, meaning it's fresh, properly acidic and refreshing.",Spain,Albariño
"Easygoing and balanced, with cream soda and vanilla aromas setting up orange, tangerine and green apple flavors. Crisp and right on the palate, with flowing acidity. Solid, with a touch of green herbs. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Bulky and ripe, with raspberry and punch-like aromas. If you like sweet notes like kirsch, sugar beets and coulis, this has it. Clearly the wine reflects the hot vintage, so it's soft, chewy and bent on sweetness. Good, but not an ager.",Spain,Red Blend
"A bulky, fruity style of cava that begins with aromas of floor polish, fruit essence and roasted corn. Shows much more citrus in the mouth, where the flavors run toward orange juice, lime and tarragon. Crisp and apple-based late, but never exciting enough to stir fandom.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Typically amber in color, with aromas of dried cherries merging into apricots. Tangy and sharp on the palate, as is standard. Neither fruity nor deep, even according to Tondonia's track record. Newcomers may not be impressed.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Extracted and raw, but with enough rustic country charm to make it worth a go. Four major grapes were thrown together, yielding cherry, beet and tomato aromas. The palate is ripe and edgy, with red plum and herb flavors. A tight, basic wine with ample tannin and acid.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Shows hickory-style wood aromas along with jerky, briar patch and cherry. Fairly fresh and forward, with a tangy palate dealing standard berry-cherry fare. Tight on the finish, with chocolate, pepper and coffee notes. A cut above the mass-market products; quite acceptable for the price",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Mildly sweet but not very exact or dilineated on the nose. Flavors of lime, papaya and apple run toward green, but with good snap and zest the wine makes the grade. Finishes dry and snappy, with medium depth.",Spain,Albariño
"The gold color and heavy oak aromas indicate barrel fermentation, which for this reviewer is not the ideal way to produce Verdejo. That said, this wine is made well, with plump melon and apple flavors cuddled in vanilla and wood resin. Very thick and woody; like being lost in the forest.",Spain,Verdejo
"Fairly mineral on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas rounding out the bouquet. Quite fresh and crisp, yet a bit hollow in the midpalate and on the finish. Overall this is a perfectly good Albariño, totally competent for quaffing or drinking with fish.",Spain,Albariño
"This good value features peach, apricot and some grapefruit on the nose, and in the rear is a full blast of citrus flavors. Juicy, a bit plump and full on the finish.",Spain,Albariño
"Exhibits dry red fruits and mushroom on the nose, with accents of forest and spice. Somewhat minty and forward on the palate, and arguably a touch gritty and sweet. Raw as it might be, no one can say this wine doesn't have guts. Imported by The Marchetti Co.",Spain,Garnacha
"Not a bad little quaffer. From Martinez-Bujanda, this colorful, ripe red is solid and chunky, with sweet aromas of berries and black plum. It is what you would call straightforward, with little to no complexity but lots of girth. Finishes full, almost creamy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"More heavy and ripe than expected, with a creamy, almost lactic nose. Round on the palate, with plum and black-cherry fruit. Good acidity and overall balance keep it afloat. Finishes with coffee, chocolate and spice. Not a world beater but good.",Spain,Mencía
"From Bodegas Bretón, this medium-weight red is a touch stewy, with peanut and black-olive aromas along with red licorice and Tootsie Roll. The palate offers strawberry and red cherry, while the finish is surprisingly tangy, with a shock of overt acidity.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Good but a bit less concentrated and pure than most. There's a whiff of sulfur on the nose, and in the mouth the fruit is solid but basic. Apple and melon are the key flavors, while the finish is clean but unspectacular. At 40,000 cases this is a large-production wine by Rías Baixas standards.",Spain,Albariño
"Gets off on the wrong foot, with aromas of corn and overripe apples. It steadies itself on the palate, where it's still sort of candied, with mango and cantaloupe stepping up. Has its qualities and registers entirely inoffensive. Good wine but not exciting.",Spain,Verdejo
"Raisin and liqueur carry the oaked nose, yet the palate is quite hard and tannic. Reduced a bit across the tongue, with prune, milk chocolate and beet nots. Has power and a high price tag, but it fails to stir the beast.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Shows ample apple, pineapple and apricot on the nose, and follows with sweet melon, lime and other tropical fruit flavors. Pretty good in the mouth, as it's just sharp and balanced enough to make the grade. Fairly ripe and zesty as a whole.",Spain,Verdejo
"A 50/50 blend of Verdejo and Viura that focuses on aromas of green herbs, citrus and nettles. The palate offers nice grapefruit and green papaya flavors, and they are backed by a smooth, medium-length finish.",Spain,White Blend
"Bacon and leather meld with modest black-fruit aromas on the nose of this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon-Bobal blend. It's fairly plump, with blackberry and vanilla flavors. Ripe and tasty enough, but neither elevated nor complex.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A black-colored, deeply extracted wine with charcoal, mint and burnt berry aromas. The palate is certainly ripe, as plum and berry flavors hit hard. But it's also limited in scope and complexity. A big wine with average personality. The blend is Tempranillo-Bobal-Syrah.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"A touch awkward to begin with, as the bouquet exhibits corn and hay along with ripe apple. The palate offers plenty of sweet, round flavors, particularly spiced apple and quince. Finishes soft, almost lazy. Good and ripe; not too acidic.",Spain,Verdejo
"Gold in color, with musky aromas that feature hints of butterscotch, ham and spice. Runs more racy in the mouth, with big lemon, orange and passion fruit flavors. Seems a touch unfocused and hefty, but for a bigger-styled wine it has its virtues.",Spain,Albariño
"Apple to start with, with some sweet doughiness to ease things along. Rather crisp and dry, which is all very classic. Flavors of white grapefruit and lemon are laser-like, while the finish is tight, almost sharp. Good quality; a little short. Made with Chardonnay and Parellada. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Spain,White Blend
"Classic and austere, with light toast and vanilla aromas in front of stark green apple and lime flavors. A natural dosage on a cava will result in tartness and sleekness, and here that's definitely what you get. Imported by Classical Wines.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Light as if it were even older than it is, but nicely perfumed and mild in scope. The nose is mature and woodsy, while the palate is light, acidic and still dancing with plum and cherry. Best if you don't expect too much from it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A bit sweet on the nose, with notes of caramel, blackberry and earth. Better at first, where it comes on ripe. But then it turns a little sluggish and heavy as it opens. Still, it's largely a good Rioja, maybe more in the “modern” style than old-school.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"Rich and creamy, but lacks zest and drive. The nose and palate offer sweet banana and oak, while the feel is almost too pillowy. Tastes more like a dessert than a dry white should. Still, it's neither bad nor poorly made.",Spain,Chardonnay
"More minty oak than fruit on the nose, with simple but clean candied fruit flavors. A bit short on depth and complexity, but totally drinkable, especially after some airing. Decent texture to the finish, with leftover spice and wood-based flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Starts with appropriate earth, cherry and vanilla notes, which are followed by spicy cherry, cranberry and raspberry flavors. Shows red fruit in a more traditional style, while the finish is warm, a bit oaky, and ultimately quite fresh.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Lean and woody, with mint, herbs and sawdust on the nose. The palate is surprisingly saturated and healthy, with pepper and vanilla running side by side with dry cherry and raspberry. A bit scouring and tannic.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A bit foresty and damp at first and then more open, fruity and lush later. The palate offers mostly snappy black cherry and cassis, while the finish is short but sturdy, with mild oak notes and decent tannins. Improves upon airing and will go with most foods.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon
"Grassy apple aromas carry a note of pickle, while the palate is chunky, full and delivers melon, pear and almond flavors. Chalk, mineral and green herbs are the secondary characteristics. Dry and long in the mouth.",Spain,Godello
"This Tempranillo is spicy and solid enough. The wine comes across ripe and clean, with forward cherry and raspberry flavors. It's rather crisp and basic, but it seems highly food-friendly and ultimately it's easy to drink.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Young and jumpy is this blend of Cabernet, Tempranillo and Merlot. The nose is dense and woody, with charcoal darkness. Tart blackberry flavors control the oily palate. Seems to be all over the place but goes down fairly well.",Spain,Red Blend
"Slightly vegetal and green, with spicy, herbal aromas mixed with oak and earth. The palate is kind of light and leafy for a Cab-Merlot blend, but there's enough body and mouthfeel to keep it moving in the right direction. Decent but weighed down by the veggies.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Creamy and yeasty, with mild apple and bread-based aromas. Nice in the mouth, with citrus leading the way. Shows ample kick and acidity, with length and balance on the finish. Perfectly good overall, if not overly exciting. Imported by Bon Vivant Imports.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Different from the crowd. The nose concedes light raspberry and cranberry aromas, while the palate is a pink passion play that's not that easy to figure out. It's tangy, with citrus and berry mixing in an unconventional manner. Interesting in the mouth; a quality wine. Not run of the mill. Imported by De Maison Selections, Inc.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Toast, butterscotch and oxidized apple aromas precede a heavy, nearly overripe palate loaded down with sticky apple, nectarine and banana. Where it does well is in texture, which is correct and pleasant. Finishes long and heavy. A different breed.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Earthy and ripe, with jammy, borderline stewy fruit that carries a meaty edge. Fairly one-line in terms of complexity, but it stands on its feet and tastes pretty solid. With some rustic character, it'll do the job.",Spain,Rhône-style Red Blend
"If it seems dirty at first, time will reveal tobacco and leather aromas along with black plum and coffee. Seems more sour than you might expect, with pie cherry and rhubarb flavors. Really high-toned on the finish, where it teeters on the brink of sour. Not bad but not endearing.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"Tons of color but the nose is a bit soupy, with aromas of heavy oak, black fruit, tomato and herbs. A blend of 60% Garnacha and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that's solid but shrill. Hits with extract and tannins, but the integration and flavors don't quite achieve the next level.",Spain,Red Blend
"Plump and a bit stewy, but the flavors manage to take over in a fairly positive way. Upon sipping you take in blackberry and prune, but also some murkiness. Not much in the midpalate, but decent around the edges.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Muddled to start, with chocolate and earth aromas along with heavy, seemingly chewable berry fruit. Big on the palate, with slightly overripe plum backed by overt vanilla and brown sugar. A three-grape mix of Prieto Pecudo, Mencía and Tempranillo.",Spain,Red Blend
"Starts by emitting baked plum and leather aromas, and the bouquet is backed by solid but lean black cherry, plum and raspberry flavors. Light to medium in build, with a moderately strong but bland finish that's only slightly toasted. Short on subtance but good as far as what's here.",Spain,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Starts with fruit cocktail aromas, which are backed by semisweet orange and lemon flavors. Zesty and clean, with pretty good mouthfeel but not much depth of flavor, complexity or nuance. A good wine on its best day.",Spain,Albariño
"Honey, pear and sugar cane are the dominating flavors in thi sticky, rich, unctuous sweet wine. There isn't a whole lot else to say about it: you have to have an aggressive penchant for candy to get into this style of wine.",Spain,Moscatel
"Light and sweet to the nose, with aromas of honey, which isn't normal for the usually zesty, citrusy Verdejo. Pear and apple are the dominant flavors on a palate that's more smooth and lush than racy and snappy. Strange in how it's almost creamy.",Spain,Verdejo
"Slightly prickly and green, but overall it's a decent, mildly herbal Garnacha that will do the trick. Basic red-fruit flavors carry a note of tomato and leather, while the finish is generally tight and crisp.",Spain,Garnacha
"Jammy and candied to start with. Black cherry, boysenberry and plum flavors are friendly but basic, while the texture and finish are nothing to take issue with. Perfectly fruity and easy, but runs short on complexity.",Spain,Moristel
"Light and lean, with lively fruit aromas and flavors. Freshness is what this wine pushes, because there's not much weight or overt sweetness to it. Light apple, a touch of pear, and some lemon-lime is the most that you're going to get. Still, it works as a palate freshener. Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Maybe Pinot Noir isn't meant to be in Catalonia. This has a burnt nose, with medicinal cherry and cranberry aromas and flavors. Starts sweet then goes a bit raspy. Unusual.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Heavy and high-voltage, with a strong whiff of green bean to the nose. Flavors of raisin, raspberry and green pepper combine to create a palate that has its high moments as well as its faults. Tight on the finish, with lots of tobacco and bell pepper.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A Monastrell with 10% Cabernet, and it is heavily minty and woody, with leaner than expected fruit and a whole lot of resin and vanilla setting things off. Decent structure and mouthfeel, and with plenty of oak. Not bad but nothing too exciting.",Spain,Monastrell
"Some heft and richness propel this bargain wine to a higher level. There are even some bacon, beef and leather aromas in addition to the plump fruit scents. Chewy and chunky, with flavors of black cherry and raspberry. Yet still tangy and refreshing enough to avoid being clumsy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Not too refined, but still pretty tasty. The palate offers chewy cherry and raspberry fruit, while the finish is spicy and zesty to the point that it creates a tingle. Somewhat sugary, but definitely an easy one to drink.",Spain,Red Blend
"Nice in terms of texture, but a bit strange and hard to identify as far as aromas and flavors go. The nose tosses up Sherry and syrup notes, while the flavors run toward Granny Smith apples and lime. Shockingly, the finish is sweet. Confounding and hard to appreciate, but not a bad cava.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Candied and thick right from the begininning. This is a heavy, chunky southern Spanish red comprised of 60% Monastrell and 20% each of Cabernet and Syrah. The final result is rustic, stewy and fat, with gooey chocolate and stewed plum flavors. Big and ripe but devoid of finesse.",Spain,Red Blend
"Candied and round, with tangy melon and citrus flavors. Does best early on before losing focus and finishing flat. There is okay feel and balance to it but little in the way of backing depth. Imported by VinLozano Imports.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"Hard and funky at first, with a nose that shows leather, scallion and bitter herbs. Seems to find its way a bit better in the mouth, where apple and papaya flavors are in the lead. Still, it remains unfocused and clumsy throughout.",Spain,White Blend
"More savory and spicy than fruity, with bramble and leather aromas dominating any sweetness that might want to escape. A touch aggressive in the mouth, with lively but hard raspberry and other red-fruit flavors. Finishes dry and salty, with heat. Includes 17% Carignan.",Spain,Syrah
"Tilts the scale on the heavy side. The nose is bolstered by weighty applesauce and petrol yet the palate is surprisingly lean and lemony in terms of flavors. Rather oily, and not endowed with much brightness.",Spain,Albariño
"Sweet plum and raisin on the nose go heavy and dull after time exposed to air. The palate offers some raspberry flavor, but with tang and finishing bitterness. Thick but raw.",Spain,Garnacha
"This perennial bargain-basement red offers solid fruit with herbal overtones, while the flavor profile veers toward cherries and licorice. Gets raisiny and more ponderous the more time you spend analyzing it.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Dry leather, leaves, burnt spice and pepper lead it off, followed by tart flavors of plum and berry. Never seems to find a higher level of quality as it falls off on the palate, finishing with rhubarb and cranberry.",Spain,Red Blend
"Dark and smoky, almost like a burnt wooden match on top of plum purée. Runs a bit tart in the mouth for Syrah, with red raspberry and cherry flavors. Firm and lean in the mouth.",Spain,Syrah
"Prieto Picudo is the grape, and the wine yields robust aromas of radish and red fruits. Very tangy, almost citrusy on the palate. Finishes quite lean and tart. A screechy wine without a lot of happiness.",Spain,Prieto Picudo
"Hard and waxy on the nose, with little to no appealing fruit aromas. The palate is loaded with sharp lemon and green apple flavors. Lacks friendliness; healthy in terms of feel but borders on sour.",Spain,Albariño
"Cherry and dusty cinnamon aromas blend with a touch of cough drop on the nose, while the full-bodied palate pits spicy berry and plum against rather soft acidity. Finishes sweet for a burst, then dry and peppery. Alluring rosado. Imported by European Cellars.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Sweet yet snappy, with youthful aromas of candied fruit. Slightly tangy on the tongue, with raspberry and plum flavors. Tastes clean, with a soft mouthfeel. Very standard, simple and easygoing.",Spain,Red Blend
"On one hand it shows black cherry, plum and licorice. On the other there are green, lettuce-like aromas and flavors. Along the way is some tang on the palate, length to the herbal finish, and an adequate mouthfeel.",Spain,Red Blend
"Black in color and saturated with plum, fruit cake and vanilla aromas. Big in the mouth but clumsy, with dense, thumping black cherry and blackberry flavors. In fact, everything about the wine is black, including the burnt, licorice-tinged finish. Ponderous in the long run.",Spain,Tinto del Pais
"A little heavier than ideal, with a touch of raisin along with candied black cherry on the bouquet. Better in the mouth, where it comes to life on the wings of good acids, modest tannins, and simple but proper berry fruit flavors.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Starts somewhat cooked and stewy before finding a better, fresher, fruitier groove. Weighty and full, with bright colors and aggressive flavors. Plum, berry and cherry notes dominate. Persistent airing unveils additional ripeness and soft tannins.",Spain,Red Blend
"Very sweet, with cherry cola and licorice nibs comprising the nose. It's nothing more than simple Garnacha, which means it's all about red fruit and sunshine. Not a fine wine, but good for those with a sweet tooth.",Spain,Grenache
"This co-op wine is almost a good deal, but ultimately it does not show enough depth or elegance to reach the next level. The nose is a touch stewy and lifeless, while the palate offers chewy raisin, plum and berry. Flat on the finish, with a syrupy feel.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Yellow in color and heavy on the nose. Toast is the lead aroma, and with that there's some caramel and peanut butter. Dry and lean in the mouth, with lemon and grapefruit notes. Still, it has class and style to it; not a dullard. Fairly unique. Imported by CIV/USA.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Mildly sulfuric, with vitamin, bitter greens and funk on the nose. Melon and banana flavors are of the soft, dilute type. Seems burnt and herbal. Not fresh enough.",Spain,White Blend
"A ton of bell pepper and tomato sits front and center on the nose, which almost ensures that the flavors will be herbal and leafy. They are, yet the feel in the mouth is decent and the tannin-acid balance adequate. A blend of 50% each Cabernet and Merlot.",Spain,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot
"Brass colored, with aromas of apple cider and mineral. Heavy in the mouth with jumpy, tangy fruit and overt acidity. Okay if a bit mealy.",Spain,Albariño
"Roasted and hard from the initial take, with earthy, leathery aromas that don't illicit a smile. Tart, dilute and fading, with apple and cherry skin on the palate. Quite sour and thin at this point of its evolution and surely not getting better. Imported by Kensington Distributors Inc.",Spain,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon
"Mealy on the nose, with corn and pear syrup making for a less than fresh bouquet. Bland apple and orange flavors are okay but not that stimulating, while the overall take is that it tastes too much like citrus juice and not enough like balanced wine.",Spain,Albariño
"Violet in color, with burnt rubber, cherry and plum on the lively nose. Things go south from there, however, as the palate is too snappy and austere to support the flavors. It's 90% Carignan and much like a tart Italian Dolcetto. Imported by Hand Picked Selections.",Spain,Carignane
"Thick on the nose, with prickly, mildly pickled aromas. Typical of Jumilla, the wine is big and candied, with soft tannins and spiky, out-of-place acidity. Finishes tart and crisp with virtually no second level to speak of. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Rusty in color, with nutty, leathery aromas that feature little to no fruit. Quite sour in the mouth, and drying on the finish. Just not that pleasant; it's definitely not what you'd expect from Merlot. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Spain,Merlot
"Jumbled, jammy and disjointed, with a heavy load of extracted, overdone fruit. Deep and hard, with funky aromas and a disconcerting mouthfeel. A wine with issues. Imported by VinLozano Imports.",Spain,Tinta de Toro
"Balsamic vinegar, burnt coffee and pepper aromas create a bouquet that's more like salad dressing than fine wine. The flavors are peppery and herbal, yet the body is full and the mouthfeel not bad. A blend of four grapes, led by Garnacha and Tempranillo. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Red Blend
"Mulchy and earthy from start to finish, with distant flavors that barely register. Not overly bad but a true cipher of a wine. Imported by Kensington Distributors Inc.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Foxy, animal aromas don't distinguish it, while robust but mulchy berry and plum flavors fail to take it very far. Barely acceptable. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Spain,Garnacha
"Light and lemony, with a hint of green astringency. Tangerine with hints of mushroom on the palate run toward a solid but lean finish. Has zest but little roundness. Fresh and crisp, but not the most friendly bubbly.",Spain,White Blend
"Not every wine is easy to read: this one is a case in point. The nose offers sweet toffee and apricot, while the palate starts out toasty and dry before unveiling ripe peach and brown sugar. The dosage on this wine is unusual. A funky bubbly that's worth a try.",Spain,Pinot Noir
"Licorice, pepper and raisin join forces on a can't-miss bouquet that's all Monastrell and all southern Spain. Dark and candied, with tons of cooked brown sugar. This is what you'd call big and tannic, with a hard, grabby mouthfeel. One glass we can recommend; two or more might be tough to handle.",Spain,Monastrell
"Loud and basic, with ripe fruit aromas and flavors but also a detectable heaviness. The palate pushes ripe apple and pear, while the finish is big but quiet. Deep and dense but dull along the edges.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Avinyo does not make cookie-cutter cavas, and thus this wine is out of the ordinary and not always the better for it. The nose is lean and spritzy, with aromas equal to lemon-lime. The palate is drawn in for a brut, with tart flavors. Slim in profile, but not a bad or indifferent wine.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Dusty cherry aromas start out full and turn more green and grassy with time. Sweet grapefruit and tang carry the palate, and the finish is a rush of acidity. Good but odd.",Spain,White Blend
"Full and heavy, with mango and orange juice flavors. Creamy in the mouth, with a full, foamy feel. Good citrus and apple characteristics keep it moving forward, while the weight is definitely there. Good in cava cocktails or as a Spanish mimosa.",Spain,Sparkling Blend
"Shows yeasty, earthy, dusty aromas, with just a slight trace of fruit. There are also mild fruity flavors. It's slightly sweet as a semi-seco should be, but has adequate acidity and decent length finishing with some richness.",Spain,Champagne Blend
"With its dried-cherry and rose-petal aromas and flavors, this beautiful, mature red is every bit the equivalent of a fine, older Bordeaux or Burgundy. Cumin and cinnamon show on the palate and the refined finish is lovely, with anise and white pepper accents.",Spain,Tempranillo
"The bouquet of dried cherries, plums, prunes and tobacco opens to a palate of dense fruit that's dry and structured. This wine is big, but even textured and not heavy. Shows finely focused fruit and good grip. The dark fruit flavors add spice accents on the long finish. Cellar Selection.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Deep, sweet dark-cherry fruit forms a solid foundation for this impressive wine. There's a touch of menthol oak on the nose; plenty of leather and earth accents in the mouth, coupled with good acidity, keep the palate complex and lively. Finishes long, with full—but not harsh—tannins. Editors' Choice.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Beautifully balanced, this shows all the positive attributes of mature Rioja. Though 30 years old, it is still very alive, with deep sweet fruit that wears tobacco and meat accents. Anise accents the ultrasmooth palate. Full of complex flavors, with a lingering finish.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Nose of ripe spicy fruit with tobacco and earth accents. Similar full, chewy flavors ride the plush mouthfeel. The long finish is dense and dark.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This is classic Rioja Reserva, with textbook cherry, earth, leather and meaty Tempranillo flavors supported by a good acid spine and moderate tannins. The elegant finish is dry and spicy.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Sweet cherry and dried-rose notes on the nose are offset by some noticeable barnyardy scents. Elegant, but less generous on the palate and decidedly drier than the much older 1970, this finishes with dry tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo
"Toasty oak and tobacco shadings are wrapped around the dark-cherry fruit core of this 100% Tempranillo wine. The full and supple palate shows good depth of fruit, leather and spice accents. This handsome modern-style Rioja finishes long and tangy, with moderate tannins.",Spain,Tempranillo Blend
"This pleasant wine shows clean apple, hay and mildly floral aromas. Even and round on the tongue, it has a slightly waxy feel and decent acidity. Green apple, citrus and slightly nutty flavors play on the finish, with a crisp, dry grapefruity aftertaste that lingers. Best Buy.",Spain,Viura
"Dried cherry and spice aromas and flavors accented by peppery, meaty notes mark this joven (young wine). A blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Mazuela, it has a light, even mouthfeel. The acids are tangy, and a little prickly now, and the bright finish shows spicy elements.",Spain,Tempranillo
"A straightforward basic red, with dried cherry, oak and slightly meaty scents. The palate shows dark fruit and spice flavors, medium weight and an even texture. Finishes with decent length and tangy, spicy notes.",Spain,Tempranillo
"This Rioja rose displays a full bouquet of rose petal, spice and the slightly meaty element that Tempranillo so often shows. No White Zinfandel, this is a fairly lean and dry wine with spicy notes, a decent match for hors d'oeuvres or light meals.",Spain,Rosé
